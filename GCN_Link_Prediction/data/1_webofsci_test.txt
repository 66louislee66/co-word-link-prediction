AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a long-term, highly prevalent disease that
   provides extensive data support in spatial-temporal user case data
   mining studies. In this paper, we present a novel T2D food access early
   risk warning model that aims to emphasize health management awareness
   among susceptible populations. This model incorporates the
   representation of T2D-related food categories with graph convolutional
   networks (GCN), enabling the diet risk visualization from the geotagged
   Twitter visit records on a map. A long short-term memory (LSTM) module
   is used to enhance the performance of the case temporal feature
   extraction and location approximate predictive approach. Through an
   analysis of the resulting data set, we highlight the food effect
   category has on T2D early risk visualization and user food access
   management on the map. Moreover, our proposed method can provide
   suggestions to T2D susceptible patients on diet management.

AB This paper proposes a new Quantum Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural
   Network (QSGCNN) model that can directly learn a classification function
   for graphs of arbitrary sizes. Unlike state-of-the-art Graph
   Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) models, the proposed QSGCNN model
   incorporates the process of identifying transitive aligned vertices
   between graphs and transforms arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized
   aligned vertex grid structures. In order to learn representative graph
   characteristics, a new quantum spatial graph convolution is proposed and
   employed to extract multi-scale vertex features, in terms of quantum
   information propagation between grid vertices of each graph. Since the
   quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures of the input
   vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not alter the original
   spatial position of vertices), the proposed QSGCNN model allows to
   directly employ the traditional convolutional neural network
   architecture to further learn from the global graph topology, providing
   an end-to-end deep learning architecture that integrates the graph
   representation and learning in the quantum spatial graph convolution
   layer and the traditional convolutional layer for graph classifications.
   We indicate the effectiveness of the proposed QSGCNN model in relation
   to existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on benchmark graph
   classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   QSGCNN model.

AB In recent years, skeleton-based action recognition has become
   increasingly popular in the field of human action recognition, and graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown better advantages in this task.
   Many GCN-based methods are insufficient in the latent relationship
   between features, which affects the discriminability of features being
   not rich enough. These potential feature relationships can manifest as
   feature differences that change due to actions and feature correlations
   that interact with each other. Therefore, we propose a feature
   difference and feature correlation learning mechanism to learn
   discriminative augmentation features, including feature differences in
   actions and feature correlations between joints. First, we propose a
   temporal feature difference and correlation learning module (FDCL)
   (TFDCL). In adjacent temporal frames, we extract feature correlations
   between related parts. Feature differences are captured through changes
   in joints over the overall long-term timeline. Second, we propose a
   channel FDCL module. Different channels contain different types of
   features for actions. We use convolution operations to interact between
   channels, continuously extracting the strongest features to obtain
   feature maps. Third, we propose a temporal channel context topology
   (TCCT) module to dynamically learn global contextual features of all
   joints during motion. Finally, experiments are conducted on the NTU-RGBD
   60 dataset and the kinetics-skeleton 400 dataset to verify the
   effectiveness of the network.

AB With the rapid growth of population, more diverse crowd activities, and
   the rapid development of socialization process, group scenes are
   becoming more common, so the demand for modeling, analyzing, and
   understanding group behavior data in video is increasing. Compared with
   the previous work on video content analysis, factors such as the
   increasing number of people in the group video and the more complex
   scene make the analysis of group behavior in video face great
   challenges. Therefore, a group behavior pattern recognition algorithm
   based on spatio-temporal graph convolutional network is proposed in this
   paper, aiming at group density analysis and group behavior recognition
   in the video. A crowd detection and location method based on density map
   regression-guided classification was designed. Finally, a crowd behavior
   analysis method based on density grade division was designed to complete
   crowd density analysis and video group behavior detection. In addition,
   this paper also proposes to extract spatio-temporal features of crowd
   posture and density by using the double-flow spatio-temporal map network
   model, so as to effectively capture the differentiated movement
   information among different groups. Experimental results on public
   datasets show that the proposed method has high accuracy and can
   effectively predict group behavior.

AB Recent progress in spectral classification is dominated by the use of
   deep learning models. While various learning architectures have been
   developed, they all extract spectral features from a single-view input.
   In this article, we investigate a different perspective and develop a
   unified multiview spectral feature learning framework, which extracts
   discriminative spectral features from multiple views of inputs. To our
   knowledge, this is the first reported multiview spectral feature
   learning method based on deep learning. In this framework, we introduce
   a multiview spectrum construction method by transforming the input
   spectral vector into multiple 3-D image patches with different sizes,
   termed multiview spectrum. This multiview spectrum is fed to a
   well-designed triple-stream architecture, where global and two local
   spectral feature learning networks operate in parallel, thus capturing
   both global and local spectral contextual features simultaneously.
   Another important contribution of this work is a novel interactive
   attention mechanism to identify the most informative spectral contextual
   features. The model is trained in an end-to-end fashion from scratch
   with a joint loss. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate
   excellent performance compared to the current state of the art.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is a challenging task due to the
   high complexity of HSI data. Subspace clustering has been proven to be
   powerful for exploiting the intrinsic relationship between data points.
   Despite the impressive performance in the HSI clustering, traditional
   subspace clustering methods often ignore the inherent structural
   information among data. In this article, we revisit the subspace
   clustering with graph convolution and present a novel subspace
   clustering framework called graph convolutional subspace clustering
   (GCSC) for robust HSI clustering. Specifically, the framework recasts
   the self-expressiveness property of the data into the non-Euclidean
   domain, which results in a more robust graph embedding dictionary. We
   show that traditional subspace clustering models are the special forms
   of our framework with the Euclidean data. On the basis of the framework,
   we further propose two novel subspace clustering models by using the
   Frobenius norm, namely efficient GCSC (EGCSC) and efficient kernel GCSC
   (EKGCSC). Each model has a globally optimal closed-form solution, making
   it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice. Extensive
   experiments strongly evidence that EGCSC and EKGCSC dramatically
   outperform current models on three popular HSI data sets consistently.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible
   neurodegenerative disease. Neuroimaging based on magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) is one of the most intuitive and reliable methods to
   perform AD screening and diagnosis. Clinical head MRI detection
   generates multimodal image data, and to solve the problem of multimodal
   MRI processing and information fusion, this paper proposes a structural
   and functional MRI feature extraction and fusion method based on
   generalized convolutional neural networks (gCNN). The method includes a
   three-dimensional residual U-shaped network based on hybrid attention
   mechanism (3D HA-ResUNet) for feature representation and classification
   for structural MRI, and a U-shaped graph convolutional neural network
   (U-GCN) for node feature representation and classification of brain
   functional networks for functional MRI. Based on the fusion of the two
   types of image features, the optimal feature subset is selected based on
   discrete binary particle swarm optimization, and the prediction results
   are output by a machine learning classifier. The validation results of
   multimodal dataset from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   open-source database show that the proposed models have superior
   performance in their respective data domains. The gCNN framework
   combines the advantages of these two models and further improves the
   performance of the methods using single-modal MRI, improving the
   classification accuracy and sensitivity by 5.56% and 11.11%,
   respectively. In conclusion, the gCNN-based multimodal MRI
   classification method proposed in this paper can provide a technical
   basis for the auxiliary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB Graph representation learning aims at mapping a graph into a
   lower-dimensional feature space. Deep attributed graph representation,
   utilizing deep learning models on the graph structure and attributes,
   shows its significance in mining complex relational data. Most existing
   deep attributed graph representation models assume graph attributes in a
   single-attributed view. However, rich information in real-world
   applications demands the ability to handle multiple attributed views.
   For example, in social network users' profiles and posts represent two
   distinct attributed views. A single-attributed view or a simple ensemble
   of them fails to represent the rich information and complex relations
   therein. To confront this challenge, this paper proposes a novel deep
   unsupervised graph representation learning model, called
   Multi-attributed-view graph Convolutional AutoEncoder (MagCAE). MagCAE
   learns the node-pairwise proximity among multi-attributed views and node
   embeddings, across which a novel loss function is designed to preserve
   the node-pairwise likelihood. An aggregation layer is specially
   developed in MagCAE to optimize the weights of embeddings on
   multi-attributed views. The extensive experiments on four datasets
   demonstrate the superiority of MagCAE over twelve baselines.

AB Distributed resources at a grid's end cannot upload operational power
   data to local centers due to data transmission and privacy issues. This
   leaves the centers with incomplete information, thus impacting decision
   making. This paper presents a virtual aggregation-based model for such
   scenarios. We define four virtual aggregate types based on resource
   response characteristics. Using characteristic coefficients, we identify
   these aggregates' categories and proportions from bus power. To address
   blind source separation in single-channel power signals, we apply the
   Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Fast Independent Component
   Analysis (EEMD-FastICA) method. This helps extract and analyze bus
   power, thereby deriving power curves for different aggregates. Moreover,
   we use a graph convolutional network to explore how factors like date,
   time, weather, and pricing intertwine with aggregate power. We develop a
   predictive model with an advanced SpatioTemporal Graph Convolutional
   Network (STGCN), thus facilitating proactive power forecasting for
   virtual aggregates. Case studies show our method's efficacy in
   extracting power curves under limited information, with the STGCN
   ensuring accurate, forward-looking predictions.

AB Parameter identification plays an important role in power system. The
   existing parameter identification methods usually have two limitations:
   1) the existing methods only consider the information of single branch
   and ignore the influence of adjacent branch information, and do not
   effectively use the topological structure constraints of the power grid;
   2) the measurement data has the problems of poor numerical stability,
   numerical divergence and noise interference. Data contamination has
   become an important factor restricting the prediction accuracy of branch
   parameters. In order to solve these problems, this work proposes an
   automatic weighted loss-graph convolution networks model combined with
   the spatial structure of power grid. Based on the graphical modeling,
   the correlation between power grid branches is effectively used, and the
   adjacent branches are used to provide more effective information for the
   parameter identification of a branch, which improves the identification
   accuracy. In addition, the model enhances the local characteristics
   through the power grid structure information constraints, realizes the
   local optimal fitting, and constructs a self tradeoff loss function to
   weaken the impact of pollution data (data noise and data loss) on the
   model. The test results show that compared with the traditional method,
   this method has higher accuracy and stronger robustness.

AB Distantly supervised relation extraction is the most popular technique
   for identifying semantic relation between two entities. Most prior
   models only focus on the supervision information present in training
   sentences. In addition to training sentences, external lexical resource
   and knowledge graphs often contain other relevant prior knowledge.
   However, relation extraction models usually ignore such readily
   available information. Moreover, previous works only utilize a selective
   attention mechanism over sentences to alleviate the impact of noise,
   they lack the consideration of the implicit interaction between
   sentences with relation facts. In this paper, (1) a knowledge-guided
   graph convolutional network is proposed based on the word-level
   attention mechanism to encode the sentences. It can capture the key
   words and cue phrases to generate expressive sentence-level features by
   attending to the relation indicators obtained from the external lexical
   resource. (2) A knowledge-guided sentence selector is proposed, which
   explores the semantic and structural information of triples from
   knowledge graph as sentence-level knowledge attention to distinguish the

AB Ergonomic risk assessment (ERA) is commonly used to identify and analyze
   postures that are detrimental to the health of workers in industrial
   workplaces, which is vital to prevent work -related musculoskeletal
   disorders (WMSDs). Among the automatic approaches, algorithms based on
   graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promising results in ERA
   using skeleton sequence as input. However, previous GCNbased methods
   still have certain limitations. First, the separated modeling of spatial
   and temporal information and the manually pre -defined topology of graph
   may restrict the representation diversity of the networks. Additionally,
   RNN-based temporal modeling often incurs high computational costs and
   fails to capture longrange temporal dependencies, thereby reducing
   flexibility in describing long videos. To overcome these challenges, in
   this study, we propose an attention -based adaptive spatial-temporal
   graph convolutional network (AAST-GCN), aiming to achieve effective and
   efficient action representation for ERA in long video. First, we employ
   an alternate modeling strategy to effectively capture the
   spatial-temporal information, and propose an improved adaptive adjacency
   matrix scheme to learn various coordination and relations of body
   -joints, thus enhancing the flexibility to model diverse postures.
   Furthermore, we introduce an efficient multi -scale temporal
   convolutional network as a replacement for RNN-based algorithms,
   enabling the network to extract various granularities of temporal
   features. Moreover, to make the network focuses on more valuable
   information, we employ a spatial-temporal interaction attention (STIA)
   module. Finally, the aforementioned modules are aggregated within a
   multi -task learning framework, with the action segmentation serving as
   the auxiliary task to further improve the accuracy of ERA. We conducted
   the ergonomic risk assessment on the UW-IOM and TUM Kitchen datasets
   using our network. Extensive experiments conducted on the most popular
   datasets UW-IOM and TUM Kitchen demonstrated that our proposed AAST-GCN
   outperforms other GCN-based methods. Ablation studies and visualization
   also prove the effectiveness of the individual sub -modules.

AB Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to recognize human actions
   from given skeleton sequences. The literature utilizes fixed-stride
   sampling and uniform aggregations, which are independent of the input
   data and do not focus on representative motion frames. In this paper, to
   overcome the challenge of the fixed uniform aggregation strategy being
   unable to focus on discriminative motion information, a novel
   non-uniform motion aggregation embedded with a graph convolutional
   network (NMA-GCN) is proposed for skeleton-based human action
   recognition. Based on the skeleton quality and motion-salient regions,
   NMA is able to focus on the discriminative motion information of human
   motion-salient regions. Finally, the aggregated skeleton sequences are
   embedded with the GCN backbone for skeleton-based human action
   recognition. Experiments were conducted on three large benchmarks: NTU
   RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and FineGym. The results show that our method
   achieves 93.4% (Xsub) and 98.2% (Xview) on NTU RGB+D dataset, 87.0%
   (Xsub) and 90.0% (Xset) on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, and 90.3% on
   FineGym dataset. Ablation studies and evaluations across various
   GCN-based backbones further support the effectiveness and generalization
   of NMA-GCN.

AB Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically predict the
   sentiment polarity of the written text based on the analysis of specific
   aspects. By applying various pre-trained language encoders, recent
   studies have achieved great success in modeling aspect and context
   features and measuring the word-level correlations. However, the
   pre-trained language models (PLM) were usually employed as the feature
   representations generator without any task-oriented guidance. And the
   syntax dependency tree is also not fully utilized. Besides, simply
   concatenating usually fails to exploit deep semantic features from
   multi-source spaces and weakens the representation of context features.
   In this study, we propose a novel model, namely PRoGCN (Prompted RoBERTa
   & Graph Convolution Network), which directly tells RoBERTa the goal of
   the present task by inserting the task-oriented specific prompting word
   to the raw text. Moreover, the prompted feature representation is also
   utilized to help generate textual knowledge graph, and strongly enhances
   the syntactic feature representation. In addition, we first introduce
   cross attention into our study to integrate semantic representation and
   syntactic representation, which has been proven to be successful in
   implementing and fusing multi-source information. Experimental results
   on five publicly available ABSA datasets validate the effectiveness of
   our method, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
   performance on mentioned ABSA benchmarks.

AB Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild is challenging due to
   various unconstrained conditions, i.e., occlusions and head pose
   variations. Previous methods tend to improve the performance of facial
   expression recognition through resorting to holistic methods or coarse
   local-based methods, while ignoring the local fine-grained feature
   structure knowledge and the correlation between features. In this paper,
   we propose a Fine-Grained Association Graph Representation (FG-AGR)
   framework which can capture the local fine-grained facial expression
   representation. Firstly, an Adaptive Salient Region Induction (ASRI) is
   designed for adaptively highlighting the local saliency regions of
   facial expressions combined with spatial location information. Based on
   this, a Local Fine-grained Feature Extraction (LFFE) based on Visual
   Transformers is introduced to further extract fine but discriminative
   fine-grained features of saliency regions. Thirdly, an Adaptive Graph
   Association Reasoning (AGAR) based on Graph Convolutional Network is
   constructed to learn associated fine-grained feature combinations.
   Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FG-AGR achieves superior
   performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods with 90.81% on
   RAF-DB, 64.91% on AffectNet-7, 60.69% on AffectNet-8 and 91.09% on
   FERPlus.

AB Human motion recognition is of great value in the fields of intelligent
   monitoring systems, driver assistance system, advanced human-computer
   interaction, human motion analysis, image and video processing. However,
   the current human motion recognition methods have the problem of poor
   recognition effect. Therefore, we propose a human motion recognition
   method based on Nano complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
   image sensor. First, using the Nano-CMOS image sensor to transform and
   process the human motion image, and combines the background mixed model
   of pixels in the human motion image to extract the human motion
   features, and feature selection is conducted. Second, according to the
   three-dimensional scanning features of Nano-CMOS image sensor, the human
   joint coordinate information data is collected, the state variables of
   human motion are sensed by the sensor, and the human motion model is
   constructed according to the measurement matrix of human motions.
   Finally, the foreground features of human motion images are obtained by
   calculating the feature parameters of each motion gesture. According to
   the posterior conditional probability of human motion images, the
   recognition objective function of human motion is obtained to realize
   human motion recognition. The results show that the human motion
   recognition effect of the proposed method is good, the extraction
   accuracy is high, the average human motion recognition rate is 92%, the
   classification accuracy is high, and the recognition speed is up to 186
   frames/s.

AB Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) aims to reduce the areas for
   searching of mineral deposits. Various statistical models that have been
   successfully adopted to delineate prospecting regions for a specific
   type of mineral deposit can be divided into pixel-wise, image- (or
   pixel-patch), and graph-based approaches. The pixel-wise models, which
   frequently integrate multiple prospecting information (or evidence
   layers) at a single pixel, do not adequately consider the spatial
   associations among neighboring pixels and may ignore the spatial
   patterns linked to mineralization or the spatial distribution
   characteristics of mineral deposits to some extent. Image-based models
   such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract local
   meaningful features and capture the spatial patterns of prospecting
   information in MPM because the input data of image-based models are
   images composed of regular pixels in the Euclidean space. However, CNNs
   also have limitations in MPM, such as the requirement for regular input
   data and non-rotationally invariant spatial features. Graphs that are
   typically composed of nodes and edges have a strong abstraction to
   capture the complex and nonlinear spatial relationships among multiple
   nodes and their edges. Prospecting information or evidence layers can be
   regarded as graphs in which pixels are connected by their adjacent
   pixels. In this study, graph deep learning algorithms, including graph
   convolutional networks and graph attention networks, were employed to
   produce mineral potential maps. A comparative study of graph deep
   learning algorithms with a CNN demonstrated the advantage of graph deep
   learning algorithms for MPM in terms of the cumulative areas versus the
   cumulative number of mineral deposits and the true/false prediction rate
   plot. These results suggest that the graph-based models, such as graph
   neutral networks, can effectively capture mineralization information and
   the spatial interrelations between mineralization and prospecting
   information.

AB Traffic speed prediction plays an important role in intelligent
   transportation systems, and many approaches have been proposed over
   recent decades. In recent years, methods using graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) have been more promising, which can extract the
   spatiality of traffic networks and achieve a better prediction
   performance than others. However, these methods only use inaccurate
   historical data of traffic speed to forecast, which decreases the
   prediction accuracy to a certain degree. Moreover, they ignore the
   influence of dynamic traffic on spatial relationships and merely
   consider the static spatial dependency. In this paper, we present a
   novel graph convolutional network model called FSTGCN to solve these
   problems, where the model adopts the full convolutional structure and
   avoids repeated iterations. Specifically, because traffic flow has a
   mapping relationship with traffic speed and its values are more exact,
   we fused historical traffic flow data into the forecasting model in
   order to reduce the prediction error. Meanwhile, we analyzed the
   covariance relationship of the traffic flow between road segments and
   designed the dynamic adjacency matrix, which can capture the dynamic
   spatial correlation of the traffic network. Lastly, we conducted
   experiments on two real-world datasets and prove that our model can
   outperform state-of-the-art traffic speed prediction.

AB Classification of electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI-EEG)
   tasks is crucial in brain computer interfaces (BCI). In view of the
   characteristics of non-stationarity, time-variability and individual
   diversity of EEG signals, a novel framework based on graph neural
   network is proposed for MI-EEG classification. First, an adaptive graph
   convolutional layer (AGCL) is constructed, by which the electrode
   channel information are integrated dynamically. We further propose an
   adaptive spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN), which
   fully exploits the characteristics of EEG signals in time domain and the
   channel correlations in spatial domain simultaneously. We execute the
   experiments using EEG signals recorded at motor imagery scenarios, where
   twenty-five healthy subjects performed MI movements of the right hand
   and feet to generate motor commands. Experimental results reveal that
   the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
   both classification quality and robustness. The advantages of ASTGCN
   include high accuracy, high efficiency, and robustness to cross-trial
   and cross-subject variations, making it an ideal candidate for long-term
   MI-EEG applications.

AB In subtropical regions, heavy rains from cumulonimbus clouds can cause
   disasters such as flash floods and mudslides. The accurate prediction of
   cumulonimbus cloud distribution is crucial for mitigating such losses.
   Traditional machine learning approaches have been used on radar echo
   data generated by constant altitude plan position indicator (CAPPI)
   radar systems for predicting cumulonimbus cloud distribution. However,
   the results are often too foggy and fuzzy. This paper proposes a novel
   approach that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) and
   trajectory gated recurrent units (TrajGRU) with an attention mechanism
   to predict cumulonimbus cloud distribution from radar echo data.
   Experiments were conducted using the moving modified National Institute
   of Standards and Technology (moving MNIST) dataset and real-world radar
   echo data, and the proposed model showed a 59.12% improvement in mean
   square error (MSE) and a 16.26% improvement in structure similarity
   index measure (SSIM) on average in the moving MNIST dataset, a 65.40%
   improvement in MSE, and an 10.29% improvement in SSIM on average in the
   radar echo dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach for improving the prediction accuracy of cumulonimbus
   cloud distribution.

AB This research proposed a data analysis framework applying human action
   recognition (HAR) with filtering processing to recognize human workers'
   actions and further calculate the operating time of each action. When
   applying HAR to recognize the worker's operation actions on a
   manufacturing site, the repeated and reciprocating actions easily cause
   misrecognition. Without the separation of actions in advance, the
   evaluation of HAR in real-world manufacturing is different from the
   evaluation based on the open data in the literature. To resolve the
   practical issues of applying HAR on a manufacturing site, first, the
   spatial-temporal skeleton coordinates of human joints were generated as
   the input of the skeleton-based spatial-temporal graph convolutional
   neural network (ST-GCN) for training the recognition model. Once the
   human action is recognized in each frame, the filtering processing
   considering the reference correction and accumulative moving mode (AMM)
   was proposed to improve the recognition accuracy. The real-world case
   study of the forging industry was conducted, and the empirical result
   shows the proposed framework was able to detect human workers' repeated
   actions with 89% accuracy. Also, the time analysis based on HAR-Time
   recognition can correctly detect the associated time features that have
   highly correlated to the low quality of the product.

AB Automatic sleep staging is important for improving diagnosis and
   treatment, and machine learning with neuroscience explainability of
   sleep staging is shown to be a suitable method to solve this problem. In
   this paper, an explainable model for automatic sleep staging is
   proposed. Inspired by the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), an
   adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is established to extract
   features from the Polysomnography (PSG) signal, named STDP-GCN. In
   detail, the channel of the PSG signal can be regarded as a neuron, the
   synapse strength between neurons can be constructed by the STDP
   mechanism, and the connection between different channels of the PSG
   signal constitutes a graph structure. After utilizing GCN to extract
   spatial features, temporal convolution is used to extract transition
   rules between sleep stages, and a fully connected neural network is used
   for classification. To enhance the strength of the model and minimize
   the effect of individual physiological signal discrepancies on
   classification accuracy, STDP-GCN utilizes domain adversarial training.
   Experiments demonstrate that the performance of STDP-GCN is comparable
   to the current state-of-the-art models.

AB This article tackles Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) where the target
   label set is a subset of the source label set. A key challenging issue
   in PDA is to prevent negative transfer by isolating source-private
   classes. Since there is no label information for a target domain, PDA
   methods require to estimate a label commonness score between source and
   target domains. Existing approaches use either class-level or
   sample-level commonness to alleviate the negative transfer issue.
   However, class-level methods assign the same label commonness to all
   samples of the same class without considering each sample's
   characteristics. Also, the recently introduced sample-level approaches
   show better performance but they still suffer from negative transfer due
   to non-trivial anomaly samples. To address these limitations, we propose
   Adaptive Graph Adversarial Networks (AGAN) consisting of two specialized
   modules. The adaptive class-relational graph module is designed to
   utilize the intra- and inter-domain structures through adaptive feature
   propagation. Complementarily, the sample-level commonness predictor
   computes a commonness score of each sample. Extensive experimental
   results on public PDA benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
   structure-aware method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB A spammer sends many useless advertisements to recipients via social
   networking sites without their permission, posing a serious threat to
   the information security of regular users, as well as the credit system
   of these sites. A social network Spammer detection technology based on
   graph convolution networks (GCNs) is presented with the goal of
   addressing the shortcomings of existing social network Spammer detection
   technologies, such as their shallow feature extraction and excessive
   computational complexity. With the help of an introduction of a network
   representation learning algorithm, this method extracts the local
   structural features of the network and then combines the GCN algorithm
   with renormalization technology to obtain the global structural features
   of the network, which can be used to detect spam. Experiments conducted
   on data from the social networking site demonstrate that the proposed
   method has good accuracy and efficiency.

AB Objective. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative
   dementia that poses a significant global health threat. It is imperative
   and essential to detect patients in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   stage or even earlier, enabling effective interventions to prevent
   further deterioration of dementia. This study focuses on the early
   prediction of dementia utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data,
   using the proposed Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Approach.
   Specifically, we developed a functional connectivity (FC) based GCN
   framework for binary classifications using resting-state fMRI data. We
   explored different types and processing methods of FC and evaluated the
   performance on the OASIS-3 dataset. We developed the GCN model for two
   different purposes: (1) MCI diagnosis: classifying MCI from normal
   controls (NCs); and (2) dementia risk prediction: classifying NCs from
   subjects who have the potential for developing MCI but have not been
   clinically diagnosed as MCI. Main results. The results of the
   experiments revealed several important findings: First, the proposed GCN
   outperformed both the baseline GCN and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It
   achieved the best average accuracy of 80.3% (11.7% higher than the
   baseline GCN and 23.5% higher than SVM) and the highest accuracy of
   91.2%. Secondly, the GCN framework with (absolute) individual FC
   performed slightly better than that with global FC generally. However,
   GCN using global graphs with appropriate connectivity can achieve
   equivalent or superior performance to individual graphs in some cases,
   which highlights the significance of suitable connectivity for achieving
   performance. Additionally, the results indicate that the self-network
   connectivity of specific brain network regions (such as default mode
   network, visual network, ventral attention network and somatomotor
   network) may play a more significant role in GCN classification.
   Significance. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the
   application of GCNs in brain analysis and early diagnosis of dementia.
   This contributes significantly to the understanding of MCI and has
   substantial potential for clinical applications in early diagnosis and
   intervention for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Our code
   for GCN implementation is available at:

AB Background: The major intrinsic protein (MIP) family is a family of
   proteins, including aquaporins, which facilitate water and small
   molecule transport across plasma membranes. In plants, MIPs function in
   a huge variety of processes including water transport, growth, stress
   response, and fruit development. In this study, we characterize the
   structure and transcriptional regulation of the MIP family in grapevine,
   describing the putative genome duplication events leading to the family
   structure and characterizing the family's tissue and developmental
   specific expression patterns across numerous preexisting microarray and
   RNAseq datasets. Gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses were carried
   out across these datasets and the promoters of each family member were
   analyzed for cis-regulatory element structure in order to provide
   insight into their transcriptional regulation.
   Results: A total of 29 Vitis vinifera MIP family members (excluding
   putative pseudogenes) were identified of which all but two were mapped
   onto Vitis vinifera chromosomes. In this study, segmental duplication
   events were identified for five plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP)
   and four tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) genes, contributing to the
   expansion of PIPs and TIPs in grapevine. Grapevine MIP family members
   have distinct tissue and developmental expression patterns and
   hierarchical clustering revealed two primary groups regardless of the
   datasets analyzed. Composite microarray and RNA-seq gene co-expression
   networks (GCNs) highlighted the relationships between MIP genes and
   functional categories involved in cell wall modification and transport,
   as well as with other MIPs revealing a strong co-regulation within the
   family itself. Some duplicated MIP family members have undergone
   sub-functionalization and exhibit distinct expression patterns and GCNs.
   Cis-regulatory element (CRE) analyses of the MIP promoters and their
   associated GCN members revealed enrichment for numerous CREs including
   AP2/ERFs and NACs.
   Conclusions: Combining phylogenetic analyses, gene expression profiling,
   gene co-expression network analyses, and cis-regulatory element
   enrichment, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the
   structure and transcriptional regulation of the grapevine MIP family.
   The study highlights the duplication and sub-functionalization of the
   family, its strong coordinated expression with genes involved in growth
   and transport, and the putative classes of TFs responsible for its
   regulation.

AB Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs
   are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a
   potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring
   out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role
   in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of
   individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of
   miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and
   time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on
   revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model
   integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was
   constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The
   model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph
   including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different
   effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the
   different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on
   miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of
   miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for
   the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and
   excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of
   each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the
   attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of
   miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against
   other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and
   an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the
   finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on
   most of the performance evaluation indexes.
   Author summary Identifying miRNA-disease associations accelerates the
   understanding towards pathogenicity, which is beneficial for the
   development of treatment tools for diseases. Different from existing
   methods, our GCSENet captures the deep relationship between miRNA and
   disease through three heterogeneous graphs (disease, gene and miRNA) to
   promote an accurate prediction result. We performed the 10-fold cross
   validation to evaluate the performance of GCSENet, which can outperform
   many classic methods. Furthermore, we carried out case studies on four
   important diseases, which were used to evaluate the performance of our
   model regarding to the associations with experimental evidences in
   literature. The result shows that most predicted miRNAs (48 for lung
   neoplasms, 48 for heart failure, 48 for breast cancer and 50 for
   glioblastoma) in the top 50 predictions were confirmed in HMDD v3.0. As
   a result, it shows that GCSENet can make reliable predictions and guide
   experiments to uncover more miRNA-disease associations.

AB With the growing popularity of somatosensory interaction devices, human
   action recognition is becoming attractive in many application scenarios.
   Skeleton-based action recognition is effective because the skeleton can
   represent the position and the structure of key points of the human
   body. In this paper, we leverage spatiotemporal vectors between skeleton
   sequences as input feature representation of the network, which is more
   sensitive to changes of the human skeleton compared with representations
   based on distance and angle features. In addition, we redesign residual
   blocks that have different strides in the depth of the network to
   improve the processing ability of the temporal convolutional networks
   (TCNs) for long time dependent actions. In this work, we propose the
   two-stream temporal convolutional networks (TS-TCNs) that take full
   advantage of the inter-frame vector feature and the intra-frame vector
   feature of skeleton sequences in the spatiotemporal representations. The
   framework can integrate different feature representations of skeleton
   sequences so that the two feature representations can make up for each
   other's shortcomings. The fusion loss function is used to supervise the
   training parameters of the two branch networks. Experiments on public
   datasets show that our network achieves superior performance and attains
   an improvement of 1.2% over the recent GCN-based (BGC-LSTM) method on
   the NTU RGB+D dataset.

AB In recent years, the pollution of organic wastewater to the environment
   has attracted extensive attention. The adsorption method is simple and
   has been used for the adsorption of organic dyes in wastewater. In this
   study, lithium chloride (LiCl) was intercalated on graphite like carbon
   nitride (g-C3N4), a series of Li intercalated g-C3N4 adsorbents
   (Li/GCN-x) were synthesized. And use X-ray diffraction (XRD), field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption
   and other methods to comprehensively test and characterize the phase
   structure, morphology, and surface area of the prepared samples. At the
   same time, the influence of the amount of LiCl added on the adsorption
   of methylene blue (MB) on the intercalation material at room temperature
   was investigated. The optimal Li content in the intercalation g-C3N4 was
   determined. The research results show that compared with pure g-C3N4,
   the prepared Li/GCN-5 can form fibers with uniform diameters between the
   layers, XRD results show that the addition of LiCl makes the lattice of
   g-C3N4 expand and the layer spacing expand, indicating the successful
   intercalation of LiCl. The pH and the binding time between the adsorbent
   and MB were studied. The new functional groups of the adsorbent can form
   hydrogen bonds with MB molecules and interact through pi-pi bonds. When
   only 50 mg of the adsorbent is added, the maximum adsorption capacity
   can reach 704 mg.g(-1) in 5 min. In addition, adsorption kinetics
   simulations have been carried out. The results show that the
   intercalation adsorbent can adsorb MB. The model conforms to the
   quasi-second-order kinetic equation. The Weber-Morris model was further
   used to explore the adsorption control process. The results showed that
   the adsorption of MB was caused by the combined action of surface
   diffusion and intrapore diffusion, in which surface diffusion was
   dominant, and the newly added functional groups could form hydrogen
   bonds with MB molecules, and the interaction enhances the adsorption
   capacity through pi-pi bonds. The as-prepared materials in this study
   are stable, uniform and have large specific surface area, which can
   simply and quickly realize the adsorption of MB. It provides a simple,
   low-cost, and efficient method for the adsorption and removal of organic
   pollutants, which overcomes the shortcomings of slow kinetics of
   commonly used adsorbents.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) is a compromising catalyst material with a
   two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms having sp2 hybridization bonded in
   a hexagonal lattice structure. The gCN is a member of 2D-structured
   metal-free carbon materials. In this study, GO, gCN, fluorine, and
   nitrogen treated GO and ZnO-Ag (Ag doped ZnO) loaded carbon
   nanocomposites were studied. Fluorine and nitrogen treated GO is an
   up-rising carbon member. It has high stability. Its layer structure
   possess unique properties due to its C-F (covalent and semi-ionic) and
   C-N bonds. The computer simulations of all molecules were conducted
   using the Hartree-Fock function with a 6-311 G* mode on Spartan'14
   software. A number of properties like molecule structure, electrostatic
   potential, local ionization potential, density, HOMO, and LUMO level of
   the molecules were obtained from computer simula-tions. Electrochemical
   CO2 reduction to CH3OH on catalysts was investigated in different
   electrolysis conditions, such as different electrolytes with UV-light
   and 0.07 T magnetic core treatment. Results showed that the introduction
   of ZnO-Ag on carbon nanocomposites improved properties of carbon
   nanocomposites, leading to a high conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. Methanol
   production rate was improved by five-times after UV-light (lambda = 254
   nm) and 0.07 T magnetic core treatment. Faradaic efficiencies of carbon
   nanocomposites for methanol pro-duction through electrochemical
   reduction of CO2 in bicarbonate buffer and electrolytes were found to be
   67.48% and 58.93% (compared to Ag/AgCl) at -2.7 V, respectively. Charge
   carrier properties and morphology profile of these nanocomposites were
   also analyzed.

AB Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) is one of the important
   subtasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis, it aims at detecting the
   aspect terms, opinion terms, and the corresponding sentiment polarity,
   simultaneously. Most methods directly employ GCNs to capture the
   syntactic dependency information in ASTE. However, these methods may
   lead to error propagation. Besides, the GCN-based methods are weak at
   capturing sequence information and long-distance information. The
   general neural networks such as LSTM are good at capturing this kind of
   information. However, these general neural networks are weak at modeling
   syntactic dependency information. To alleviate the above problems, we
   propose a novel interactive dual channel network (IDCN) for ASTE. In
   IDCN, an interactive word pair generating (IWPG) module is designed to
   model the sequence information, long-distance dependency information,
   and correlation relations between word pairs, simultaneously. In the
   IWPG module, the dual channels can learn different representations.
   Based on these representations, the informative word-pair
   representations can be learned by the interaction mechanism of dual
   channels. Besides, we design the syntactic dependency fusion module to
   model the syntax dependency information by constructing word pair
   dependency relation tensors and pooling mechanism, which can naturally
   inject the syntactic dependency knowledge into the general neural
   networks and reduce error propagation. Abundant experiments have been
   performed on multiple datasets. The experimental results show that IDCN
   acquires state-of-the-art results and validates the effectiveness of
   IDCN.

AB Exosomal miRNAs activates hepatic stellate cell (HSC) and promote
   fibrosis. miR-222 was found to be increased in hepatitis B virus
   (HBV)-infected hepatocytes, and ferroptosis was reported to ameliorate
   liver fibrosis (LF). Although miR-222 and ferroptosis have been
   implicated in LF, the association between miR-222 and ferroptosis and
   how they coordinate to regulate LF are still not explicit. This study
   investigates the roles of miR-222 and transferrin receptor (TFRC) in LF.
   Lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was analyzed by flow
   cytometry. FerroOrange staining was used to measure intracellular iron
   level. Luciferase reporter assay was adopted to confirm the binding of
   miR-222 and TFRC. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblots were
   applied to analyze gene and protein expression. The results showed that
   supplementation of exosomes derived from HBV-infected LO2 cells
   remarkably enhanced LX-2 cell activation, evidenced by elevated
   hydroxyprolin (Hyp) secretion and alpha-SMA and COL1A2 expression.
   miR-222 was significantly increased in HBV-Exo. Overexpressing miR-222
   upregulated cell viability, secretion of Hpy, and expression of
   alpha-SMA and COL1A2, which were all blocked by overexpression of TFRC.
   Further study showed that TFRC was a target of miR-222, and miR-222
   promoted LX-2 cell activation through suppressing TFRC-induced
   ferroptosis in LX-2 cells. Exosomal miR-222 derived from HBV-infected
   hepatocytes promoted LF through inhibiting TFRC and TFRC-induced
   ferroptosis. This study emphasizes the significance of miR-222/TFRC axis
   in LF and suggests new insights in clinical decision making while
   treating LF.

AB Most ground-based remote sensing cloud classification methods focus on
   learning representation features for cloud images while ignoring the
   correlations among cloud images. Recently, graph convolutional network
   (GCN) is applied to provide the correlations for ground-based remote
   sensing cloud classification, in which the graph convolutional layer
   aggregates information from the connected nodes of graph in a weighted
   way. However, the weights assigned by GCN cannot reflect the importance
   of connected nodes precisely, which declines the discrimination of the
   aggregated features (AFs). To overcome the limitation, in this article,
   we propose the context graph attention network (CGAT) for ground-based
   remote sensing cloud classification. Specifically, the context graph
   attention layer (CGA layer) of CGAT is proposed to learn the context
   attention coefficients (CACs) and obtain the AFs of nodes based on the
   CACs. We compute the CACs not only considering the two connected nodes
   but also their neighborhood nodes in order to stabilize the aggregation
   process. In addition, we propose to utilize two different transformation
   matrices to transform the node and its connected nodes into new feature
   spaces, which could enhance the discrimination of AFs. We concatenate
   the AFs with the deep features (DFs) as final representations for cloud
   classification. Since existing ground-based cloud data sets (GCDs) have
   limited cloud images, we release a new data set named GCD that is the
   largest one for ground-based cloud classification. We conduct a series
   of experiments on GCD, and the experimental results verify the
   effectiveness of CGAT.

AB Novel object grasping is an important technology for robot manipulation
   in unstructured environments. For most of current works, a grasp
   sampling process is required to obtain grasp candidates, combined with a
   local feature extractor using deep learning. However, this pipeline is
   time-cost, especially when grasp points are sparse such as at the edge
   of a bowl. To tackle this problem, our algorithm takes the whole sparse
   point clouds as the input and requires no sampling or search process.
   Our work is combined with two steps. The first step is to predict poses,
   categories and scores (qualities) based on a SPH3D-GCN network. The
   second step is an iterative grasp pose refinement, which is to refine
   the best grasp generated in the first step. The whole weight sizes for
   these two steps are only about 0.81M and 0.52M, which takes about 73 ms
   for a whole prediction process including an iterative grasp pose
   refinement using a GeForce 840M GPU. Moreover, to generate training data
   of multi-object scene, a single-object dataset (79 objects from YCB
   object set, 23.7k grasps) and a multi-object dataset (20k point clouds
   with annotations and masks) combined with thin structures grasp planning
   are generated. Our experiment shows our work gets 76.67% success rate
   and 94.44% completion rate, which performs better than current
   state-of-the-art works.

AB Truth discovery methods aim to identify which piece of information is
   trustworthy from multi-sourced data. Most existing truth discovery
   methods, however, are designed for structured data and fail to meet the
   strong need to extract trustworthy information from raw text data. More
   specifically, existing methods ignore the semantic information of text
   answers, i.e., answers may contain multiple factors, the word usages may
   be diverse, and the answers may be partially correct. In addition,
   ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon exists in the tasks, i.e., most users
   provide only a few answers and only a few users provide plenty of
   answers, which causes the user reliability estimation for small users to
   be unreasonable. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) based truth discovery model to automatically
   discover trustworthy information from text data. Firstly, Smooth Inverse
   Frequency (SIF) is utilized to learn real-valued vector representations
   for answers. Then, we construct undirected graph with these vectors to
   capture the structural information of answers. Finally, the GCN is
   utilized to store and update the reliability of these answers, and sums
   up all the feature vectors of all neighboring answers to improve the
   accuracy and efficiency of truth discovery. Different from traditional
   methods, we use vectors to store the reliability of answers which have
   higher representation capability compared with real numbers, and network
   is utilized to capture complex relationships among answers rather than
   simplified functions. The experiment results on real datasets show that
   though text data structures are complex, our model can still find
   reliable answers compared with retrieval-based and state-of-the-art
   truth discovery methods.

AB Evolutionary theories of ageing predict a reduction in selection
   efficiency with age, a so-called "selection shadow," due to extrinsic
   mortality decreasing effective population size with age. Classic
   symptoms of ageing include a deterioration in transcriptional regulation
   and protein homeostasis. Understanding how ant queens defy the trade-off
   between fecundity and lifespan remains a major challenge for the
   evolutionary theory of ageing. It has often been discussed that the low
   extrinsic mortality of ant queens, that are generally well protected
   within the nest by workers and soldiers, should reduce the selection
   shadow acting on old queens. We tested this by comparing strength of
   selection acting on genes upregulated in young and old queens of the
   ant, Cardiocondyla obscurior. In support of a reduced selection shadow,
   we find old-biased genes to be under strong purifying selection. We also
   analyzed a gene coexpression network (GCN) with the aim to detect signs
   of ageing in the form of deteriorating regulation and proteostasis. We
   find no evidence for ageing. In fact, we detect higher connectivity in
   old queens indicating increased transcriptional regulation with age.
   Within the GCN, we discover five highly correlated modules that are
   upregulated with age. These old-biased modules regulate several
   antiageing mechanisms such as maintenance of proteostasis,
   transcriptional regulation, and stress response. We observe stronger
   purifying selection on central hub genes of these old-biased modules
   compared with young-biased modules. These results indicate a lack of
   transcriptional ageing in old C. obscurior queens, possibly facilitated
   by strong selection at old age and well-regulated antiageing mechanisms.

AB Previous video action recognition mainly focuses on extracting spatial
   and temporal features from videos or capturing physical dependencies
   among joints. The relation between joints is often ignored. Modeling the
   relation between joints is important for action recognition. Aiming at
   learning discriminative relation between joints, this paper proposes a
   joint spatial-temporal reasoning (JSTR) framework to recognize action
   from videos. For the spatial representation, a joints spatial relation
   graph is built to capture position relations between joints. For the
   temporal representation, temporal information of body joints is modeled
   by the intra-joint temporal relation graph. The spatial reasoning
   feature and the temporal reasoning feature are fused to recognize action
   from videos. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in three
   real-world video action recognition datasets. The experiment results
   display good performance across all of these datasets.

AB In the past, most of the entity prediction methods based on embedding
   lacked the training of local core relationships, resulting in a
   deficiency in the end-to-end training. Aiming at this problem, we
   propose an end-to-end knowledge graph embedding representation method.
   It involves local graph convolution and global cross learning in this
   paper, which is called the TransC graph convolutional network
   (TransC-GCN). Firstly, multiple local semantic spaces are divided
   according to the largest neighbor. Secondly, a translation model is used
   to map the local entities and relationships into a cross vector, which
   serves as the input of GCN. Thirdly, through training and learning of
   local semantic relations, the best entities and strongest relations are
   found. The optimal entity relation combination ranking is obtained by
   evaluating the posterior loss function based on the mutual information
   entropy. Experiments show that this paper can obtain local entity
   feature information more accurately through the convolution operation of
   the lightweight convolutional neural network. Also, the maximum pooling
   operation helps to grasp the strong signal on the local feature, thereby
   avoiding the globally redundant feature. Compared with the mainstream
   triad prediction baseline model, the proposed algorithm can effectively
   reduce the computational complexity while achieving strong robustness.
   It also increases the inference accuracy of entities and relations by
   8.1% and 4.4%, respectively. In short, this new method can not only
   effectively extract the local nodes and relationship features of the
   knowledge graph but also satisfy the requirements of multilayer
   penetration and relationship derivation of a knowledge graph.

AB Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has caught far-ranging concern for its
   masses of advan-tages, for instance, the unique graphite-like
   two-dimensional lamellar structure, low cost, nontoxic, suitable bandgap
   of 2.7 eV and favorable stability. Whereas owing to the short-comings of
   low solar absorptivity and fast recombination of photo-induced charge
   pairs, the overall quantum efficiency of photocatalysis for g-C3N4 is
   suboptimal, resulting in limited practicality of g-C3N4 (GCN). In our
   study, modified g-C3N4 materials (HCN) with ample carbon vacancies (CVs)
   were obtained through calcinating of g-C3N4 in H2 atmo-sphere. Higher
   specific surface area and more active sites of HCN were induced by
   roasting of g-C3N4 in H2. CVs that occurred in the N-(C3) bond lead to
   the reduction of electron density around N, thus narrowing the bandgap
   of HCN-3h and enlarging corresponding light response capability. Under
   the synergistic function of abundant pore construction and CVs on HCN,
   the photo-excited e -/h+ pairs can be memorably separated and
   trans-ferred, which is favorable to photocatalytic efficiency. Among
   HCN, the HCN-3h sample has the highest H2 generation rate of 4297.9 mmol
   h-1 g-1, which achieves 2.3-fold higher than that of GCN (1291.7 mmol
   h-1 g-1). This paper brings forward a meaningful method of boosting the
   photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts by constructing abundant

AB Real-time and reliable short-term traffic state prediction is one of the
   most critical technologies in intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
   However, the traffic state is generally perceived by single sensor in
   existing studies, which is difficult to satisfy the requirement of
   real-time prediction in complex traffic networks. In this paper, a
   short-term traffic prediction model based on complex neural network is
   proposed under the environment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
   communication systems. Firstly, a traffic perception system of
   multi-source sensors based on V2X communication is proposed and
   designed. A mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted architecture is then
   introduced in a V2X network to facilitate perceptual and computational
   abilities of the system. Moreover, the graph convolutional network
   (GCN), the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and the soft-attention mechanism
   are combined to extract spatiotemporal features of traffic state and
   integrate them for future prediction. Finally, an intelligent roadside
   test platform is demonstrated for perception and computation of
   real-time traffic state. The comparison experiments show that the
   proposed method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy by
   comparing with the existing neural network models, which consider one of
   the spatiotemporal features. In particular, for comparison results of
   the traffic state prediction and the error value of root mean squared
   error (RMSE) is reduced by 39.53%, which is the greatest reduction in
   error occurrences by comparing with the GCN and GRU models in 5, 10, 15
   and 30 min respectively.

AB Background Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of
   autoimmune diseases characterised by myositis-related autoantibodies
   plus infiltration of leucocytes into muscles and/or the skin, leading to
   the destruction of blood vessels and muscle fibres, chronic weakness and
   fatigue. While complement-mediated destruction of capillary endothelia
   is implicated in paediatric and adult dermatomyositis, the complex
   diversity of complement C4 in IIM pathology was unknown. Methods We
   elucidated the gene copy number (GCN) variations of total C4, C4A and
   C4B, long and short genes in 1644 Caucasian patients with IIM, plus 3526
   matched healthy controls using real-time PCR or Southern blot analyses.
   Plasma complement levels were determined by single radial
   immunodiffusion. Results The large study populations helped establish
   the distribution patterns of various C4 GCN groups. Low GCNs of C4T
   (C4T=2+3) and C4A deficiency (C4A=0+1) were strongly correlated with
   increased risk of IIM with OR equalled to 2.58 (2.28-2.91),
   p=5.0x10(-53) for C4T, and 2.82 (2.48-3.21), p=7.0x10(-57) for C4A
   deficiency. Contingency and regression analyses showed that among
   patients with C4A deficiency, the presence of HLA-DR3 became
   insignificant as a risk factor in IIM except for inclusion body myositis
   (IBM), by which 98.2% had HLA-DR3 with an OR of 11.02 (1.44-84.4).
   Intragroup analyses of patients with IIM for C4 protein levels and
   IIM-related autoantibodies showed that those with anti-Jo-1 or with
   anti-PM/Scl had significantly lower C4 plasma concentrations than those
   without these autoantibodies. Conclusions C4A deficiency is relevant in

AB A novel method for skeleton-based action recognition by fusing
   multi-level spatial features and multi-level temporal features is
   proposed in this article. Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   for skeleton-based action recognition has attracted the eyes of many
   researchers and has a great performance in the field of action
   recognition. But most of them focus on changing architecture of
   single-stream network and only use simple methods like average fusion to
   fuse different forms of skeleton data. In this article, we shift the
   focus to the problem that insufficient interactions between the
   different forms of features for that networks are unable to fully
   capture efficient information from skeleton data. To tackle this
   problem, we propose a multi-stream network called Symmetrical Enhanced
   Fusion Network (SEFN). The network is composed of a spatial stream, a
   temporal stream and a fusion stream. The spatial stream extracts spatial
   features from skeleton data by GCN. The temporal stream is able to
   extract temporal features from skeleton data with the help of the
   embedded Motion Sequence Calculation Algorithm. The fusion stream
   provides an early fusion method and extra fusion information for the
   whole network. It gathers multi-level features from two feature
   extractions and fuses them with the Multi-perspective Attention Fusion
   Module (MPAFM) we propose. The MPAFM enables different forms of data to
   enhance each other and can strengthen feature extractions. In the final,
   we generalize the skeleton data from joint data to bone data and
   evaluate our network in three large-scale benchmarks: NTU-RGBD, NTU-RGBD
   120 and Kinetics-Skeleton. Experiment results demonstrate that our
   method achieves competitive performance.

AB Extensive efforts have been applied to develop efficient feature
   extraction algorithms, which aim to achieve optimal results in many
   fundamental tasks such as Web-based software service clustering,
   recommendation and composition. However, one common issue for existing
   methods is that mined features are problem dependent, causing poor
   generalization ability across different applications. Recent studies
   show that we can represent networked data (e.g., citation networks and
   social networks) as low-dimensional vectors with rich structure and
   content information preserved, which can then greatly facilitate many
   downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. In this article,
   we focus on the problem of Web service network embedding, which aims to
   learn low-dimensional vectors to represent services by encoding both
   Mashup-API composition structure and service functional content. We
   first propose a novel probabilistic topic model to predict potential
   links between Mashups and APIs in the service network. Then, we develop
   a Service Graph Convolutional Network (Service-GCN) to learn vector
   representations of services, where each service (e.g., Mashup or API)
   forms its representation through message passing between neighborhood
   services over the network. We evaluate the network embedding quality on
   two real-world datasets for downstream classification and clustering
   tasks. Experimental results show that the average performance of our
   method improves 20.7 percent (Micro-F1) in service classification and
   19.0 percent (Accuracy) in Mashup clustering compared to the
   state-of-the-art, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach for learning vector representations of Web services.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been introduced to the routing and
   spectrum assignment (RSA) of elastic optical networks (EONs) where the
   RSA policies are learnt during the interaction of a DRL agent with the
   EON environment. Upon each new traffic arrival, the DRL agent senses the
   EON state, and makes the RSA decision accordingly. Therefore, the EON
   state feature extraction is essential for the performance. However,
   current approaches, mainly based on fully connected neural networks or
   convolutional neural networks, are unsatisfactory in EON state feature
   extraction due to the following two reasons. (1) The optical network
   topology information is not well considered. (2) The path-level features
   are highly related to the RSA decision, due to the spectrum continuity
   constraint, while path-level feature extraction has not been well
   exploited. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose
   to utilize the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) and the
   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the feature extraction of the network
   topology, and the aggregation of link-level features to path-level
   features. By doing this, critical RSA-related information can be sensed
   by the DRL agent to make better actions. Simulation results demonstrate
   that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches.

AB With the rapid development of neural networks, much attention has been
   focused on network embedding for complex network data, which aims to
   learn low-dimensional embedding of nodes in the network and how to
   effectively apply learned network representations to various graph-based
   analytical tasks. Two typical models exist namely the shallow random
   walk network representation method and deep learning models such as
   graph convolution networks (GCNs). The former one can be used to capture
   the linear structure of the network using depth-first search (DFS) and
   width-first search (BFS), whereas Hierarchical GCN (HGCN) is an
   unsupervised graph embedding that can be used to describe the global
   nonlinear structure of the network via aggregating node information.
   However, the two existing kinds of models cannot simultaneously capture
   the nonlinear and linear structure information of nodes. Thus, the nodal
   characteristics of nonlinear and linear structures are explored in this
   paper, and an unsupervised representation method based on HGCN that
   joins learning of shallow and deep models is proposed. Experiments on
   node classification and dimension reduction visualization are carried
   out on citation, language, and traffic networks. The results show that,
   compared with the existing shallow network representation model and deep
   network model, the proposed model achieves better performances in terms
   of micro-F1, macro-F1 and accuracy scores.

AB Recognizing traffic command gestures with high accuracy and quick
   response at a low computational cost is a requisite for driver
   assistance or autonomous driving. However, it has been understudied for
   a long time. Existing research takes advantage of increasing development
   in human action recognition but pays little attention to onboard
   conditions. In this article, we propose a simple but effective
   recognition model based on human upper-body geometric features and a
   long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The handcrafted geometric
   features can easily be calculated with estimated 2-D human keypoints at
   a low computational cost but are discriminative and sufficient in
   classification. Offline and online inferences are implemented to
   comprehensively evaluate the proposed model. For the sake of robustness
   required in the automotive domain, dual voting is designed to filter the
   output in online inference. On the recently published Chinese traffic
   police gesture (CTPG) dataset, the presented approach is the best with a
   remarkable improvement of approximately 8% compared to previous
   LSTM-based methods with handcrafted spatial features and is competitive
   with advanced GCN-based deep learning methods. The tradeoff pattern is
   explored to demonstrate how accuracy and response time alter with
   different training and inference strategies so that a balanced setup can
   be manually chosen under various application scenarios. Field tests are
   also carried out with an experimental vehicle, and the results uncover
   the present gap between research and practical application to some
   extent, moving a step closer to real-life traffic command gesture
   recognition.

AB PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) family is a crucial DNA repair enzyme
   that responds to DNA damage, regulates apoptosis, and maintains genome
   stability; therefore, PARP inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic
   strategy for the treatment of various human diseases including COVID-19.
   In this study, a multi-task FP-GNN (Fingerprint and Graph Neural
   Networks) deep learning framework was proposed to predict the inhibitory
   activity of molecules against four PARP isoforms (PARP-1, PARP-2,
   PARP-5A, and PARP-5B). Compared with baseline predictive models based on
   four conventional machine learning methods such as RF, SVM, XGBoost, and
   LR as well as six deep learning algorithms such as DNN, Attentive FP,
   MPNN, GAT, GCN, and D-MPNN, the evaluation results indicate that the
   multi-task FP-GNN method achieves the best performance with the highest
   average BA, F1, and AUC values of 0.753 +/- 0.033, 0.910 +/- 0.045, and
   0.888 +/- 0.016 for the test set. In addition, Y-scrambling testing
   successfully verified that the model was not results of chance
   correlation. More importantly, the interpretability of the multi-task
   FP-GNN model enabled the identification of key structural fragments
   associated with the inhibition of each PARP isoform. To facilitate the
   use of the multi-task FP-GNN model in the field, an online webserver
   called PARPi-Predict and its local version software were created to
   predict whether compounds bear potential inhibitory activity against
   PARPs, thereby contributing to design and discover better selective PARP
   inhibitors.

AB View graph construction aims to effectively organise disordered image
   dataset through image retrieval technique before structure from motion
   (SfM). Existing view graph construction methods usually fail to handle
   scenes with duplicate structure, because these methods solely treat the
   construction of view graph as a process of image-pair-wise matching and
   lack in exploiting images' topological details in dataset. In this
   paper, we handle this problem from a novel perspective to construct view
   graph in a global paradigm by introducing an end-to-end graph
   convolutional network (GCN). First, a location-aware embedding module is
   introduced to encode images into a feature space that takes into account
   the feature's location by using Vision Transformer architecture,
   improving the distinction between features of duplicate structure.
   Second, graph convolutional network that consists of topological
   relationship preserving module and feature metric learning module is
   proposed. Topological relationship preserving network is proposed to
   help nodes maintain their connected neighbourhood features. By merging
   the topological connected information into images' embedding, our method
   can process image matching in a global mode, thus improving the
   disambiguation ability for images with duplicate scenes. Then a feature
   metric learning network is embedded into GCN to dynamically compute the
   linkage prediction among nodes based on their features. Finally, our
   method combines these three parts to jointly optimise nodes' features
   and linkage prediction in an end-to-end paradigm. We make qualitative
   and quantitative comparisons based on three public benchmark datasets
   and demonstrate that our proposed method performs favourably against
   other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recognizing surgical activities in endoscopic videos is of vital
   importance for developing context-aware decision support in the
   operating room. In this work, we model each surgical activity as an
   action triplet, consisting of the surgical instrument, the action, and
   the target organ that the instrument is interacting with. The goal is to
   recognize these action triplets from endoscopic videos. However,
   correctly recognizing fine-grained activity triplets is challenging
   because of the long-tail distribution of the triplet classes and the
   complex associations between triplets as well as within each triplet. In
   addition, multiple triplets may appear in a given video frame. To
   address these challenges, we propose a new model for surgical action
   triplet recognition based on a classification forest and Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN), which we call Forest GCN. The
   classification forest is employed to calibrate fine-grained triplet
   classifiers by the upstream parent classifiers to suppress noisy logits
   of the triplet classes in the long tail. And stacked GCNs are designed
   to model the dependencies between triplet classes while leveraging the
   language embedding. Experiments on the endoscopic video dataset,
   CholecT50, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current
   state-of-the-art methods on surgical action triplet recognition.

AB BACKGROUND: John Cunningham virus (JCV) is known to cause progressive
   multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immuno-compromised patients due
   to lytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Rarely, it may
   also present as granule cell neuronopathy (GCN), leading to degeneration
   of cerebellar granule cell neurons. It is described in patients with
   underlying conditions or medication contributing to immune compromise.
   Case Presentation. A 73-year-old man presented with ataxia and
   difficulty in speech which began 3 months after initiation of treatment
   for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with rituximab. Neurological
   examination was significant for torsional nystagmus, motor aphasia,
   right-sided dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia with gait ataxia. Magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) showed right cerebellar lesion and cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for JC virus.
   CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of JC virus-related cerebellar disease can be
   missed, due to the subacute to chronic onset and challenges in
   detection. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for
   development of these symptoms, even a few months after initiation of
   immune-modulatory therapy because the progression and outcomes can be
   disastrous.

AB Recently, a graph neural network (GNN) was proposed to analyze various
   graphs/networks, which has been proven to outperform many other network
   analysis methods. However, it is also shown that such state-of-the-art
   methods suffer from adversarial attacks, i.e., carefully crafted
   adversarial networks with slight perturbation on clean one may invalid
   these methods on lots of applications, such as network embedding, node
   classification, link prediction, and community detection. Adversarial
   training has been testified as an efficient defense strategy against
   adversarial attacks in computer vision and graph mining. However, almost
   all the algorithms based on adversarial training focus on global defense
   through overall adversarial training. In a more practical scene, certain
   users would be targeted to attack, i.e., specific labeled users. It is
   still a challenge to defend against target node attack by existing
   adversarial training methods. Therefore, we propose smoothing
   adversarial training (SAT) to improve the robustness of GNNs. In
   particular, we analytically investigate the robustness of graph
   convolutional network (GCN), one of the classic GNNs, and propose two
   smooth defensive strategies: smoothing distillation and smoothing
   cross-entropy loss function. Both of them smooth the gradients of GCN
   and, consequently, reduce the amplitude of adversarial gradients,
   benefiting gradient masking from attackers in both global attack and
   target label node attack. The comprehensive experiments on five
   real-world networks testify that the proposed SAT method shows
   state-of-the-art defensibility against different adversarial attacks on
   node classification and community detection. Especially, the average
   attack success rate of different attack methods can be decreased by
   about 40% by SAT at the cost of tolerable embedding performance decline
   of the original network.

AB GraphSAGE is a widely-used graph neural network for classification,
   which generates node embeddings in two steps: sampling and aggregation.
   In this paper, we introduce causal inference into the GraphSAGE sampling
   stage, and propose Causal GraphSAGE (C-GraphSAGE) to improve the
   robustness of the classifier. In C-GraphSAGE, we use causal
   bootstrapping to obtain a weighting between the target node's neighbors
   and their label. Then, these weights are used to resample the node's
   neighbors to enforce the robustness of the sampling stage. Finally, an
   aggregation function is trained to integrate the features of the
   selected neighbors to obtain the embedding of the target node.
   Experimental results on the Cora, Pubmed, and Citeseer citation datasets
   show that the classification performance of C-GraphSAGE is equivalent to
   that of GraphSAGE, GCN, GAT, and RL-GraphSAGE in the case of no
   perturbation, and outperforms these as the perturbation ratio increases.

AB Multi-step prediction of long-term traffic speed is an important part of
   the intelligent transportation system. Traffic speed is affected by
   temporal features, spatial features, and various environmental features.
   The prediction of traffic speed considering the above features is a big
   challenge. This study proposed a multi-step prediction model named
   embedding graph convolutional long short-term memory network (EGC-LSTM)
   for urban road network traffic speed prediction which can deal with
   spatial-temporal correlation and auxiliary features at the same time.
   Firstly, a graph convolutional network (GCN) for capturing directed
   graph properties is proposed. Based on the GCN, the LSTM and sequence to
   sequence model are further applied to realise multi-step prediction
   considering the spatial-temporal correlation of the traffic network. To
   improve the performance of the model and obtain the importance of each
   step in the historical data, the attention mechanism is introduced.
   Then, one-hot encoding is applied to the category-type auxiliary
   features. Considering that the dimension becomes larger after the
   features are one-hot encoded, the dimensions are reduced using
   embedding. The experiment results prove that the proposed model's
   performance is better than other models, and the model is interpreted in
   detail.

AB Analyzing the runtime behaviors of Android apps is crucial for malware
   detection. In this paper, we attempt to learn the behavior level
   features of an app from function calls. The challenges of this task are
   twofold. First, the absence of function attributes hinders the
   understanding of app behaviors. Second, the graphical representation of
   function calls cannot be directly processed by classical machine
   learning algorithms. In this paper, we develop two methods to overcome
   these challenges. Based on function embedding, we first propose the
   concept of enhanced function call graphs (E-FCGs) to characterize app
   runtime behaviors. We then develop a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   based algorithm to obtain vector representations of E-FCGs. Extensive
   experiments show that the features learned by our method can achieve
   surprisingly high detection performance on a variety of classifiers
   (e.g., LR, DT, SVM, KNN, RF, MLP and CNN), significantly outperforming
   the traditional static features. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Relation extraction is a crucial step in the constructions of knowledge
   graphs (KGs). However, relation extraction is performed manually in the
   manufacturing field due to the sentence characteristics, which include
   weak correlation and high entity density. This approach has the
   disadvantages of low efficiency and high dependence on experts. At
   present, very few studies have been performed on relation extraction in
   the manufacturing field, so establishing a relation extraction model
   with high efficiency is an urgent need. Therefore, in this paper, a
   relation extraction model is proposed for manufacturing knowledge
   (MKREM), in which word embedding is obtained by the Bi-LSTM layer to
   improve robustness, and a Simplified Graph Convolution Network (SGC)
   layer is applied to quickly mine the entity information. Then,
   dependency and semantic features are extracted by the multi-head stacked
   GCN and relation attention mechanism, respectively. Finally, the
   dependency and semantic features are fused to generate the comprehensive
   features for relation extraction so that better performance on texts
   with weak correlation and high entity density can be obtained. The
   performance of MKREM is tested by experiments on the equipment
   maintenance dataset and the quality dataset from an automobile
   enterprise, and its effectiveness is verified in the automobile
   manufacture filed. The results show that the F1 scores obtained using
   MKREM are 2% higher than those of the commonly used models on both
   datasets, and the F1 scores when using Contextualized-MKREM are improved
   by 3%, so MKREM is very suitable for the automatic relation extraction
   during establishing manufacturing KGs. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB A wide range of processes have been adopted for environmental
   remediation; among them, photocatalysis appeared as an appealing
   strategy for degradation of organic pollutants. Heterogeneous
   photocatalysis efficiently dissociates the charge carriers and helps in
   reducing the rapid recombination rate of charge carriers resulting in
   enhanced photocatalytic degradation. A semiconductor photocatalyst
   graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), when doped with metals or non-metals,
   showed increased degradation abilities. Hence, a ternary photocatalyst
   was synthesized by thermal condensation of urea coupled with ferric
   tungstate (FeWO4) and doped with a noble metal (Ag) resulting in visible
   light susceptive semiconductor photocatalyst Ag/FeWO4/g-C3N4. The
   characterization of the fabricated composite was done by Fourier
   transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive
   X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. The Ag/FWO/GCN was used to degrade the
   rhodamine B (RhB) dye. Under sunlight, Ag/FeWO4/g-C(3)N(4)showed
   enhanced photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B dye, which was
   ascribed to the change in bandgap and reduced charge recombination. The
   parameters used for the optimization of the photocatalyst were pH,
   catalyst dose, oxidant dose, and irradiation time. The composite
   (Ag/FeWO4/g-C3N4) showed similar to 98% degradation of RhB dye under
   optimized conditions (i.e., pH = 8, catalyst dose = 50 mg/100 ml,
   oxidant dose = 9 mM, irradiation time = 120 min and RhB conc. 50 ppm).

   reasoning for answering questions: recognizing specific relationship
   between two objects in the image, presenting the rationale of the
   answer. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network model,
   KG_VCR, for VCR problems. In addition to make use of visual relations
   and contextual information between objects extracted from input data
   (images, natural language questions, and response lists), the KG_VCR
   also utilizes commonsense knowledge embedding extracted from an external
   knowledge base called ConceptNet. Specifically the proposed model
   employs a Graph Convolutional Neural Network(GCN) module to obtain
   commonsense knowledge embedding from the retrieved ConceptNet knowledge
   graph. By conducting a series of experiments with the VCR benchmark
   dataset, we show that the proposed KG_VCR model outperforms both the
   state of the art(SOTA) VQA model and the R2C VCR model.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition methods using complete human skeletons
   have achieved remarkable performance, but the performance of these
   methods could significantly deteriorate when critical joints or frames
   of the skeleton sequence are occluded or disrupted. However, the
   acquisition of incomplete and noisy human skeletons is inevitable in
   realistic environments. In order to strengthen the robustness of action
   recognition model, we propose an Improved Spatial Temporal Graph
   Convolutional Network (IST-GCN) model, including three modules, namely
   Multi-dimension Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (Md-AGCN), Enhanced
   Attention Mechanism (EAM) and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network
   (MS-TCN). Specifically, the Md-AGCN module can first adaptively adjust
   the graph structure according to different layers and the spatial
   dimension, temporal dimension, and channel dimension of different action
   samples to establish corresponding connections for long-range joints
   with dependencies. Then, the EAM module can focus on important
   information based on spatial domain, temporal domain and channel to
   further strengthen the dependencies between important joints. Finally,
   the MS-TCN module is used to enlarge the receptive field to extract more
   latent temporal dependencies. The comprehensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D
   and NTU-RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that our approach possesses
   outstanding performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness when
   skeleton samples are incomplete and noisy compared with the
   state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Moreover, the parameters and
   computational complexity of our model are far less than those of the
   existing approaches.

   Methods Retrospective chart review of patients followed at the Saguenay
   Neuromuscular Clinic (Quebec, Canada).
   Results A total of 333 participants with the (GCN)(13) mutation were
   included. Before the age of 75 years, 27% of them had walking
   limitations, 14% could not climb stairs independently, and 14% used a
   wheelchair for long distances or daily living. The median age of onset
   was 54 years for ptosis and dysphagia and 58 years for lower limb
   proximal weakness. Other frequent symptoms included fatigue, pharyngeal
   pooling of thickened secretions, and dysphonia. The median age at death
   was 77 years and the main cause was respiratory disease.
   Discussion This study provides important information to help
   anticipatory guidance for affected people and for the development of
   therapeutic trials in OPMD.

   important role in social networks due to different kinds of malicious

   spamming results with fake accounts. In this paper, Deep Belief Neural

   detect anomalies from social networks. Particularly, the novel IAS
   algorithm is used for optimization of optimal hidden layers from DBN.
   The experimental details are obtained from both benchmark and real-time
   datasets. Experimentally, the DBN-IAS approach is compared with other
   existing methods such as GCN, RBM + SVM with SDN, and LAD. Finally, the
   DBN-IAS algorithm demonstrated optimal anomaly detection results from
   social networks and the proposed algorithm shows the detection rate of
   99.32%, which is far better than the existing approaches.

AB This paper presents a feature reasoning-based graph convolution network
   (FR-GCNet) to improve the classification accuracy of airborne
   multispectral LiDAR (MS-LiDAR) point clouds. In the FR-GCNet, we
   directly assign semantic labels to all points by exploring
   representative features both globally and locally. Based on the graph
   convolution network (GCN), a global reasoning unit is embedded to obtain
   the global contextual feature by revealing spatial relationships of
   points, while a local reasoning unit is integrated to dynamically learn
   edge features with attention weights in each local graph. Extensive
   experiments on the Titan MS-LiDAR data showed that the proposed FR-GCNet
   achieved a promising classification performance with an overall accuracy
   of 93.55%, an average F1-score of 78.61%, and a mean Intersection over
   Union (IoU) of 66.78%. Comparative experimental results demonstrated the
   superiority of the FR-GCNet against other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted significant attention from
   the chemical science community because molecules can be represented as a
   featured graph. In particular, graph convolutional network (GCN) and its
   variants have been widely used and have shown a state-of-the-art
   performance in analyzing molecules, such as molecular label
   classification, drug discovery, and molecular property prediction.
   However, in molecular analysis, existing GCNs have two fundamental
   limitations: (1) information of the molecular scale is distorted and (2)
   global structures in a molecule are ignored. These limitations can
   seriously degrade the performance in the machine learning-based
   molecular analysis because the scale and global structure information of
   a molecule occasionally have a significant effect on the molecular
   properties. To overcome the limitations of existing GCNs, we
   comprehensively analyzed the structure of GCNs and developed a costless
   solution for the limitations of GCNs. To demonstrate the effectiveness
   of our solution, extensive experiments were conducted on various
   benchmark datasets.

AB In the present work, mixed-spinel ferrite anchored onto graphitic carbon
   nitride (GCN) was synthesized for mineralization of antibiotic pollutant
   from waste water. A Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nano heterojunction
   was fabricated by three step procedure: pyrolysis, solution combustion
   and mechanical grinding followed by annealing. The prepared photocatlyst
   was tested for degradation of Doxycycline (DC) drug under the natural
   sun light. Results revealed that the prepared heterojunction has maximum
   degradation efficiency of 97.10% pollutant in 60 min experiment. The
   Z-scheme heterojunction between g-C3N4 and Ni-Zn ferrite improves the
   photoinduced charges separation and protection of redox capability and
   therby increases the photo degradation efficiency. The scavenging
   experiments suggested that O-2(-center dot) and h(+) as main active
   species responsible for degradation of the antibiotic. In addition, the
   dopant variation can drive the shists in band gap and energy band
   positiong too which makes then excellent candidates for synthesizing
   tunable heterostructures with organic semiconductors. The work focusses

AB Mycolactone is the exotoxin virulence factor of Mycobacterium ulcerans
   that causes the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. We recently
   showed it to be a broad spectrum inhibitor of Sec61-dependent
   co-translational translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER). An outstanding question is the molecular pathway linking
   this to its known cytotoxicity. We have now used translational profiling
   to better understand the reprogramming that occurs in cells exposed to
   mycolactone. Gene ontology identified enrichment in genes involved in
   cellular response to stress, and apoptosis signalling among those
   showing enhanced translation. Validation of these results supports a
   mechanism by which mycolactone activates an integrated stress response
   meditated by phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha via multiple kinases (PERK,
   GCN, PKR) without activation of the ER stress sensors IRE1 or ATF6. The
   response therefore uncouples the integrated stress response from ER
   stress, and features translational and transcriptional modes of genes
   expression that feature the key regulatory transcription factor ATF4.
   Emphasising the importance of this uncoupled response in cytotoxicity,
   downstream activation of this pathway is abolished in cells expressing
   mycolactone-resistant Sec61 alpha variants. Using multiple genetic and
   biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that eIF2 alpha phosphorylation
   is responsible for mycolactone-dependent translation attenuation, which
   initially protects cells from cell death. However, chronic activation
   without stress remediation enhances autophagy and apoptosis of cells by
   a pathway facilitated by ATF4 and CHOP. Our findings demonstrate that
   priming events at the ER can result in the sensing of stress within
   different cellular compartments.

AB Previous work on clinical relation extraction from free-text sentences
   leveraged information about semantic types from clinical knowledge bases
   as a part of entity representations. In this paper, we exploit
   additional evidence by also making use of domain-specific semantic type
   dependencies. We encode the relation between a span of tokens matching a
   Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept and other tokens in the
   sentence. We implement our method and compare against different named
   entity recognition (NER) architectures (i.e., BiLSTM-CRF and
   BiLSTM-GCN-CRF) using different pre-trained clinical embeddings (i.e.,
   BERT, BioBERT, UMLSBert). Our experimental results on clinical datasets
   show that in some cases NER effectiveness can be significantly improved
   by making use of domain-specific semantic type dependencies. Our work is
   also the first study generating a matrix encoding to make use of more
   than three dependencies in one pass for the NER task.

AB In this paper, we developed a feasible and efficient deep-learning-based
   framework to combine the United States (US) natality data for the last
   five decades, with changing variables and factors, into a consistent
   database. We constructed a graph based on the property and elements of
   databases, including variables, and conducted a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) to learn the embeddings of variables on the constructed
   graph, where the learned embeddings implied the similarity of variables.
   Specifically, we devised a loss function with a slack margin and a
   banlist mechanism (for a random walk) to learn the desired structure
   (two nodes sharing more information were more similar to each other.),
   and developed an active learning mechanism to conduct the harmonization.
   Toward a total of 9,321 variables from 49 databases (i.e., 783 stemmed
   variables, from 1970 to 2018), we applied our model iteratively together
   with human reviews for four rounds, then obtained 323 hyperchains of
   variables. During the harmonization, the first round of our model
   achieved recall and precision of 87.56%, 57.70%, respectively. Our
   harmonized graph neural network (HGNN) method provides a feasible and
   efficient way to connect relevant databases at a meta-level. Adapting to
   the database's property and characteristics, HGNN can learn patterns
   globally, which is powerful to discover the similarity between variables
   among databases. Our proposed method provides an effective way to reduce
   the manual effort in database harmonization and integration of
   fragmented data into useful databases for future research.

AB The continuous development of intelligent traffic control systems has a
   profound influence on urban traffic planning and traffic management.
   Indeed, as big data and artificial intelligence continue to evolve, the
   traffic control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) has
   been proven to be a promising method to improve the efficiency of
   intersections and save people's travel time. However, the existing
   algorithms ignore the temporal and spatial characteristics of
   intersections. In this article, we propose a multiagent RL based on the
   deep spatiotemporal attentive neural network (MARL-DSTAN) to determine
   the traffic signal timing in a large-scale road network. In this model,
   the state information captures the spatial dependency of the entire road
   network by leveraging the graph convolutional network (GCN) and
   integrates the information based on the importance of intersections via
   the attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to accumulate more valuable samples
   and enhance the learning efficiency, the recurrent neural network (RNN)
   is introduced in the exploration stage to constrain the action search
   space instead of fully random exploration. MARL-DSTAN decomposes the
   large-scale area into multiple base environments, and the agents in each
   base environment use the idea of ``centralized training and
   decentralized execution'' to learn to accelerate the algorithm
   convergence. The simulation results show that our algorithm
   significantly outperforms the fixed timing scheme and several other
   state-of-the-art baseline RL algorithms.

AB With increasingly cyber-attacks and intrusion techniques, the threat of
   network security has become more andmore serious. However, existing
   solutions are no longer sufficient in terms of accuracy as attacks
   continueto grow in quantity and complexity. Prior methods mainly focused
   on the application of deep learningtechniques to analyze data changes in
   traffic flow. The cunning Cyber-attacks cannot be detected becausesome
   advanced attack techniques can conceal attacks and make them might seem
   innocuous in statistics. Atthe same time, traditional models only
   concentrate on the statistics of traffic sent by individual hosts, so
   thepotential relationships of communication patterns in network traffic
   might be ignored. It makes these solutionsare not competent for dealing
   with the various uncertainty in network traffic. In this paper, we
   propose anefficient anomaly detection approach, called AnoGLA, which
   considering the complex communication patternsbetween network structure
   and node properties. To mine the hidden relationship between network
   traffic, webuilt graph structured data in network traffic and exploits
   graph convolution network (GCN) for modeling. Andwe also combine long
   short-term memory network (LSTM) with Attention mechanism to extract the
   changeinformation of the graph at different times. The effectiveness and
   robustness of proposed method are evaluatedon two real-world datasets.
   The experiment results indicate that our scheme can effectively detect

   Compared with the existing techniques, the proposed approach considers
   explicit spatial information in sampling sequences as prior knowledge
   and it has stronger feature extraction ability. On this basis, a
   framework for transient fault detection and classification is created.
   Graph structure is generated to provide topology information to the
   task. Our approach takes the adjacency matrix of topology graph and the
   bus voltage signals during a sampling period after transient faults as
   inputs, and outputs the predicted classification results rapidly.
   Furthermore, the proposed approach is tested in various situations and
   its generalization ability is verified by experimental results. The
   results show that the proposed approach can detect and classify
   transient faults more effectively than the existing techniques, and it
   is practical for online transmission line protection for its rapidness,
   high robustness and generalization ability.

AB Event detection, specifically, identifying the type of events in a piece
   of text, is a crucial task in information extraction. Previous event
   detection task research proved that a syntactic graph based on a
   dependency tree can be integrated into a graph convolutional neural
   network to better capture the context of a sentence. However, most of
   the existing studies rely only on first-order syntactic relations and
   usually ignore dependence label information. In this paper, we propose a
   multi-order edge-aware graph convolution network (MEA-GCN) based on
   multi -order grammar and typed dependent label information. We use the
   BERT representation and the multi-head attention update mechanism to
   generate a variety of multi-order syntactic graph representations;
   consequently, our model can automatically learn dependent information
   and improve the representation ability of the syntactic relations. The
   experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 and TAC KBP 2015 show
   that our model achieves significant improvement over the competitive
   baseline methods.

   visible-light-activated photocatalytic membrane was prepared by loading
   polyethyleneimine-graphitic carbon nitride (PEI-GCN) on polydopamine
   (PDA) coated membrane for highly efficient production of H2O2.
   Fenton-like reaction was triggered upon H2O2 contacting with a
   separation membrane with FeOOH catalytic layer, which was fabricated via
   a co-deposition method followed by mineralization. Oxidation of the
   organic compound was initiated by hydroxyl radicals generated through
   the Fenton-like reactions in the presence of photogenerated H2O2, thus
   achieving effective membrane cleaning. This sectional
   photocatalysis-membrane cleaning technique independent of the separation
   membrane module offers a possibility for sustainable membrane fouling
   control in large-scale application.

AB Multi-view clustering has become an active topic in artificial
   intelligence. Yet, similar investigation for graph-structured data
   clustering has been absent so far. To fill this gap, we present a
   Multi-View Graph embedding Clustering network (MVGC). Specifically,
   unlike traditional multi-view construction methods, which are only
   suitable to describe Euclidean structure data, we leverage Euler
   transform to augment the node attribute, as a new view descriptor, for
   non-Euclidean structure data. Meanwhile, we impose block diagonal
   representation constraint, which is measured by the l(1,2)-norm, on
   self-expression coefficient matrix to well explore the cluster
   structure. By doing so, the learned view-consensus coefficient matrix
   well encodes the discriminative information. Moreover, we make use of
   the learned clustering labels to guide the learnings of node
   representation and coefficient matrix, where the latter is used in turn
   to conduct the subsequent clustering. In this way, clustering and
   representation learning are seamlessly connected, with the aim to
   achieve better clustering performance. Extensive experimental results
   indicate that MVGC is superior to 11 state-of-the-art methods on four
   benchmark datasets. In particular, MVGC achieves an Accuracy of 96.17%
   (53.31%) on the ACM (IMDB) dataset, which is an up to 2.85% (1.97%)
   clustering performance improvement compared with the strongest baseline.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been extensively utilized to
   extract relations among electroencephalography (EEG) electrode channels
   for its strong ability to handle non-Euclidean data. However, GCN still
   has some issues when it comes to extracting features from EEG signals:
   (1) GCN with more layers may experience over-smoothing, restricting its
   ability to mine longer dependency relations. (2) At the moment, most
   GCNs used to process EEG signals construct adjacency matrices by
   Euclidean distance, only considering the correlations on the feature
   domain while ignoring changes of signals over the entire time window. To
   address the issues above, we introduce an Ordinary Differential Equation
   (ODE) based GCN, which can perfectly eliminate the over-smoothing
   problem of the traditional GCN. Besides, we also propose a method based
   on Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) algorithm to construct an adjacency
   matrix in the time domain. To handle adjacency matrices calculated by
   Euclidean distance and DTW distance respectively, we apply a
   temporal-spatial model composed of two parallel modules each containing
   an ODE-based GCN and Long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM)
   network in turn. We conducted experiments on three public datasets. The
   results show that our methods have achieved an improvement of
   2.19%/2.77%/2.13%/2.01% on Arousal/Valence/Dominance/Liking on DEAP
   dataset, 1.43% on SEED dataset and 3.06%/3.27% on Arousal/Valence on
   DREAMER dataset compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline methods.
   It demonstrates that our method can effectively approve the performance
   to handle the relations between EEG channels. The premise of the
   ODE-based GCN is that signal changes of all EEG channels should be
   continuous rather than abrupt. We believe that it conforms to the EEG
   mode, as it is activated by the same emotion stimulation while being
   collected.

AB Motivation: In recent years, a large number of biological experiments
   have strongly shown that miRNAs play an important role in understanding
   disease pathogenesis. The discovery of miRNA-disease associations is
   beneficial for disease diagnosis and treatment. Since inferring these
   associations through biological experiments is time-consuming and
   expensive, researchers have sought to identify the associations
   utilizing computational approaches. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs),
   which exhibit excellent performance in link prediction problems, have
   been successfully used in miRNA-disease association prediction. However,
   GCNs only consider 1st-order neighborhood information at one layer but
   fail to capture information from high-order neighbors to learn miRNA and
   disease representations through information propagation. Therefore, how
   to aggregate information from high-order neighborhood effectively in an
   explicit way is still challenging. Results: To address such a challenge,
   we propose a novel method called mixed neighborhood information for
   miRNA-disease association (MINIMDA), which could fuse mixed high-order
   neighborhood information of miRNAs and diseases in multimodal networks.
   First, MINIMDA constructs the integrated miRNA similarity network and
   integrated disease similarity network respectively with their
   multisource information. Then, the embedding representations of miRNAs
   and diseases are obtained by fusing mixed high-order neighborhood
   information from multimodal network which are the integrated miRNA
   similarity network, integrated disease similarity network and the
   miRNA-disease association networks. Finally, we concentrate the
   multimodal embedding representations of miRNAs and diseases and feed
   them into the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict their underlying
   associations. Extensive experimental results show that MINIMDA is
   superior to other state-of-the-art methods overall. Moreover, the
   outstanding performance on case studies for esophageal cancer, colon
   tumor and lung cancer further demonstrates the effectiveness of MINIMDA.

AB Accurate residential load forecasting (RLF) is of great significance for
   the decision-making and operation of modern power system. In literature,
   deep neural network (DNN) based RLF schemes have witnessed great
   development due to the advantage of automatically extracting features
   and capturing complex non-linear pattern in the presented data. However,
   most existed works separately exploit the historical data of a specific
   residential house to forecast its load. However, the electricity
   consumption behaviors among residential users are not independent, and
   implicitly have some correlations, which can be explicitly characterized
   and exploited to improve the accuracy of RLF forecasting. Inspired by
   this idea, through exploiting the multiple correlations among
   households, this paper proposes a novel residential load forecasting
   framework based on multiple correlation-temporal graph neural networks,
   RLF-MGNN. Specifically, the novelty of our work includes three aspects.
   First, multiple graphs are explicitly constructed to represent both
   linear and nonlinear correlations among temporal load series of
   households. That is, the synchronization graph is built to describe the
   degree of linear correlation between two households using Pearson
   correlation coefficient, which characterizes the similarity of their
   consumption behaviors, and the causality graph is built to describe
   their nonlinear correlation using transfer entropy, which characterizes
   the amount of directional information transfer from one time series to
   another, and models the mutual influence between households. Second, the
   multiple correlation-temporal graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are
   designed to forecast the residential users' loads. In detail, at each
   timestep, latent features are first extracted by corresponding GCNs to
   embed multiple correlations among households, and then are sent to Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for further learning the latent temporal
   features. Finally, thorough experiments on real datasets demonstrate
   that our proposed RLF-MGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art independent
   DNN based schemes and other GNN based schemes.

AB Drug repositioning, an important method of drug development, is utilized
   to discover investigational drugs beyond the originally approved
   indications, expand the application scope of drugs, and reduce the cost
   of drug development. With the emergence of increasingly
   drug-diseaserelated biological networks, the challenge still remains to
   effectively fuse biological entity data and accurately achieve
   drug-disease repositioning. This paper proposes a new drug repositioning
   method named EMPHCN based on enhanced message passing and hypergraph
   convolutional networks (HGCN). It firstly constructs the homogeneous
   multi-view information with multiple drug similarity features and then
   extracts the intra-domain embedding of drugs through the combination of
   HGCN and channel attention mechanism. Secondly, inter-domain information
   of known drug-disease associations is extracted by graph convolutional
   networks combining node and edge embedding (NEEGCN), and a heterogeneous
   network composed of drugs, proteins and diseases is built as an
   important auxiliary to enhance the inter-domain message passing of drugs
   and diseases. Besides, the intra-domain embedding of diseases is also
   extracted through HGCN. Ultimately, intra-domain and inter-domain
   embeddings of drugs and diseases are integrated as the final embedding
   for calculating the drug-disease correlation matrix. Through 10-fold
   cross-validation on some benchmark datasets, we find that the AUPR of
   EMPHCN reaches 0.593 (T1) and 0.526 (T2), respectively, and the AUC
   achieves 0.887 (T1) and 0.961 (T2) respectively, which shows that EMPHCN
   has an advantage over other state-of-the-art prediction methods.
   Concerning the new disease association prediction, the AUC of EMPHCN
   through the five-fold cross-validation reaches 0.806 (T1) and 0.845
   (T2), which are 4.3% (T1) and 4.0% (T2) higher than the second best
   existing methods, respectively. In the case study, EMPHCN also achieves
   satisfactory results in real drug repositioning for breast carcinoma and
   Parkinson's disease.

AB Lanthanum (La) has some advantages of smaller radius, cheaper price and
   higher affinity for oxygen in rare-earth-metallic element group, and
   La2O3 modification may be helpful to further extend the life of
   photoninduced electrons and holes due to its rich energy levels, special
   optical properties and 4f electronic transition properties. Inspired by
   these items, graphite carbon nitride (GCN)/La2O3 (denoted as CN/La) was
   prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The characterizations of
   photocatalysts were conducted using X-ray diffraction, field emission
   scanning electron microscope, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption
   isotherms. The Methyl orange (MO), Methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B
   (RhB) were applied to characterize the photocatalytic performances of
   CN/La-x% photocatalysts under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420
   nm). CN/La-6% exhibited the optimal photodegradation efficiency, and
   66.6% of MO, 99.5% of RhB and 100% of MB could be removed in 120 min.
   The BET surface area was improved from 8.357 m(2)g(-1) to 67.818
   m(2)g(-1) and the light absorption edge shifted from 468 nm to 484 nm.
   In addition, the photocurrent density increased from 0.96 mu A/cm(2) to
   4.82 mu A/cm(2). The improved photodegradation efficiency was attributed
   to larger BET surface area, extended optical absorption and enhanced
   charge carrier separation. More interestingly, this work lays the
   foundation for practical application of the La2O3-modified GCN material
   as the photocatalytic catalysts.

AB Heat stress (HS) negatively affects chicken performance. Agricultural
   expansion will happen in regions that experience high ambient
   temperatures, where fast-growing commercial chickens are vulnerable.
   Indigenous chickens of such regions, due to generations of exposure to
   environmental challenges, might have higher thermal tolerance. In this
   study, two indigenous chicken ecotypes, from the hot and humid Mombasa
   (lowland) and the colder Naivasha (highland) regions, were used to
   investigate the effects of acute (5 h, 35 degrees C) and chronic (3days
   of 35 degrees C for 8 h/day) HS on the cardiac and skeletal muscle,
   through RNA sequencing. The rectal temperature gain and the number of
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [False Discovery Rate (FDR) <
   0.05] were two times higher in the acute stage than in the chronic stage
   in both ecotypes, suggesting that cyclic exposure to HS can lead to
   adaptation. A tissue- and stage-specific difference in response to HS
   was observed, with peroxisome proliferator-activated-receptor (PPAR)
   signaling and mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,
   enriched in heart and skeletal muscle, respectively, and the p53 pathway
   enriched only in the acute stage in both tissues. The acute and chronic
   stage DEGs were integrated by a region-specific gene coexpression
   network (GCN), and genes with the highest number of connections (hub
   genes) were identified. The hub genes in the lowland network were CCNB2,
   Crb2, CHST9, SESN1, and NR4A3, while COMMD4, TTC32, H1F0, ACYP1, and
   RPS28 were the hub genes in the highland network. Pathway analysis of
   genes in the GCN showed that p53 and PPAR signaling pathways were
   enriched in both low and highland networks, while MAPK signaling and
   protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were enriched only in the
   gene network of highland chickens. This shows that to dissipate the
   accumulated heat, to reduce heat induced apoptosis, and to promote DNA
   damage repair, the ecotypes activated or suppressed different genes,
   indicating the differences in thermal tolerance and HS response
   mechanisms between the ecotypes. This study provides information on the
   HS response of chickens, adapted to two different agro climatic
   environments, extending our understanding of the mechanisms of HS
   response and the effect of adaptation in counteracting HS.

AB Vision-based sign language translation technology (SLT) has brought the
   communication distance between deaf and ordinary people closer to a
   certain extent. The obstacle of SLT is mainly in two aspects: firstly,
   when capturing sign language action features, it is impossible to
   effectively overcome the shortcomings such as redundant information of
   sign language gesture features and motion ambiguity; secondly, it is
   difficult to define the alignment between action sequences and lexical
   sequences when processing sentence-level sign language videos. To
   overcome these problems, this paper proposes a sign language translation
   method based on residual spatial graph convolution network (Res-SGCN)
   and temporal attention model. Where, the Res-SGCN module is used to
   capture the spatial interaction feature information between the sign
   language skeleton nodes, and subsequently the temporal attention network
   is used to capture the temporal dimensional information fusion of the
   sign language spatial feature sequence and align it with the predicted
   vocabulary for translation. Experiments on public datasets show that the
   word error rate(WER) output by the proposed model reaches 4.17%, which
   is superior to other advanced sign language translation methods.

AB BACKGROUND: Depression is a common mental illness, with around 280
   million people suffering from depression worldwide. At present, the main
   way to quantify the severity of depression is through psychometric
   scales, which entail subjectivity on the part of both patient and
   clinician. In the last few years, deep (machine) learning is emerging as
   a more objective approach for measuring depression severity. We now
   investigate how neural networks might serve for the early diagnosis of
   depression.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We searched Medline (Pubmed) for articles
   published up to June 1, 2023. The search term included Depression AND
   Diagnostics AND Artificial Intelligence. We did not search for
   depression studies of machine learning other than neural networks, and
   selected only those papers attesting to diagnosis or screening for
   depression.
   RESULTS: Fifty-four papers met our criteria, among which 14 using facial
   expression recordings, 14 using EEG, 5 using fMRI, and 5 using audio
   speech recording analysis, whereas 6 used multimodality approach, two
   were the text analysis studies, and 8 used other methods.
   CONCLUSIONS: Research methodologies include both audio and video
   recordings of clinical interviews, task performance, including their
   subsequent conversion into text, and resting state studies (EEG, MRI,
   fMRI). Convolutional neural networks (CNN), including 3D-CNN and 2D-CNN,
   can obtain diagnostic data from the videos of the facial area. Deep
   learning in relation to EEG signals is the most commonly used CNN. fMRI
   approaches use graph convolutional networks and 3D-CNN with voxel
   connectivity, whereas the text analyses use CNNs, including LSTM
   (long/short-term memory). Audio recordings are analyzed by a hybrid CNN
   and support vector machine model. Neural networks are used to analyze
   biomaterials, gait, polysomnography, ECG, data from wrist wearable
   devices, and present illness history records. Multimodality studies
   analyze the fusion of audio features with visual and textual features
   using LSTM and CNN architectures, a temporal convolutional network, or a
   recurrent neural network. The accuracy of different hybrid and
   multimodality models is 78-99%, relative to the standard clinical
   diagnoses.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can capture abundant spatial and
   polarimetric information of land cover objects, and thus polarimetric
   SAR (PolSAR) image classification has been developed for various
   applications. Combining the advantages of spatial and polarimetric
   information simultaneously is of great importance for PolSAR image
   classification. In this article, a feature enhanced superpixel
   hypergraph neural network (FESHNN) is proposed for PolSAR image
   classification, which aims to take full advantage of spatial features
   and polarimetric features from PolSAR images. In the proposed model,
   superpixel hypergraph neural network is constructed for feature
   representation of superpixels, which aims to obtain spatial correlation
   and polarimetric correlation in a hypergraph. Then, a feature
   enhancement module is employed to refine the local features of pixels
   and the spatial features of superpixels, which aims to enhance the
   discrimination of feature representation. Experimental results on three
   PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior
   classification performance compared with other related approaches.

AB Inkjet printing (IJP) is one of the promising additive manufacturing
   techniques that yield many innovations in electronic and biomedical
   products. In IJP, the products are fabricated by depositing droplets on
   substrates, and the quality of the products is highly affected by the
   droplet pinch-off behaviors. Therefore, identifying pinch-off behaviors
   of droplets is critical. However, annotating the pinch-off behaviors is
   burdensome since a large amount of images of pinch-off behaviors can be
   collected. Active learning (AL) is a machine learning technique which
   extracts human knowledge by iteratively acquiring human annotation and
   updating the classification model for the pinch-off behaviors
   identification. Consequently, a good classification performance can be
   achieved with limited labels. However, during the query process, the
   most informative instances (i.e., images) are varying and most query
   strategies in AL cannot handle these dynamics since they are
   handcrafted. Thus, this paper proposes a multiclass reinforced active
   learning (MCRAL) framework in which a query strategy is trained by
   reinforcement learning (RL). We designed a unique intrinsic reward
   signal to improve the classification model performance. Moreover, how to
   extract the features from images for pinch-off behavior identification
   is not trivial. Thus, we used a graph convolutional network for droplet
   image feature extraction. The results show that MCRAL excels AL and can
   reduce human efforts in pinch-off behavior identification. We further
   demonstrated that, by linking the process parameters to the predicted
   droplet pinch-off behaviors, the droplet pinch-off behavior can be
   adjusted based on MCRAL.

AB Remote sensing image captioning, which aims to understand high-level
   semantic information and interactions of different ground objects, is a
   new emerging research topic in recent years. Though image captioning has
   developed rapidly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the image captioning task for remote
   sensing images still suffers from two main limitations. One limitation
   is that the scales of objects in remote sensing images vary
   dramatically, which makes it difficult to obtain an effective image
   representation. Another limitation is that the visual relationship in
   remote sensing images is still underused, which should have great
   potential to improve the final performance. In order to deal with these
   two limitations, an effective framework for captioning the remote
   sensing image is proposed in this paper. The framework is based on
   multi-level attention and multi-label attribute graph convolution.
   Specifically, the proposed multi-level attention module can adaptively
   focus not only on specific spatial features, but also on features of
   specific scales. Moreover, the designed attribute graph convolution
   module can employ the attribute-graph to learn more effective attribute
   features for image captioning. Extensive experiments are conducted and
   the proposed method achieves superior performance on UCM-captions,
   Sydney-captions and RSICD dataset.

AB Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has attracted more
   attentions because of its excellent observation ability, and PolSAR
   image classification has become one of the significant tasks in remote
   sensing interpretation. Various types and sizes of land cover objects
   lead to misclassification, especially in the boundaries of different
   categories. To solve these issues, a multiscale superpixel-guided
   weighted graph convolutional network (MSGWGCN) is proposed for
   classifying PolSAR images. In the proposed MSGWGCN, multiscale
   superpixel features are imported into the weighted graph convolutional
   network to obtain higher level representation, which can make full use
   of land cover object information in PolSAR images. Moreover, to fuse
   pixel-level features at different scales, a multiscale feature cascade
   fusion module is built, which plays an important role in preserving
   classification details. Experiments on three PolSAR datasets indicate
   that the proposed MSGWGCN performs better than other advanced methods on
   PolSAR classification task.

AB Deep learning models have shown great potential in remote sensing (RS)
   image processing and analysis. Nevertheless, there are insufficient
   labeled samples to train deep networks, which seriously affects the
   performance of these models. To resolve this contradiction, we propose a
   generative self-supervised feature learning (S2FL) architecture for
   multimodal RS image land cover classification. Specifically, multiple
   complementary observed views are constructed from multimodal RS images,
   which are employed for following generative self-supervised learning
   (SSL). The proposed S2FL architecture is capable of extracting
   high-level meaningful feature representations from multiview data, and
   this process does not require any labeled information, providing a
   feasible solution to relieve the urgent need for annotated samples. The
   learned features are normalized and merged with corresponding spectral
   information to further improve the discriminative capability of feature
   representations, and we utilize these fused features for land cover
   classification. Compared with the existing supervised, semi-supervised,
   and self-supervised approaches, the proposed generative self-supervised
   model achieves superior performance in terms of feature learning and
   land cover classification, especially in the small sample classification
   case.

AB Textile defect recognition is a significant technique in the production
   processes of the textile industry. However, in the practical processes,
   it is hard to acquire large amounts of textile defect samples.
   Meanwhile, the textile samples with correct defect labels are rare. To
   address these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel
   semi-supervised graph convolutional network for few labeled textile
   defect recognition. First, we construct the graph convolutional network
   and convolution neural network to extract spectral features and spatial
   features. Second, the adaptive convolution structure is proposed to
   generate adaptive kernels according to their dynamically learned
   features. Finally, the spatial-spectral adaptive unified learning
   network (SSA-ULNet) is built for limited labeled defective samples, and
   graph-based semi-supervised learning is constructed. The textile defect
   recognition model can extract the textile image features through the
   image descriptors, enabling the whole network to be end-to-end
   trainable. To evaluate the proposed method, one public dataset and two
   unique self-built textile defect datasets are used to textile defect
   recognition. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed
   SSA-ULNet obviously outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning
   methods.

AB Pseudogenes are indicating more and more functional potentials recently,
   though historically were regarded as relics of evolution. Computational
   methods for predicting pseudogene functions on Gene Ontology is
   important for directing experimental discovery. However, no
   pseudogene-specific computational methods have been proposed to directly
   predict their Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The biggest challenge for
   pseudogene function prediction is the lack of enough features and
   functional annotations, making training a predictive model difficult.
   Considering the close functional similarity between pseudogenes and
   their parent coding genes that share great amount of DNA sequence, as
   well as that coding genes have rich annotations, we aim to predict
   pseudogene functions by borrowing information from coding genes in a
   graph-based way. Here we propose Pseudo2GO, a graph-based deep learning
   semi-supervised model for pseudogene function prediction. A sequence
   similarity graph is first constructed to connect pseudogenes and coding
   genes. Multiple features are incorporated into the model as the node
   attributes to enable the graph an attributed graph, including expression
   profiles, interactions with microRNAs, protein-protein interactions
   (PPIs), and genetic interactions. Graph convolutional networks are used
   to propagate node attributes across the graph to make classifications on
   pseudogenes. Comparing Pseudo2GO with other frameworks adapted from
   popular protein function prediction methods, we demonstrated that our
   method has achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly
   outperforming other methods in terms of the M-AUPR metric.

AB Understanding maritime network structure and traffic flow changes is a
   challenging task that must incorporate economic, energy, geopolitics,
   maritime transportation, and network sciences. Crude oil is the most
   imported energy in the world. Investigating the crude oil maritime
   network status and predicting the crude oil traffic flow changes has
   great significance for the global trade, especially for key crude oil
   importing/exporting regions and countries. To address this, a
   system-based approach using long short-term memory and graph convolution
   network for the crude oil traffic flow forecasting named LGCOTFF is
   introduced. The LGCOTFF approach constructs a maritime transportation
   network firstly, and then calculates and predicts the node traffic flow
   based on trajectory data and crude oil berth geographical position.
   Firstly, we construct a maritime crude oil transportation network based
   on supply-demand relationship, ship trajectory and route information.
   Then, we design an approach to calculate how many crude oil ships
   finished up-load/offtake tasks in a single week for each port, and
   gather this data to countries and regions. Finally, we design a deep
   learning neural network named long short-term memory and graph
   convolution network (L-GCN) to extract the temporal and spatial
   characteristics of crude oil transportation, and predict the node
   traffic flow. We evaluate the proposed model on China, Russia, Middle
   East and America respectively and observe consistent improvement of more
   than 10% over state-of-the-art baselines.

AB The pervasive impact of Alzheimer's disease on aging society represents
   one of the main challenges at this time. Current investigations
   highlight 2 specific misfolded proteins in its development:
   Amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Previous studies focused on spreading for
   misfolded proteins exploited simulations, which required several
   parameters to be empirically estimated. Here, we provide an alternative
   view based on 2 machine learning approaches which we compare with known
   simulation models. The first approach applies an autoregressive model
   constrained by structural connectivity, while the second is based on
   graph convolutional networks. The aim is to predict concentrations of
   Amyloid-$\beta$ 2 yr after a provided baseline. We also evaluate its
   real-world effectiveness and suitability by providing a web service for
   physicians and researchers. In experiments, the autoregressive model
   generally outperformed state-of-the-art models resulting in lower
   prediction errors. While it is important to note that a comprehensive
   prognostic plan cannot solely rely on amyloid beta concentrations, their
   prediction, achieved by the discussed approaches, can be valuable for
   planning therapies and other cures, especially when dealing with
   asymptomatic patients for whom novel therapies could prove effective.

AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide detailed spectral information of
   objects to be detected and play an important role in distinguishing
   targets with a similar appearance. However, the characteristics of high
   dimensionality and complexity impose significant challenges for
   realizing pixelwise classification. Although existing convolutional
   neural networks and transformer-based models have presented promising
   performance for HSIs classification, they mainly extract features from
   spectral-spatial perspective and do not fully consider the information
   in the frequency domain. To address this issue, in this article, we
   reconsider feature extraction and HSIs classification from the frequency
   domain. Specifically, inspired by the observation that high-frequency
   information contains detailed features within a local receptive field,
   whereas low-frequency information provides global smooth variations, a
   frequency domain feature extraction (FDFE) block with dual branches is
   developed. In the FDFE block, a multihead neighborhood attention block
   and a global filter block are designed to capture high- and
   low-frequency features, respectively. Besides, a pixel embedding module
   is constructed. Based on these, a novel hierarchical dual frequency
   transformer network is developed. Extensive experiments are performed on
   three open public hyperspectral datasets to evaluate the performance of
   our developed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our
   method is efficient and robust for HSIs classification, achieving
   overall accuracies of 94.14%, 86.92%, and 96.72% on the University of
   Pavia, University of Houston, and University of Trento datasets,
   respectively.al

AB As an important branch of machine learning, recommendation algorithms
   have attracted the attention of many experts and scholars. The current
   recommendation algorithms all more or less have problems such as cold
   start and single recommended items. In order to overcome these problems
   and improve the accuracy of personalized recommendation algorithms, this
   paper proposes a recommendation for multi-task learning based on
   directed graph convolutional network (referred to as MTL-DGCNR) and
   applies it to recommended areas for e-commerce. First, the user's
   micro-behavior is constructed and converted into directed graph
   structure data for model embedding. It can fully consider the embedding
   of first-order proximity nodes and second-order proximity nodes, which
   can effectively enhance the transformation ability of features.
   Secondly, this model adopts the multi-task learning method, and uses
   knowledge graph embedding to effectively deal with the one-to-many or
   many-to-many relationship between users and commodities. Finally, it is
   verified by experiments that MTL-DGCNR has a higher interpretability and
   accuracy in the field of e-commerce recommendation than other
   recommendation models. The ranking evaluation experiments, various
   training methods comparison experiments, and controlling parameter
   experiments are designed from multiple perspectives to verify the
   rationality of MTL-DGCNR.

AB Traffic flow forecasting, as one of the important components of
   intelligent transport systems (ITS), plays an indispensable role in a
   wide range of applications such as traffic management and city planning.
   However, complex spatial dependencies and dynamic changes in temporal
   patterns exist between different routes, and obtaining as many
   spatial-temporal features and dependencies as possible from node data
   has been a challenging task in traffic flow prediction. Current
   approaches typically use independent modules to treat temporal and
   spatial correlations separately without synchronously capturing such
   spatial-temporal correlations, or focus only on local spatial-temporal
   dependencies, thereby ignoring the implied long-term spatial-temporal
   periodicity. With this in mind, this paper proposes a long-term
   spatial-temporal graph convolutional fusion network (LSTFGCN) for
   traffic flow prediction modeling. First, we designed a synchronous
   spatial-temporal feature capture module, which can fruitfully extract
   the complex local spatial-temporal dependence of nodes. Second, we
   designed an ordinary differential equation graph convolution (ODEGCN) to
   capture more long-term spatial-temporal dependence using the
   spatial-temporal graph convolution of ordinary differential equation. At
   the same time, by integrating in parallel the ODEGCN, the
   spatial-temporal graph convolution attention module (GCAM), and the
   gated convolution module, we can effectively make the model learn more
   long short-term spatial-temporal dependencies in the processing of
   spatial-temporal sequences.Our experimental results on multiple public
   traffic datasets show that our method consistently obtained the optimal
   performance compared to the other baselines.

AB The detection of drivable areas in off-road scenes is a challenging
   problem due to the presence of unstructured class boundaries, irregular
   features, and dust noise. Three-dimensional LiDAR data can effectively
   describe the terrain features, and a bird's eye view (BEV) not only
   shows these features, but also retains the relative size of the
   environment compared to the forward viewing. In this paper, a method
   called LRTI, which is used for detecting drivable areas based on the
   texture information of LiDAR reflection data, is proposed. By using an
   instance segmentation network to learn the texture information, the
   drivable areas are obtained. Furthermore, a multi-frame fusion strategy
   is applied to improve the reliability of the output, and a shelter's
   mask of a dynamic object is added to the neural network to reduce the
   perceptual delay caused by multi-frame fusion. Through TensorRT
   quantization, LRTI achieves real-time processing on the unmanned ground
   vehicle (UGV). The experiments on our dataset show the robustness and
   adaptability of LRTI to sand dust and occluded scenes.

AB Classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been becoming a hot issue
   along with the rapidly increasing number of patients. This task remains
   tremendously challenging due to the limited data and the difficulties in
   detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing methods use gait [or
   EEG (electroencephalogram)] data only to tackle this task. Although the
   gait data acquisition procedure is cheap and simple, the methods relying
   on gait data often fail to detect the slight difference between MCI and
   AD. The methods that use EEG data can detect the difference more
   precisely, but collecting EEG data from both HC (health controls) and
   patients is very time-consuming. More critically, these methods often
   convert EEG records into the frequency domain and thus inevitably lose
   the spatial and temporal information, which is essential to capture the
   connectivity and synchronization among different brain regions. This
   paper proposes a cascade neural network with two steps to achieve a
   faster and more accurate AD classification by exploiting gait and EEG
   data simultaneously. In the first step, we propose attention-based
   spatial temporal graph convolutional networks to extract the features
   from the skeleton sequences (i.e., gait) captured by Kinect (a commonly
   used sensor) to distinguish between HC and patients. In the second step,
   we propose spatial temporal convolutional networks to fully exploit the
   spatial and temporal information of EEG data and classify the patients
   into MCI or AD eventually. We collect gait and EEG data from 35
   cognitively health controls, 35 MCI, and 17 AD patients to evaluate our
   proposed method. Experimental results show that our method significantly
   outperforms other AD diagnosis methods (91.07 vs. 68.18%) in the
   three-way AD classification task (HC, MCI, and AD). Moreover, we
   empirically found that the lower body and right upper limb are more
   important for the early diagnosis of AD than other body parts. We
   believe this interesting finding can be helpful for clinical researches.

AB Mitigating thermal errors constitutes a crucial method for enhancing the
   machining accuracy of four-axis machining centers. At the heart of
   effective thermal error control lie the thermal error control platform
   and a resilient thermal error prediction model. It is imperative to note
   that thermal errors exhibit intricate dynamic and nonlinear
   spatiotemporal dependencies. However, prevailing thermal error
   prediction models tend to primarily focus on temporal features or employ
   simplistic spatiotemporal characteristics, resulting in diminished
   accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the present thermal error
   compensation system is plagued by a lack of userfriendliness, stemming
   from its suboptimal execution efficiency. In response to the
   aforementioned challenges, an innovative approach: the interactive
   fusion spatiotemporal graph convolutional network is proposed. This
   novel model is specifically designed to capture the intricate dynamic
   spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in thermal errors. The interactive
   fusion spatiotemporal graph convolutional network model consists of
   three essential components: a bilinear temporal convolutional network, a
   multi-layer spatiotemporal module, and a linear module. These components
   work in harmony to comprehensively extract both global and local
   spatiotemporal features. Subsequently, a mapping relationship between
   thermal errors and compensation components is established, laying the
   foundation for theoretical advancements in thermal error compensation
   within the realm of four-axis machining centers. A digital twin system
   framework tailored for error control is devised, which leverages
   cloud-edge computing to enable dynamic control and real-time monitoring
   of thermal errors. To assess the effectiveness of this digital twin
   system framework and the interactive fusion spatiotemporal graph
   convolutional network model, a series of rigorous experiments were
   conducted. The oriented to error-controlled digital twin system coupled
   with the interactive fusion spatiotemporal graph convolutional network
   model yielded exceptional machining accuracy, resulting in minimal
   geometric disparities of [-3.0 mu m, 3.0 mu m] for the central hole
   diameter D and [-3.5 mu m, 4.0 mu m] for the hole distance H.

AB To reduce the cargo loss rate caused by abnormal consumption behavior in
   smart retail cabinets, two problems need to be solved. The first is that
   the diversity of consumers leads to a diversity of actions contained in
   the same behavior, which makes the accuracy of consumer behavior
   identification low. Second, the difference between normal interaction
   behavior and abnormal interaction behavior is small, and anomalous
   features are difficult to define. Therefore, we propose an anomalous
   behavior detection algorithm with human-object interaction graph
   convolution and confidence-guided difference enhancement. Aiming to
   solve the problem of low accuracy of consumer behavior recognition,
   including interactive behavior, the human-object interaction graph
   convolutional network is used to recognize action and extract video
   frames of abnormal human behavior. To define anomalies, we detect
   anomalies by delineating anomalous areas of the anomaly video frames. We
   use a confidence-guided anomaly enhancement module to perform confidence
   detection on the encoder-extracted coded features using a confidence
   full connection layer. The experimental results showed that the action
   recognition algorithm had good generalization ability and accuracy, and
   the screened video frames have obvious destruction characteristics, and
   the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve
   reached 82.8% in the detection of abnormal areas. Our research provides
   a new solution for the detection of abnormal behavior that destroys
   commodity packaging, which has considerable application value.

AB The recommendation algorithm is an important means to alleviate the
   information explosion in the era of big data. There has been a great
   deal of research into the use of knowledge graphs as auxiliary
   information in recommender systems, which can be used to alleviate data
   sparsity and cold start problems. However, most knowledge graph -based
   recommendation methods only use rating data to capture the user's
   potential interest, and the rating is only a comprehensive evaluation of
   the item by the user, which cannot intuitively and accurately express
   the user's personalized preference. In addition, existing recommendation
   strategies that blend ratings and reviews cannot simultaneously model
   the aspect fine-grained sentiment preferences of users in reviews as
   well as the personalized characteristics of items from the user's
   perspective. To this end, in this paper, we propose Reviews Sentiment
   -Aware Knowledge Graph Convolutional Neural Network (RAKCR), a generic
   review and knowledge graph -based framework that provides better
   recommendations by fully mining the fine-grained personalization
   features in user reviews. In contrast to existing correlation
   recommendation methods, we designed a new reviews sentiment perception
   feature and knowledge graph alignment module to characterize user
   preferences for specific features of items in the knowledge graph. To
   better represent the personalized feature distribution of users and
   items, we use the proposed RAKCR to aggregate sentiment relationship
   weight -aware neighborhood information in the knowledge graph to capture
   personalized feature representations of both users and items, and to
   better learn user and item embeddings for more accurate personalized
   recommendations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   RAKCR model outperforms the benchmark model significantly in click
   -through rate prediction for recommendation scenarios. Across the three
   datasets, Movielens-20 m, Amazon -book, and Yelp, the AUC values show an
   average improvement of 6.4%, 6.0%, and 3.4%, respectively. Additionally,
   the F1 values exhibit an average improvement of 7.2%, 6.2%, and 4.1%,
   respectively, when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Distinguishing similar actions has been a challenging challenge in
   skeleton-based action recognition. Since the joint coordinates in these
   actions are similar, it is difficult to accomplish the recognition task
   using traditional joint features. To address this issue, the use of
   angle features to capture subtle nuances in various body parts, along
   with a critical angle enhancement module that assigns weights to
   different angle feature representations for a given action are proposed,
   highlighting the critical angle feature representation. The approach is
   evaluated using a three-stream ensemble method on three large action
   recognition datasets, NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400. The
   experimental results demonstrate that incorporating angular information
   can effectively complement joint and skeletal features, leading to
   improved recognition of similar actions and enhanced model performance
   and robustness.
   Human behaviour recognition is an important research direction in the
   field of computer vision, with broad application prospects in areas such
   as human-computer interaction, smart healthcare, video surveillance, and
   sports motion analysis. However, current skeleton-based behaviour
   recognition methods using graph convolutional networks still face some
   challenges, such as the difficulty of fully utilizing the dependencies
   among distant nodes and distinguishing similar actions. To address the
   limitations of existing graph convolution-based models in distinguishing
   similar actions, a multi-stream hierarchical perception graph
   convolutional network model that incorporates angle features is
   proposed. This model introduces four new angle feature representations
   to capture subtle variations in different body parts, providing
   discriminative features to differentiate action details. Additionally,
   it utilizes a key angle feature enhancement module to strengthen
   important angle features for specific actions. The model achieves
   recognition accuracies of 92.8% and 96.8% under the cross-subject and
   cross-view evaluation criteria of the NTU-RGB+D dataset, respectively,
   and attains accuracies of 89.2% and 90.8% under the cross-subject and
   cross-setup evaluation criteria of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset. The
   experimental results validate that angle information effectively
   enhances the model's accuracy and improves its ability to distinguish
   similar actions. image

AB Identification of active candidate compounds for target proteins, also
   called drug-protein interaction (DPI) prediction, is an essential but
   time-consuming and expensive step, which leads to fostering the
   development of drug discovery. In recent years, deep network-based
   learning methods were frequently proposed in DPIs due to their powerful
   capability of feature representation. However, the performance of
   existing DPI methods is still limited by insufficiently labeled
   pharmacological data and neglected intermolecular information.
   Therefore, overcoming these difficulties to perfect the performance of
   DPIs is an urgent challenge for researchers. In this article, we
   designed an innovative 'multi-modality attributes' learning-based
   framework for DPIs with molecular transformer and graph convolutional
   networks, termed, multi-modality attributes (MMA)-DPI. Specifically,
   intermolecular sub-structural information and chemical semantic
   representations were extracted through an augmented transformer module
   from biomedical data. A tri-layer graph convolutional neural network
   module was applied to associate the neighbor topology information and
   learn the condensed dimensional features by aggregating a heterogeneous
   network that contains multiple biological representations of drugs,
   proteins, diseases and side effects. Then, the learned representations
   were taken as the input of a fully connected neural network module to
   further integrate them in molecular and topological space. Finally, the
   attribute representations were fused with adaptive learning weights to
   calculate the interaction score for the DPIs tasks. MMA-DPI was
   evaluated in different experimental conditions and the results
   demonstrate that the proposed method achieved higher performance than
   existing state-of-the-art frameworks.

   audience rather than the athlete. For team sports videos such as
   volleyball and basketball videos, there are plenty of intra-team and
   inter-team relations. In this paper, a new task named Group Scene Graph
   Generation is introduced to better understand intra-team relations and
   inter-team relations in sports videos. To tackle this problem, a novel
   Hierarchical Relation Network is proposed. After all players in a video
   are finely divided into two teams, the feature of the two teams'
   activities and interactions will be enhanced by Graph Convolutional
   Networks, which are finally recognized to generate Group Scene Graph.
   For evaluation, built on Volleyball dataset with additional 9660 team
   activity labels, a Volleyball+ dataset is proposed. A baseline is set
   for better comparison and our experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the idea of our method can be
   directly utilized in another video-based task, Group Activity
   Recognition. Experiments show the priority of our method and display the
   link between the two tasks. Finally, from the athlete's view, we
   elaborately present an interpretation that shows how to utilize Group
   Scene Graph to analyze teams' activities and provide professional gaming
   suggestions.

AB Artifacts are the main cause of degradation in CT image quality and
   diagnostic accuracy. Because of the complex texture of CT images, it is
   a challenging task to automatically detect artifacts from limited image
   samples. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved
   great success and shown promising results in medical imaging due to
   their powerful learning ability. However, GCNs do not take the attention
   mechanism into consideration. To overcome their limitations, we propose
   a novel Regional-Temporal Graph Attention Network for motion artifact
   detection from computed tomography images (RT-GAT). In this paper, head
   CT images are viewed as a heterogeneous graph by taking regional and
   temporal information into consideration, and the graph attention network
   is utilized to extract the features of the constructed graph. Then, the
   feature vector is input into the classifier to detect the motion
   artifacts. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RT-GAT
   method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a real-world CT
   dataset.

AB The development of technology has strongly affected regional
   urbanization. With development of mobile communication technology,
   intelligent devices have become increasingly widely used in people's
   lives. The application of big data in urban computing is
   multidimensional; it has been involved in different fields, such as
   urban planning, network optimization, intelligent transportation, energy
   consumption and so on. Data analysis becomes particularly important for
   wireless networks. In this paper, a method for analyzing cellular
   traffic data was proposed. Firstly, a method to extract trend
   components, periodic components and essential components from complex
   traffic time series was proposed. Secondly, we introduced causality data
   mining. Different from traditional time series causality analysis, the
   depth of causal mining was increased. We conducted causality
   verification on different components of time series and the results
   showed that the causal relationship between base stations is different
   in trend component, periodic component and essential component in urban
   wireless network. This is crucial for urban planning and network
   management. Thirdly, DIC-ST: a spatial temporal time series prediction
   based on decomposition and integration system with causal structure
   learning was proposed by combining GCN. Final results showed that the
   proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of cellular traffic
   prediction. At the same time, this method can play a crucial role for
   urban computing in network management, intelligent transportation, base
   station siting and energy consumption when combined with remote sensing
   map information.

AB The exploration of drug-target interactions (DTI) is an essential stage
   in the drug development pipeline. Thanks to the assistance of
   computational models, notably in the deep learning approach, scientists
   have been able to shorten the time spent on this stage. Widely practiced
   deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks and
   recurrent neural networks are commonly employed in DTI prediction
   projects. However, they can hardly utilize the natural graph structure
   of molecular inputs. For that reason, a graph neural network (GNN) is an
   applicable choice for learning the chemical and structural
   characteristics of molecules when it represents molecular compounds as
   graphs and learns the compound features from those graphs. In an effort
   to construct an advanced deep learning-based model for DTI prediction,
   we propose Deep Neural Computation (DeepNC), which is a framework
   utilizing three GNN algorithms: Generalized Aggregation Networks
   (GENConv), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNConv), and Hypergraph
   Convolution-Hypergraph Attention (HypergraphConv). In short, our
   framework learns the features of drugs and targets by the layers of GNN
   and 1-D convolution network, respectively. Then, representations of the
   drugs and targets are fed into fully-connected layers to predict the
   binding affinity values. The models of DeepNC were evaluated on two
   benchmarked datasets (Davis, Kiba) and one independently proposed
   dataset (Allergy) to confirm that they are suitable for predicting the
   binding affinity of drugs and targets. Moreover, compared to the results
   of baseline methods that worked on the same problem, DeepNC proves to
   improve the performance in terms of mean square error and concordance
   index.

AB Early diagnosis and intervention are clinically con-sidered the
   paramount part of treating cerebral palsy (CP), so it is essential to
   design an efficient and interpretable automatic prediction system for
   CP. We highlight a significant difference between CP infants' frequency
   of human movement and that of the healthy group, which improves
   prediction performance. However, the existing deep learning-based
   methods did not use the frequency information of infants' movement for
   CP prediction. This paper proposes a frequency attention informed graph
   convolutional network and validates it on two consumer-grade RGB video
   datasets, namely MINI-RGBD and RVI-38 datasets. Our proposed frequency
   attention module aids in improving both classification performance and
   system interpretability. In addition, we design a frequency-binning
   method that retains the critical frequency of the human joint position
   data while filtering the noise. Our prediction performance achieves
   state-of-the-art research on both datasets. Our work demonstrates the
   effectiveness of frequency information in supporting the prediction of
   CP non-intrusively and provides a way for supporting the early diagnosis
   of CP in the resource-limited regions where the clinical resources are
   not abundant.

AB Traffic flow prediction is of great significance for traffic control,
   and it has been challenging for capturing the complex spatial-temporal
   correlation. However, most existing prediction methods only consider the
   spatial adjacency of the nodes (i.e., static spatial correlation),
   lacking sufficient analysis of non-stationary traffic conditions (i.e.,
   dynamic spatial correlation). The combination of static spatial
   correlation and dynamic spatial correlation enables the model to
   comprehensively analyze the feature of traffic flow at each moment and
   improve the mining capability. To address this problem, we use the
   multi-head self-attention mechanism to establish a hybrid model
   integrating static and dynamic spatial correlation neural network
   (SDSCNN) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct
   static adjacency matrix and dynamic adjacency matrix according to
   different methods. These two matrices are simultaneously input into
   Graph Attention Network for analysis. The two outputs are integrated by
   the sum operation. Then the fused static and dynamic spatial features
   are fed into the multi-head self-attention layer to analyze the temporal
   correlation. Also, multi-layer SDSCNNs are stacked to further analyze
   the dynamic correlations between road sections, as well as to improve
   the model's multi-step prediction capability. Finally, Multi-layer
   Perceptron is used to output the prediction results. Extensive
   experiments are conducted using the datasets PEMS04, PEMS08, and
   METR-LA. And the results demonstrate that our model shows a good
   prediction performance.

AB Human pose transfer has typically been modeled as a 2D image-to-image
   translation problem. This formulation ignores the human body shape prior
   in 3D space and inevitably causes implausible artifacts, especially when
   facing occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a
   lifting-and-projection framework to perform pose transfer in the 3D mesh
   space. The core of our framework is a foreground generation module, that
   consists of two novel networks: a lifting-and-projection network (LPNet)
   and an appearance detail compensating network (ADCNet). To leverage the
   human body shape prior, LPNet exploits the topological information of
   the body mesh to learn an expressive visual representation for the
   target person in the 3D mesh space. To preserve texture details, ADCNet
   is further introduced to enhance the feature produced by LPNet with the
   source foreground image. Such design of the foreground generation module
   enables the model to better handle difficult cases such as those with
   occlusions. Experiments on the iPER and Fashion datasets empirically
   demonstrate that the proposed lifting-and-projection framework is
   effective and outperforms the existing image-to-image-based and
   mesh-based methods on human pose transfer task in both self-transfer and
   cross-transfer settings.

AB Deep subspace clustering (DSC) has achieved considerable success in the
   classification task of hyperspectral images (HSIs) without background
   (defined as noisy samples) compared with traditional subspace clustering
   methods. Unfortunately, directly applying DSC to classify land-cover on
   HSI datasets with background may suffer from the degradation of
   classification performance. In this article, we propose an effective
   deep low-rank graph convolutional subspace clustering (DLR-GCSC)
   framework for improving the performance of land-cover classification on
   HSI datasets with background. Specifically, we design a joint
   spatial-spectral network to extract band- and patch-level features
   simultaneously by combining 1-D and 2-D autoencoders. Moreover, we
   construct a low-rank constrained fully connected layer as a
   self-expression layer in the network to make the joint features more
   discriminative. To reduce the influence of noisy samples and obtain an
   informative affinity matrix, we recast the joint features into a
   non-Euclidean domain by introducing graph convolution. Finally, spectral
   clustering is applied to the informative affinity matrix to obtain the
   classification results. Experiments on three benchmark HSI datasets show
   that our proposed method achieves competitive classification performance
   to the state-of-the-art methods on both HSI data with background and
   without background.

AB Since the number of superpixels is lower than that of pixels,
   superpixels can substantially speed up subsequent processing steps and
   have been widely used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image
   segmentation. However, in most of the existing superpixel-wise
   segmentation algorithms, superpixel prediction is an isolated
   preprocessing step and is independent of the segmentation task. The
   performance of the segmentation results is determined by the accuracy of
   superpixels. Once superpixels are generated, their shape cannot be
   changed in the following segmentation stage, even if the same
   superpixels contain pixels of different landcovers. To address this, we
   propose an end-to-end trainable superpixel-wise segmentation method for
   single-polarization SAR images. First, we design a differentiable
   boundary-ware clustering method for estimating task-specific
   superpixels. Instead of the hard association between pixels and
   superpixels in the existing superpixel algorithms, this method
   introduces the soft association map to make the clustering
   differentiable. Hence, it can be implemented using a simple deep fully
   convolutional network. In the segmentation part, we propose a novel soft
   graph convolution network (Soft-GCN), which takes the association map as
   input and performs superpixel-wise segmentation. The advantage of our
   method is that superpixel generation and graph convolution parts can be
   trained under a unified framework, until two parts obtain the optimum
   parameters. In the training process, it can adaptively adjust the shape
   of the superpixels according to the segmentation results, ensuring the
   superpixels correctly adhere the boundaries. Experimental results with
   simulated and real SAR images demonstrate that our method outperforms
   other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms, while also being faster.

AB The working accuracy of multi-linkage robot is seriously affected by the
   errors at the joints caused by the uncertainty factors such as
   vibration, wear, deformation, and manufacturing clearance. In order to
   improve the working accuracy, the joint motion prediction including
   these errors is researched, which can realize the follow-up errors
   pre-compensation. According to the spatial correlation and time
   dependence between the joints of the robot, the joints can be
   represented as a graph. This work proposes a joint trajectory prediction
   method based on graph convolutional neural network (GCN) and gated
   recurrent unit (GRU). A real experimental dataset is built to verify the
   effectiveness, including the uncertain errors. The method is validated
   by means of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
   Accuracy, and R-square. Experimental results demonstrate that the method
   obtains the highest performance in the joints trajectories prediction,
   compared with Historical Average (HA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving
   Average (ARIMA), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). In the case of
   Accuracy, the accuracy of the proposed method is 91.549%, which is
   33.40%, 7.32% and 3.19% higher than that of HA, ARIMA and SVR,
   respectively. The method can effectively predict the joints trajectories
   of multi-linkage robot with uncertain error at the joint, and provide
   theoretical support for further error compensation, obstacle prediction,
   and obstacle avoidance control of robot.

AB Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide pandemic, putting
   millions of people's health and lives in jeopardy. Detecting infected
   patients early on chest computed tomography (CT) is critical in
   combating COVID-19. Harnessing uncertainty-aware consensus-assisted
   multiple instance learning (UC-MIL), we propose to diagnose COVID-19
   using a new bilateral adaptive graph-based (BA-GCN) model that can use
   both 2D and 3D discriminative information in 3D CT volumes with
   arbitrary number of slices. Given the importance of lung segmentation
   for this task, we have created the largest manual annotation dataset so
   far with 7,768 slices from COVID-19 patients, and have used it to train
   a 2D segmentation model to segment the lungs from individual slices and
   mask the lungs as the regions of interest for the subsequent analyses.
   We then used the UC-MIL model to estimate the uncertainty of each
   prediction and the consensus between multiple predictions on each CT
   slice to automatically select a fixed number of CT slices with reliable
   predictions for the subsequent model reasoning. Finally, we adaptively
   constructed a BA-GCN with vertices from different granularity levels (2D
   and 3D) to aggregate multi-level features for the final diagnosis with
   the benefits of the graph convolution network's superiority to tackle
   cross-granularity relationships. Experimental results on three largest

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the most promising deep learning models
   that can revolutionize non-Euclidean data analysis. However, their full
   potential is severely curtailed by poorly represented molecular graphs
   and features. Here, we propose a multiphysical graph neural network
   (MP-GNN) model based on the developed multiphysical molecular graph
   representation and featurization. All kinds of molecular interactions,
   between different atom types and at different scales, are systematically
   represented by a series of scale-specific and element-specific graphs
   with distance-related node features. From these graphs, graph
   convolution network (GCN) models are constructed with specially designed
   weight-sharing architectures. Base learners are constructed from GCN
   models from different elements at different scales, and further
   consolidated together using both one-scale and multi-scale ensemble
   learning schemes. Our MP-GNN has two distinct properties. First, our
   MP-GNN incorporates multiscale interactions using more than one
   molecular graph. Atomic interactions from various different scales are
   not modeled by one specific graph (as in traditional GNNs), instead they
   are represented by a series of graphs at different scales. Second, it is
   free from the complicated feature generation process as in conventional
   GNN methods. In our MP-GNN, various atom interactions are embedded into
   element-specific graph representations with only distance-related node
   features. A unique GNN architecture is designed to incorporate all the
   information into a consolidated model. Our MP-GNN has been extensively
   validated on the widely used benchmark test datasets from PDBbind,
   including PDBbind-v2007, PDBbind-v2013 and PDBbind-v2016. Our model can
   outperform all existing models as far as we know. Further, our MP-GNN is
   used in coronavirus disease 2019 drug design. Based on a dataset with
   185 complexes of inhibitors for severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2), we evaluate their binding affinities
   using our MP-GNN. It has been found that our MP-GNN is of high accuracy.
   This demonstrates the great potential of our MP-GNN for the screening of
   potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2.

AB Invasion by Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem
   along Chinese coast. Determining the main influential factors and their
   relationships with the distribution of S. alterniflora is thus crucial
   for invasion control. However, the distribution is influenced by
   environmental variables at different scales and the relative importance
   of cross-scale variables is unclear. Based on the MaxEnt modelling
   technique, a combined regional environmental niche (CREN) model was
   built by integrating the global climate niche (GCN) model into the
   regional environment niche (REN) model to study the combined effects of
   global climate suitability and regional environmental variables on
   species distribution. The CREN model performed much better than the GCN
   model with AUC, TSS, specificity and sensitivity values increasing by
   0.12, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.45, whereas it performed as well as the REN
   model, but reduced the overfitting. When considering the combined
   effects, the predicted suitable area decreased from 66.90% at the global
   scale to 18.53% at the regional scale. Global sensitivity analysis
   showed there were strong interactions among different variables,
   especially for elevation and global climate suitability, the most
   influential variables. Interactions reduced the importance of soil
   salinity, but enhanced that of soil percentage sand. The presence
   probability increased with increasing of global climate suitability and
   soil salinity, while decreased with increasing of elevation, soil
   organic carbon and percentage sand. The presence probability was the
   highest in moderately well drained and lowest in poorly drained soil.
   Ignoring the combined effects of cross-scale variables will prevent
   comprehensive elucidation of their relationship with species
   distribution, which should be considered to take effective measures
   against biological invasion.

AB Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease. In
   2018, about 10 million people has been diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB)
   worldwide. Early diagnosis of TB is necessary for effective treatment,
   higher survival rate, and preventing its further transmission. The gold
   standard for tuberculosis diagnosis is sputum culture. Nevertheless,
   posterior-anterior chest radiographs (CXR) is an effective central
   method with low cost and a relatively low radiation dose for screening
   TB with immediate results. TB diagnosis from CXR is a challenging task
   requiring high level of expertise due to the diverse presentation of the
   disease. Significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity in
   CXR images makes TB diagnosis from CXR a more challenging task. The main
   aim of this study is tuberculosis recognition from CXR images for
   reducing the disease burden. For this purpose, a novel multi-instance
   classification model is proposed in this study which is based on CNNs,
   complex networks and stacked ensemble (CCNSE). A main advantage of CCNSE
   is not requiring an accurate lung segmentation to localize the
   suspicious regions. Several overlapping patches are extracted from each
   CXR image. Features describing each patch are obtained by CNNs and then
   the feature vectors are clustered. Local complex networks (LCN) and
   global ones (GCN) of the cluster representatives are formed and feature
   engineering on LCN (GCN) generates other features at image-level
   (patch-level and image-level). Global clustering on these feature sets
   is performed for all patches. Each patch is assigned the purity score of
   its corresponding cluster. Patch-level features and purity scores are
   aggregated for each image. Finally, the images are classified with a
   proposed stacked ensemble classifier to normal and TB classes. Two
   datasets are used in this study including Montgomery County CXR set (MC)
   and Shenzhen dataset (SZ). MC/SZ includes 138/662 chest X-rays (CXR)
   from which 80 and 58/326 and 336 images belong to normal/TB classes,
   respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   with AUC of 99.00 +/- 0.28/98.00 +/- 0.16 for MC/SZ and accuracy of
   99.26 +/- 0.40/99.22 +/- 0.32 for MC/SZ with fivefold cross validation
   strategy is superior than the compared ones for diagnosis of TB from CXR
   images. The proposed method can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis
   system to reduce the manual time, effort and dependency to specialist's
   expertise level.

AB OBJECTIVE: To propose a coupled convolutional and graph convolutional
   network (CCGCN) model for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its
   prodromal stage.
   METHODS: The disease-related brain regions generated by group-wise
   comparison were used as the input. The convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) were used to extract disease-related features from different
   locations on brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. The generated
   features via the graph convolutional network (GCN) were processed, and
   graph pooling was performed to analyze the inherent relationship between
   the brain topology and the diagnosis task adaptively. Through ADNI
   dataset, we acquired the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the
   diagnosis tasks for AD and its prodromal stages, followed by an ablation
   study on the model structure.
   RESULTS: The CCGCN model outperformed the current state-of-the-art
   methods and showed a classification accuracy of 92.5% for AD with a
   sensitivity of 88.1% and a specificity of 96.0%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the structural and topological features of the
   brain MR images, the proposed CCGCN model shows excellent performance in
   AD diagnosis and is expected to provide important assistance to
   physicians in disease diagnosis.

AB Research on the relationship between drugs and targets is the key to
   precision medicine. Ion channel is a kind of important drug targets.
   Aiming at the urgent needs of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   treatment and drug development, this paper designed a mixed graph
   network model to predict the affinity between ion channel targets of
   COVID-19 and drugs. According to the simplified molecular input line
   entry specification (SMILES) code of drugs, firstly, the atomic features
   were extracted to construct the point sets, and edge sets were
   constructed according to atomic bonds. Then the undirected graph with
   atomic features was generated by RDKit tool and the graph attention
   layer was used to extract the drug feature information. Five ion channel
   target proteins were screened from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
   of NCBI database, and the protein features were extracted by convolution
   neural network (CNN). Using attention mechanism and graph convolutional
   network (GCN), the extracted drug features and target features
   information were connected. After two full connection layers operation,
   the drug-target affinity was output, and model was obtained. Kiba
   dataset was used to train the model and determine the model parameters.
   Compared with DeepDTA,WideDTA, graph attention network (GAT),GCN and
   graph isomorphism network (GIN) models, it was proved that the mean
   square error (MSE) of the proposed model was decreased by 0.055, 0.04,
   0.001, 0.046, 0.013 and the consistency index (CI) was increased by
   0.028, 0.016, 0.003, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. It can predict the
   drug-target affinity more accurately. According to the prediction
   results of drug-target affinity of SARS-CoV-2 ion channel targets, seven
   kinds of small molecule drugs acting on five ion channel targets were
   obtained, namely SCH-47112, Dehydroaltenusin, alternariol 5-o-sulfate,
   LPA1 antagonist 1, alternariol, butin, and AT-9283.These drugs provide a
   reference for drug repositioning and precise treatment of COVID-19.

AB Background. Multivariate time series data generally contains missing
   values, which can be an obstacle to subsequent analysis and may
   compromise downstream applications. One challenge in this endeavor is
   the presence of the missing values brought about by sensor failure and
   transmission packet loss. Imputation is the usual remedy in such
   circumstances. However, in some multivariate time series data, the
   complex correlation and temporal dependencies, coupled with the
   non-stationarity of the data, make imputation difficult.
   Methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel model for
   multivariate time series imputation called CGCNImp that considers both
   correlation and temporal dependency modeling. The correlation dependency
   module leverages neural Granger causality and a GCN to capture the
   correlation dependencies among different attributes of the time series
   data, while the temporal dependency module relies on an attention-driven
   long short term memory (LSTM) and a time lag matrix to learn its
   dependencies. Missing values and noise are addressed with total
   variation reconstruction.
   Results. We conduct thorough empirical analyses on two real-world
   datasets. Imputation results show that CGCNImp achieves state-of-the-art
   performance when compared to previous methods.

   information, so its analysis is important for blockchain text mining.
   Previous works focus on analyze homogeneous objects and relations. The
   main problem, however, is these works do not take into account the
   heterogeneity of information. This paper presents a new methodology for
   whitepapers analysis by designing heterogeneous graph neural network,
   named S-HGNN. In detail, this paper first builds a Heterogeneous
   Information Network (HIN) using heterogeneous objects and relationships
   extracted from the whitepaper to obtain similarity measures, then uses
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to
   integrate both structural information and internal semantic into the
   whitepaper embedding. Compared with the previous models, this model
   improves 0.96%similar to 33.34% in terms of F1-score for classification
   task, and 4.94%similar to 14.14% in terms of purity for clustering task,
   and gets stable results on different tasks. The results show the
   effectiveness and robustness of this model for whitepapers analysis. (C)

AB Nowadays, tourists increasingly prefer to check the reviews of
   attractions before traveling to decide whether to visit them or not. To
   respond to the change in the way tourists choose attractions, it is
   important to classify the reviews of attractions with high precision. In
   addition, more and more tourists like to use emojis to express their
   satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the attractions. In this paper, we
   built a dataset for Chinese attraction evaluation incorporating emojis
   (CAEIE) and proposed an explicitly n-gram masking method to enhance the
   integration of coarse-grained information into a pre-training
   (ERNIE-Gram) and Text Graph Convolutional Network (textGCN) (E2G) model
   to classify the dataset with a high accuracy. The E2G preprocesses the
   text and feeds it to ERNIE-Gram and TextGCN. ERNIE-Gram was trained
   using its unique mask mechanism to obtain the final probabilities.
   TextGCN used the dataset to construct heterogeneous graphs with comment
   text and words, which were trained to obtain a representation of the
   document output category probabilities. The two probabilities were
   calculated to obtain the final results. To demonstrate the validity of
   the E2G model, this paper was compared with advanced models. After
   experiments, it was shown that E2G had a good classification effect on
   the CAEIE dataset, and the accuracy of classification was up to 97.37%.
   Furthermore, the accuracy of E2G was 1.37% and 1.35% ahead of ERNIE-Gram
   and TextGCN, respectively. In addition, two sets of comparison
   experiments were conducted to verify the performance of TextGCN and
   TextGAT on the CAEIE dataset. The final results showed that ERNIE and
   ERNIE-Gram combined TextGCN and TextGAT, respectively, and TextGCN
   performed 1.6% and 2.15% ahead. This paper compared the effects of eight
   activation functions on the second layer of the TextGCN and the
   activation-function-rectified linear unit 6 (RELU6) with the best
   results based on experiments.

AB This paper proposes a deep model-based entity alignment method for the
   edge-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) to resolve the semantic
   heterogeneity between the edge systems' data. To do so, this paper first
   analyzes the edge-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) to find unique
   characteristics. The deep model-based entity alignment method is
   developed based on their unique characteristics. The proposed method
   performs the entity alignment using a graph which is not topological but
   data-centric, to reflect the characteristics of the edge-specific KGs,
   which are mainly composed of the instance entities rather than the
   conceptual entities. In addition, two deep models, namely BERT
   (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) for the
   concept entities and GAN (generative adversarial networks) for the
   instance entities, are applied to model learning. By utilizing the deep
   models, neural network models that humans cannot interpret, it is
   possible to secure data on the edge systems. The two learning models
   trained separately are integrated using a graph-based deep learning
   model GCN (graph convolution network). Finally, the integrated deep
   model is utilized to align the entities in the edge-specific KGs. To
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we perform the
   experiment and evaluation compared to the state-of-the-art entity
   alignment methods with the two experimental datasets from DBpedia, YAGO,
   and wikidata. In the evaluation metrics of Hits@k, mean rank (MR), and
   mean reciprocal rank (MRR), the proposed method shows the best
   predictive and generalization performance for the KG entity alignment.

AB Heart rate (HR) is a critical signal for reflecting human physical and
   mental conditions, and it is beneficial for diagnosing neurological and
   cardiovascular diseases due to its excellent accessibility. However,
   traditional HR measurement devices have limited usability and
   convenience. Recent studies have shown that the optical absorption
   variation of human skin due to blood volume variation in cardiac cycles
   can be acquired from facial videos and used to estimate HR in a
   noncontact manner. However, the advanced noncontact HR estimation
   approaches are based on a single HR information source, resulting in
   unsatisfactory estimation results due to noise corruption and
   insufficient information. To address these problems, this article
   proposes a multimodal information fusion framework for noncontact HR
   estimation. First, feature representation maps are used to effectively
   extract periodic signals from facial visible-light and thermal infrared
   videos. Then, a temporal-information-aware HR feature extraction network
   (THR-Net) for encoding discriminative spatiotemporal information from
   the representation maps is presented. Finally, based on a graph
   convolution network (GCN), an information fusion model is proposed for
   feature integration and HR estimation. Experimental and evaluation
   results of five different metrics on two datasets show that the proposed
   approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. This article
   demonstrates the advantage of multimodal information fusion for
   noncontact HR estimation.

AB Cancer subtype classification helps us to understand the pathogenesis of
   cancer and develop new cancer drugs, treatment from which patients would
   benefit most. Most previous studies detect cancer subtypes by extracting
   features from individual samples, ignoring their associations with
   others. We believe that the interactions of cancer samples can help
   identify cancer subtypes. This work proposes a cancer subtype
   classification method based on a residual graph convolutional network
   and a sample similarity network. First, we constructed a sample
   similarity network regarding cancer gene co-expression patterns. Then,
   the gene expression profiles of cancer samples as initial features and
   the sample similarity network were passed into a two-layer graph
   convolutional network (GCN) model. We introduced the initial features to
   the GCN model to avoid over-smoothing during the training process.
   Finally, the classification of cancer subtypes was obtained through a
   softmax activation function. Our model was applied to breast invasive
   carcinoma (BRCA), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lung cancer (LUNG)
   datasets. The accuracy values of our model reached 82.58%, 85.13% and
   79.18% for BRCA, GBM and LUNG, respectively, which outperformed the
   existing methods. The survival analysis of our results proves the
   significant clinical features of the cancer subtypes identified by our
   model. Moreover, we can leverage our model to detect the essential genes
   enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms and the biological pathways related
   to a cancer subtype.

AB In industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the space-time data prediction
   algorithm is considered as one of the key technologies for supporting
   real-time monitoring and intelligent control. However, the complexity of
   existing algorithms is too high to be deployed on edge devices with
   limited computational capability. To solve this problem, a novel
   space-time data prediction algorithm based on knowledge distillation
   (KD-ST) is proposed to compress teacher network to multi-student
   networks. Specifically, generative adversarial network (GAN)
   discrimination and teacher outlier elimination (TOE) are developed to
   minimize the discrepancy between disparate networks and avoid training
   errors. Furthermore, a weight transfer strategy is adopted for saving
   training time. Experiment results demonstrate that compared with the
   state-of-the-art T-GCN, the proposed Transfer-LSTM improves the
   real-time response speed by 17.15 times, and the proposed Transfer-1DCNN

AB In this study, to overcome the low charge transportation efficiency and
   poor visible light absorption ability, and achieve highly efficient
   photocatalytic applications, carbon nitride nanosheets with oxygen and
   carbon co-doping were successfully designed and fabricated. The
   resultant carbon nitride nanosheets exhibited efficient photocatalytic
   H-2 evolution and CO2 reduction performance, highlighting the efficacy
   of such a strategy. The highest H-2 evolution rate could reach 698.43 mu
   mol g(-1) h(-1), higher than that for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN).
   For CO2 reduction, the photocatalytic system shows a high CO
   selectivity, and MG(3.0) achieves the largest CO generation amount of
   55.2 mu mol g(-1). This enhanced photocatalytic reduction performance
   could be attributed to oxygen and carbon co-doping, which achieves fast
   electron extraction and transfer, and improved visible light absorption
   ability. It should be noted that the excessive addition of glucose in
   the synthesis process could enhance conductivity and promote visible
   light absorption of carbon nitride, but suppress the H-2 evolution and
   CO2 reduction ability. Simultaneously, the photocatalytic reduction
   mechanism is discussed. This work confirms that a carbon nitride
   semiconductor with oxygen and carbon co-doping could be easily prepared
   by this strategy, achieving efficient photocatalytic applications.

AB Analyzing fish shoal behaviors is one of the concerned problems for
   scientists who study fish welfare and stress. However, most shoal
   behavior exploring methods with manual parameters are subjective and not
   widely available in various conditions. Therefore, this study introduced
   graph technology, built 29,505 shoal behavioral graphs and presented a
   graph neural network for analyzing four shoal behaviors (normal,
   resting, abnormal, and circular state) by calculating the multiple
   swimming indexes and swimming posture from videos. In the proposed
   model, motion characteristics of the shoal and swimming posture of
   individuals in shoal were utilized to construct a shoal graph, and then
   the graph convolution network (GCN) model was trained and tested.
   Results indicated that the model could effectively improve the
   identification rate of fish shoals' special behaviors, with an overall
   accuracy of 97.3% under the ideal condition, 92.3% for the practicable
   scheme that track fish by machine learning technology, compared with the
   artificial neural network, modified kinetic energy model and simulation
   feature point selection model, the accuracy of special behaviors
   increased by 1.6%, 57.7%, and 34.0%, respectively. Besides, the main
   factors that affected the accuracy of the analyzer were explored. The
   analyzer is sensitive to (1) the precision of tracking results, (2) edge
   connection in the graph and (3) features of the model's input. In
   addition, by interpreting the principle of the GCN model, it assigns
   greater weights for dispersion in normal swimming state recognition, and
   swimming postures are the most significant indicators to determine
   whether a shoal is in an abnormal state or not. In summary, the model
   can be used to help researchers explore the basal behavioral mechanisms
   in aquaculture.

AB Forecasting human poses given a sequence of historical pose frames has
   several important applications, especially in the domain of smart home
   safety. Recently, computer vision-based human pose forecasting has made
   a breakthrough using deep learning technology. However, to implement a
   practical system deployed on an IoT edge environment, there are still
   two issues to be addressed. First, existing methods on pose forecasting
   fail to model the coherent structural information of connected human
   joints and thus cannot achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy,
   especially for long-term predictions. Second, a general and static
   pre-trained prediction model may not perform well in the deployment
   environment due to the visual domain shift problem. In this article, we
   propose a hybrid cloud-edge system called GPFS to solve those issues.
   Specifically, we first introduce a novel graph convolutional neural
   network (GCN)-based sequence-to-sequence learning method, which enhances
   the sequence encoder by using a graph to represent both the spatial and
   temporal connections of the human joints in the input frames. The GCN
   improves the forecasting accuracy by capturing the motion pattern of
   each joint as well as the correlations among different human joints over
   time. Second, to address the domain shift issue and protect data
   privacy, we extend the system to perform online learning on the IoT edge
   to adapt the cloud trained general model with online collected on-site
   domain data. Extensive evaluation on Human 3.6M and Penn Action datasets
   demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system.

AB The accurate forecasting of urban taxi demands, which is a hot topic in
   intelligent transportation research, is challenging due to the
   complicated spatial-temporal dependencies, the dynamic nature, and the
   uncertainty of traffic. To make full use of the global and local
   correlations between traffic flows on road sections, this paper presents
   a deep learning model based on a graph convolutional network, long
   short-term memory (LSTM), and multitask learning. First, an undirected
   graph model was formed by considering the spatial pattern distribution
   of taxi trips on road networks. Then, LSTMs were used to extract the
   temporal features of traffic flows. Finally, the model was trained using
   a multitask learning strategy to improve the model's generalizability.
   In the experiments, the efficiency and accuracy were verified with
   real-world taxi trajectory data. The experimental results showed that
   the model could effectively forecast the short-term taxi demands on the
   traffic network level and outperform state-of-the-art traffic prediction
   methods.

AB The human finger is the essential carrier of biometric features. The
   finger itself contains multi-modal traits, including fingerprint and
   finger-vein, which provides convenience and practicality for finger
   bi-modal fusion recognition. The scale inconsistency and feature space
   mismatch of finger bi-modal images are important reasons for the fusion
   effect. The feature extraction method based on graph structure can well
   solve the problem of feature space mismatch for the finger
   bi-modalities, and the end-to-end fusion recognition can be realised
   based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). However, this
   fusion recognition strategy based on GCNs still has two urgent problems:
   first, lack of stable and efficient graph fusion method; second,
   over-smoothing problem of GCNs will lead to the degradation of
   recognition performance. A novel fusion method is proposed to integrate
   the graph features of fingerprint (FP) and finger-vein (FV).
   Furthermore, we analyse the inner relationship between the information
   transmission process and the over-smoothing problem in GCNs from an
   optimisation perspective, and point out that the differentiated
   information between neighbouring nodes decreases as the number of layers
   increases, which is the direct reason for the over-smoothing problem. A
   modified deep graph convolution neural network is proposed, aiming to
   alleviate the over-smoothing problem. The intuition is that the
   differentiated features of the nodes should be properly preserved to
   ensure the uniqueness of the nodes themselves. Thus, a constraint term
   to the objective function of the GCN is added to emphasise the
   differentiation features of the nodes themselves. The experimental
   results show that the proposed fusion method can achieve more satisfied
   performance in finger bi-modal biometric recognition, and the proposed
   constrained GCN can well alleviate the problem of over-smoothing.

AB COVID-19 has caused severe threats to lives and damage to property
   worldwide. The immunopathology of the disease is of particular concern.
   Currently, researchers have used gene co-expression networks (GCNs) to
   deepen the study of molecular mechanisms of immune responses to
   COVID-19. However, most efforts have not fully explored dynamic changes
   of cell-type-specific molecular networks in the disease process. This
   study proposes a GCN construction pipeline named single-cell Disease
   Progression cellular module analysis (scDisProcema), which can trace
   dynamic changes of immune system response during disease progression
   using single-cell data. Here, scDisProcema considers changes in cell
   fate and expres-sion patterns during disease development, identifying
   gene modules responsible for different immune cells. The hub genes are
   screened for each module by the specific expression level and the
   intercellular connectivity of modules. Based on functional items
   enriched by each gene module, we elucidate the bio-logical processes of
   different cells involved in disease development and explain the
   molecular mecha-nisms underlying the process of cell depletion or
   proliferation caused by disease. Compared with traditional WGCNA
   methods, scDisProcema can make more convenient use of the heterogeneity
   informa-tion provided by scRNA-seq data and has great potential in
   exploring molecular changes during disease progression and organ
   development. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

AB Predicting disease progression in the initial stage to implement early
   intervention and treatment can effectively prevent the further
   deterioration of the condition. Traditional methods for medical data
   analysis usually fail to perform well because of their incapability for
   mining the correlation pattern of pathogenies. Therefore, many
   calculation methods have been excavated from the field of deep learning.
   In this study, we propose a novel method of influence hypergraph
   convolutional generative adversarial network (IHGC-GAN) for disease risk
   prediction. First, a hypergraph is constructed with genes and brain
   regions as nodes. Then, an influence transmission model is built to
   portray the associations between nodes and the transmission rule of
   disease information. Third, an IHGC-GAN method is constructed based on
   this model. This method innovatively combines the graph convolutional
   network (GCN) and GAN. The GCN is used as the generator in GAN to spread
   and update the lesion information of nodes in the brain region-gene
   hypergraph. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the method is improved
   by the mutual competition and repeated iteration between generator and
   discriminator. This method can not only capture the evolutionary pattern
   from early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) to late MCI (LMCI) but also
   extract the pathogenic factors and predict the deterioration risk from
   EMCI to LMCI. The results on the two datasets indicate that the IHGC-GAN
   method has better prediction performance than the advanced methods in a
   variety of indicators.

TI Integrating reviews and ratings into graph neural networks for rating

AB In the area of recommendation systems, one of the fundamental tasks is
   rating prediction. Most existing neural network methods independently
   extract user's and item's review features utilizing a parallel
   convolutional neural network(CNN) and use them as the representation of
   users and items to predict rating scores. There are two main drawbacks
   of these methods: (1) They typically only leverage user or item reviews
   but ignore the latent information provided by user-item interactions.
   (2) The historical rating scores are not integrated into the
   representation of users and items, they are simply used as labels to
   train models. Thus the rating information is not adequately utilized,
   leading to the prediction performance of these methods is not superior.
   To remedy these drawbacks mentioned above, in this paper, we build a
   unified graph convolutional network(GCN) to capture the interaction
   information between user and item, also obtain additional information
   provided by reviews and rating scores. As both reviews and ratings carry
   interactive messages among users and items, they would magnify the
   learning performance of user-item features. Specifically, we first
   construct a multi-attributed bipartite graph(MA-bipartite graph) to
   represent users, items, and their interactions through reviews and
   ratings. Then we divide the MA-bipartite graph into two sub-graphs
   according to the attributes of the edge types which represent the
   user-item interaction in review domain and item domain respectively.
   Next, an attributed GCN model is explicitly designed to learn latent
   features of users and items by incorporating review embeddings and
   rating score weights. Finally, the attention mechanism is carried to
   fuse user and item features dynamically to conduct the rating
   prediction. We conduct our experiments on two real-world datasets. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved the
   state-of-the-art performance, which increases the prediction accuracy by
   more than 3%, compared with baseline methods.

AB With the rise of artificial intelligence, deep learning has become the
   main research method of pedestrian recognition re-identification
   (re-id). However, most of the existing researches usually just determine
   the retrieval order based on the geographical location of cameras, which
   ignore the spatio-temporal logic characteristics of pedestrian flow.
   Furthermore, most of these methods rely on common object detection to
   detect and match pedestrians directly, which will separate the logical
   connection between videos from different cameras. In this research, a
   novel pedestrian re-identification model assisted by logical topological
   inference is proposed, which includes: 1) a joint optimization mechanism
   of pedestrian re-identification and multicamera logical topology
   inference, which makes the multicamera logical topology provides the
   retrieval order and the confidence for re-identification. And meanwhile,
   the results of pedestrian re-identification as a feedback modify logical
   topological inference; 2) a dynamic spatio-temporal information driving
   logical topology inference method via conditional probability graph
   convolution network (CPGCN) with random forest-based transition
   activation mechanism (RF-TAM) is proposed, which focuses on the
   pedestrian's walking direction at different moments; and 3) a pedestrian
   group cluster graph convolution network (GC-GCN) is designed to measure
   the correlation between embedded pedestrian features. Some experimental
   analyses and real scene experiments on datasets CUHK-SYSU, PRW, SLP, and
   UJS-reID indicate that the designed model can achieve a better logical
   topology inference with an accuracy of 87.3% and achieve the top-1
   accuracy of 77.4% and the mAP accuracy of 74.3% for pedestrian
   re-identification.

AB Topic modeling on tweets is known to experience under-specificity and
   data sparsity due to its character limitation. In earlier studies,
   researchers attempted to address this problem by either 1) tweet
   aggregation, where related tweets are combined into a single document or
   2) tweet expansion with related text from external sources. The first
   approach faces the problem of losing the topic distribution in
   individual tweets. While finding a relevant text from the external
   source for a random tweet in the second approach is challenging for
   various reasons like differences in writing styles, multilingual
   content, and informal text. In contrast to adding context from external
   resources or combining related tweets into a pool, this study uses the
   internal vocabulary (hashtags) to counter under-specificity and sparsity
   in tweets. Earlier studies have indicated hashtags to be an important
   feature for representing the underlying context present in the tweet.
   Sequential models like Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)
   and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) over distributed representation of
   words have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships
   between words of a tweet in the past. Motivated by the above, this
   article proposes a unified framework of hashtag-based tweet expansion
   exploiting text-based and network-based representation learning methods
   such as BiLSTM, BERT, and Graph Convolution Network (GCN). The
   hashtag-based expanded tweets using the proposed framework have
   significantly improved topic modeling performance compared to
   un-expanded (raw) tweets and hashtag-pooling-based approaches over two
   real-world tweet datasets of different nature. Furthermore, this article
   also studies the significance of hashtags in topic modeling performance
   by experimenting with different combination of word types such as
   hashtags, keywords, and user mentions.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed single-stranded RNA
   molecules, which have many biological functions. Previous experiments
   have shown that circRNAs are involved in numerous biological processes,
   especially regulatory functions. It has also been found that circRNAs
   are associated with complex diseases of human beings. Therefore,
   predicting the associations of circRNA with disease (called
   circRNA-disease associations) is useful for disease prevention,
   diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we propose a novel computational
   approach called GGCDA based on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict circRNA-disease
   associations. Firstly, GGCDA combines circRNA sequence similarity,
   disease semantic similarity and corresponding Gaussian interaction
   profile kernel similarity, and then a random walk with restart algorithm
   (RWR) is used to obtain the preliminary features of circRNA and disease.
   Secondly, a heterogeneous graph is constructed from the known
   circRNA-disease association network and the calculated similarity of
   circRNAs and diseases. Thirdly, the multi-head Graph Attention Network
   (GAT) is adopted to obtain different weights of circRNA and disease
   features, and then GCN is employed to aggregate the features of adjacent
   nodes in the network and the features of the nodes themselves, so as to
   obtain multi-view circRNA and disease features. Finally, we combined a
   multi-layer fully connected neural network to predict the associations
   of circRNAs with diseases. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods,
   GGCDA can achieve AUC values of 0.9625 and 0.9485 under the results of
   fivefold cross-validation on two datasets, and AUC of 0.8227 on the
   independent test set. Case studies further demonstrate that our approach
   is promising for discovering potential circRNA-disease associations.

AB The weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods for
   image-level labels are among the most popular research topics. The
   current WSSS methods mainly generate the class activation map (CAM)
   regions so as to create the pseudo segmentation label seed. However, the
   sparsity of seed leads to less accurate local discriminative regions.
   Therefore, in this paper a non-bias self -attention learning
   segmentation network (NBSA) is proposed. First, the non-bias layer is
   designed to guide the network to expand the discriminative field of CAM
   during the training process. Second, a fine-grained learning
   strategy-the information enhancement module (IEM) is intro-duced to
   construct the graph convolutional network (GCN) for inter-semantic
   self-attention learning, which can further improve the generalization
   ability of the model. Experiments were show that on the PASCAL VOC 2012
   dataset to compare the performances of our method with others, the
   results demonstrates that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art
   performance.

AB Increasing evidence shows that the occurrence of human complex diseases
   is closely related to the mutation and abnormal expression of
   microRNAs(miRNAs). MiRNAs have complex and fine regulatory mechanisms,
   which makes it a promising target for drug discovery and disease
   diagnosis. Therefore, predicting the potential miRNA-disease
   associations has practical significance. In this paper, we proposed an
   miRNA-disease association predicting method based on multiple kernel
   fusion on Graph Convolutional Network via Initial residual and Identity
   mapping (GCNII), called MKFGCNII. Firstly, we built a heterogeneous
   network of miRNAs and diseases to extract multi-layer features via
   GCNII. Secondly, multiple kernel fusion method was applied to weight
   fusion of embeddings at each layer. Finally, Dual Laplacian Regularized
   Least Squares was used to predict new miRNA-disease associations by the
   combined kernel in miRNA and disease spaces. Compared with the other
   methods, MKFGCNII obtained the highest AUC value of 0.9631. Code is

AB The commonly-used large-scale knowledge bases have been facing
   challenges in open domain question answering tasks which are caused by
   the loose knowledge association and weak structural logic of

   proposes a novel metaknowledge enhanced approach for open domain
   question answering. We design an automatic approach to extract
   metaknowledge and build a metaknowledge network from Wiki documents. For
   the purpose of representing the directional weighted graph with
   hierarchical and semantic features, we present an original graph encoder
   GE4MK to model the metaknowledge network. Then, a metaknowledge enhanced
   graph reasoning model MEGr-Net is proposed for question answering, which
   aggregates both relational and neighboring interactions comparing with
   R-GCN and GAT. Experiments have proved the improvement of metaknowledge
   over main-stream triplet-based knowledge. We have found that the graph
   reasoning models and pre-trained language models also have influences on
   the metaknowledge enhanced question answering approaches.

AB The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of gCN can be enhanced by
   modifying its photocatalytic properties, which has been considered as a
   typical challenging agent for water splitting. Here, we present a study
   of metal-free surface charge transfer doping (SCTD) of g-CN films by
   means of surface alteration treatment and accordingly demonstrated its
   influence on the PEC performance by combining experiments and
   theoretical calculations. The as-prepared doped films using a boron
   dopant boost the photocurrent density by a factor of 3 versus RHE with
   no sacrificial reagents as compared to pristine g-CN films. The boron
   dopant can readily substitute the nitrogen atom when the film is coated
   five times and, consequently, reduce the band gap by raising the valence
   band edge. We conjecture that such improvement is due to the effective
   SCTD and enhanced charge carrier separation, which are beneficial for
   improving charge migration, charge mobility, space charge region, and
   recombination rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare
   neuromuscular disorder characterized by late-onset development of
   bilateral eyelid ptosis, ophthalmoparesis and dysphagia with further
   progression to proximal limb muscle weakness that is an under recognized
   condition. The mode of inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, but a
   recessive form has been reported. OPMD is caused by a short expansion of
   the alanine repeat (GCN trinucleotide) in the poly(adenylate)-binding
   protein nuclear1 (PABPN1) gene.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of undiagnosed cases that
   initially presented with ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, muscle weakness,
   muscular dystrophy and/or myasthenia gravis from 2000 to 2015 at two
   institutions in Southern California.
   RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were identified to have OPMD with genetic
   confirmation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even though a rare condition, the prevalence is
   disproportionally frequent in certain ethnic groups and in certain
   regions; thus, we report our experience of OPMD patients in Southern
   California.

AB In the past two years, various graph convolution neural networks (GCNs)
   accelerators have emerged, each with their own characteristics, but
   their common disadvantage is that the hardware architecture is not

   They may not support acceleration for different GCNs and may not achieve

   Therefore, given the above shortcomings, and according to the

   proposes and implements GPGCN: a general-purpose GCNs accelerator
   architecture based on RISC-V instruction set extension, providing the
   software programming freedom to support acceleration for various GCNs,
   and achieving the best acceleration efficiency for different GCNs with

   with vector expansion, GPGCN achieves above 1001 x, 267 x speedup for
   GCN with the Cora dataset. Compared with dedicated accelerators, GPGCN
   has software programmability and supports the acceleration of more GCNs.

AB We use the first principle calculation to investigate the intrinsic
   magnetism of graphitic carbon nitrides (GCNs). By preserving three-fold
   symmetry, the GCN building blocks have been built out of different
   combinations between 6 components which are C atom, N atom, s-triazine,
   heptazine, heptazine with C atom at the center, and benzimidazole-like
   component. That results in 20 phases where 11 phases have been
   previously reported, and 9 phases are newly derived. The partial density
   of states and charge density have been analyzed through 20 phases to
   understand the origin of the presence and absence of intrinsic magnetism
   in GCNs. The intrinsic magnetism will be present not only because the
   GCNs comprising of radical components but also the pi-conjugated states
   are not the valence maximum to break the delocalization of unpaired
   electrons. The building blocks are also employed to study alloys between
   g-C3N4 and g-C4N3. The magnetization of the alloys has been found to be
   linearly dependent on a number of C atoms in the unit cell and some
   magnetic alloys are energetically favorable. Moreover, the intrinsic
   magnetism in GCNs can be promoted or demoted by passivating with a H
   atom depending on the passivated positions.

AB Pt is usually used as cocatalyst for g-C3N4 to produce H-2 by
   photocatalytic splitting of water. However, the photocatalytic
   performance is still limited by the fast recombination of
   photo-generated electrons and holes, as well as the poor absorption of
   visible light. In this work, MoO2/g-C3N4 composites were prepared, in
   which MoO2 synergetic with Pt photo-deposited during H-2 evolution
   reaction worked as unilateral dual cocatalyst to improve the
   photocatalytic activity. Within 4 hours of irradiation, the hydrogen
   production rate of MoO2-Pt dual cocatalyst modified g-C3N4 reached
   3804.89 mu mol/g/h, which was 120.18 times of that of pure g-C3N4 (GCN,
   31.66 mu mol/g/h), 10.98 times of that of MoO2 modified g-C3N4 (346.39
   mu mol/g/h), and 9.18 times of that of Pt modified g-C3N4 (413.64 mu
   mol/g/h). Characterization results demonstrate that the deficient MoO2
   not only promoted visible light absorption of g-C3N4, but also worked as
   a "electron pool" to capture and transfer electrons to Pt.

AB The aspect-level sentiment analysis is widely used in public opinion
   analysis. However, the problem of context information loss and
   distortion with the increase of the model depth is rarely considered in
   previous research. Few studies have attempted to combine the feature
   extracted from different embedding models. Based on the correction
   strategy, the ensemble correction (EC) model proposed in this study can
   correct context information loss and distortion. Based on the ensemble
   learning strategy and the weight sharing strategy, EC can extract
   features from different word embedding models and can reduce
   computational complexity. Experiments on the resturant14, laptop14,
   resturant16 and twitter datasets show that the accuracies of the EC
   model are 0.8848, 0.8213, 0.9301 and 0.7731, respectively. The accuracy
   of the EC model is higher than state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies
   and case studies are used to verify the model structure. The optimal
   number of graph convolutional network (GCN) layers is also verified.

AB The narrow band-gap and long life-time of photo-generated charges endow
   CdS with much higher photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) activity
   over other photocatalysts. Thus, CdS based materials are considered to
   be most promising photocatalysts for PHE activity and stability. In this
   work, graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) is used as sacrifice agent to
   synthesize is nitrogen and carbon co-doped CdS nanoparticles with of
   uniform small size and higher specific surface area via hydrothermal
   reaction. Besides, co-doping of nitrogen and especially carbon leads to
   electron penetration to CdS results in tuned band structure of doped CdS
   with down-shifted conducting band and valance band positions. Moreover,
   the doped heteroatoms act as charge trapping centers that enhance charge
   separation within CdS particles endowing their photo-generated charges
   with longer life-time in compared with that of bare CdS. Benefited from
   non-metallic heteroatoms doping, obviously increased PHE activity and
   stability of CdS under visible light irradiation are achieved.

AB Benzyl alcohol and a set ofpara-substituted derivatives (-NO2, -Cl,
   -CH3, -OCH3 and -OH) were converted to the corresponding aldehydes in a
   commercial continuous-flow microfluidic reactor. Due to the dimension
   and the rigidity of the commercial microfluidic reactor channels, a
   stable suspension with few-layer graphitic carbon nitride nanoparticles
   (GCN-TS) was used to avoid the blockage of the photocatalyst in the
   channels of the reactor. Preliminary photocatalytic batch experiments
   revealed that different reaction yields were obtained depending on the
   aromatic ring activating/deactivating nature of the substituent groups.
   Regarding the ex-periments under continuous-flow, the highest aldehyde
   production was obtained for the reactions with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol
   as starting molecule, corresponding to 0.19 mM at a retention time of
   merely 0.75 min. The results show the possibility of employing
   microfluidic reactors for the selective photocatalytic conversion of
   aromatic alcohols for both process intensification and screening
   applications due to the drastic decrease of reaction time.

AB The performance of image captioning has been significantly improved
   recently through deep neural network ar-chitectures combining with
   attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning optimization. Exploring
   visual re-lationships and interactions between different objects
   appearing in the image, however, is far from being investigated. In this
   paper, we present a novel approach that combines scene graphs with
   Transformer, which we call SGT, to explicitly encode available visual
   relationships between detected objects. Specifically, we pretrain an
   scene graph generation model to predict graph representations for
   images. After that, for each graph node, a Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) is employed to acquire relationship knowledge by aggregating the
   informa-tion of its local neighbors. As we train the captioning model,
   we feed the potential relation-aware information into the Transformer to
   generate descriptive sentence. Experiments on the MSCOCO dataset and the
   Flickr30k dataset validate the superiority of our SGT model, which can
   realize state-of-the-art results in terms of all the standard evaluation
   metrics.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To grasp the target object stably and orderly in the object-stacking
   scenes, it is important for the robot to reason the relationships
   between objects and obtain intelligent manipulation order for more
   advanced interaction between the robot and the environment. This paper
   proposes a novel graph-based visual manipulation relationship reasoning
   network (GVMRN) that directly outputs object relationships and
   manipulation order. The GVMRN model first extracts features and detects
   objects from RGB images, and then adopts graph convolutional network
   (GCN) to collect contextual information between objects. To improve the
   efficiency of relation reasoning, a relationship filtering network is
   built to reduce object pairs before reasoning. The experiments on the
   Visual Manipulation Relationship Dataset (VMRD) show that our model
   significantly outperforms previous methods on reasoning object
   relationships in object-stacking scenes. The GVMRN model is also tested
   on the images we collected and applied on the robot grasping platform.
   The results demonstrated the generalization and applicability of our
   method in real environment.

AB The task to extract relations tries to identify relationships between
   two named entities in a sentence. Because a sentence usually contains
   several named entities, capturing structural information of a sentence
   is important to support this task. Currently, graph neural networks are
   widely implemented to support relation extraction, in which dependency
   trees are employed to generate adjacent matrices for encoding structural
   information of a sentence. Because parsing a sentence is error-prone, it
   influences the performance of a graph neural network. On the other hand,
   a sentence is structuralized by several named entities, which precisely
   segment a sentence into several parts. Different features can be
   combined by prior knowledge and experience, which are effective to
   initialize a symmetric adjacent matrix for a graph neural network. Based
   on this phenomenon, we proposed a feature combination-based graph
   convolutional neural network model (FC-GCN). It has the advantages of
   encoding structural information of a sentence, considering prior
   knowledge, and avoiding errors caused by parsing. In the experiments,
   the results show significant improvement, which outperform existing
   state-of-the-art performances.

AB BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious developmental
   disorder of the brain. Recently, various deep learning methods based on
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have been developed
   for the classification of ASD. Among them, graph neural networks, which
   generalize deep neural network models to graph structured data, have
   shown great advantages. However, in graph neural methods, because the
   graphs constructed are homogeneous, the phenotype information of the
   subjects cannot be fully utilized. This affects the improvement of the
   classification performance.MethodsTo fully utilize the phenotype
   information, this paper proposes a heterogeneous graph convolutional
   attention network (HCAN) model to classify ASD. By combining an
   attention mechanism and a heterogeneous graph convolutional network,
   important aggregated features can be extracted in the HCAN. The model
   consists of a multilayer HCAN feature extractor and a multilayer
   perceptron (MLP) classifier. First, a heterogeneous population graph was
   constructed based on the fMRI and phenotypic data. Then, a multilayer
   HCAN is used to mine graph-based features from the heterogeneous graph.
   Finally, the extracted features are fed into an MLP for the final
   classification.ResultsThe proposed method is assessed on the autism
   brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) repository. In total, 871 subjects
   in the ABIDE I dataset are used for the classification task. The best
   classification accuracy of 82.9% is achieved. Compared to the other
   methods using exactly the same subjects in the literature, the proposed
   method achieves superior performance to the best reported
   result.ConclusionsThe proposed method can effectively integrate
   heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with a semantic attention
   mechanism so that the phenotype features of the subjects can be fully
   utilized. Moreover, it shows great potential in the diagnosis of brain
   functional disorders with fMRI data.

AB Featured Application The proposed methodology is a computer vision
   application for monitoring and recognizing human-object interactions and
   has been evaluated over three challenging benchmark datasets. Therefore,
   this technique can be used to develop advanced surveillance and security
   systems to locate human and object targets and classify their
   interactions. The critical task of recognizing human-object interactions
   (HOI) finds its application in the domains of surveillance, security,
   healthcare, assisted living, rehabilitation, sports, and online
   learning. This has led to the development of various HOI recognition
   systems in the recent past. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
   develop a novel graph-based solution for this purpose. In particular,
   the proposed system takes sequential data as input and recognizes the
   HOI interaction being performed in it. That is, first of all, the system
   pre-processes the input data by adjusting the contrast and smoothing the
   incoming image frames. Then, it locates the human and object through
   image segmentation. Based on this, 12 key body parts are identified from
   the extracted human silhouette through a graph-based image
   skeletonization technique called image foresting transform (IFT). Then,
   three types of features are extracted: full-body feature, point-based
   features, and scene features. The next step involves optimizing the
   different features using isometric mapping (ISOMAP). Lastly, the
   optimized feature vector is fed to a graph convolution network (GCN)
   which performs the HOI classification. The performance of the proposed
   system was validated using three benchmark datasets, namely, Olympic
   Sports, MSR Daily Activity 3D, and D3D-HOI. The results showed that this
   model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models by achieving a
   mean accuracy of 94.1% with the Olympic Sports, 93.2% with the MSR Daily
   Activity 3D, and 89.6% with the D3D-HOI datasets.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have been widely used in the field of
   skeleton-based human action recognition. However, it is still difficult
   to improve recognition performance and reduce parameter complexity. In
   this paper, a novel multi-scale attention spatiotemporal GCN (MSA-STGCN)
   is proposed for human violence action recognition by learning
   spatiotemporal features from four different skeleton modality variants.
   Firstly, the original joint data are preprocessed to obtain joint
   position, bone vector, joint motion and bone motion datas as inputs of
   recognition framework. Then, a spatial multi-scale graph convolution
   network based on the attention mechanism is constructed to obtain the
   spatial features from joint nodes, while a temporal graph convolution
   network in the form of hybrid dilation convolution is designed to
   enlarge the receptive field of the feature map and capture multi-scale
   context information. Finally, the specific relationship in the different
   skeleton data is explored by fusing the information of multi-stream
   related to human joints and bones. To evaluate the performance of the
   proposed MSA-STGCN, a skeleton violence action dataset: Filtered NTU
   RGB+D was constructed based on NTU RGB+D120. We conducted experiments on
   constructed Filtered NTU RGB+D and Kinetics Skeleton 400 datasets to
   verify the performance of the proposed recognition framework. The
   proposed method achieves an accuracy of 95.3% on the Filtered NTU RGB+D
   with the parameters 1.21M, and an accuracy of 36.2% (Top-1) and 58.5%
   (Top-5) on the Kinetics Skeleton 400, respectively. The experimental
   results on these two skeleton datasets show that the proposed
   recognition framework can effectively recognize violence actions without
   adding parameters.

AB The perturbations of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were found to
   be the main cause of cancer. Previous PPI prediction methods which were
   trained with non-disease general PPI data were not compatible to map the
   PPI network in cancer. Therefore, we established a novel cancer specific
   PPI prediction method dubbed NECARE, which was based on relational graph
   convolutional network (R-GCN) with knowledge-based features. It achieved
   the best performance with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) =
   0.84 & PLUSMN;0.03 and an F1 = 91 & PLUSMN;2% compared with other
   methods. With NECARE, we mapped the cancer interactome atlas and
   revealed that the perturbations of PPIs were enriched on 1362 genes,
   which were named cancer hub genes. Those genes were found to
   over-represent with mutations occurring at protein-macromolecules
   binding interfaces. Furthermore, over 56% of cancer treatment-related
   genes belonged to hub genes and they were significantly related to the
   prognosis of 32 types of cancers. Finally, by coimmunoprecipitation, we
   confirmed that the NECARE prediction method was highly reliable with a
   90% accuracy. Overall, we provided the novel network-based cancer
   protein-protein interaction prediction method and mapped the
   perturbation of cancer interactome. NECARE is available at:

AB Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is
   increasingly used in oncology, neurology, cardiology, and emerging
   medical fields. The success stems from the cohesive information that
   hybrid PET/CT imaging offers, surpassing the capabilities of individual
   modalities when used in isolation for different malig-nancies. However,
   manual image interpretation requires extensive disease-specific
   knowledge, and it is a time-consuming aspect of physicians' daily
   routines. Deep learning algorithms, akin to a practitioner during
   training, extract knowledge from images to facilitate the diagnosis
   process by detecting symptoms and enhancing images. This acquired
   knowledge aids in supporting the diagnosis process through symptom
   detection and image enhancement. The available review papers on PET/CT
   imaging have a drawback as they either included addi-tional modalities
   or examined various types of AI applications. However, there has been a
   lack of comprehensive investigation specifically focused on the highly
   specific use of AI, and deep learning, on PET/CT images. This review
   aims to fill that gap by investigating the characteristics of approaches
   used in papers that employed deep learning for PET/CT imaging. Within
   the review, we identified 99 studies published between 2017 and 2022
   that applied deep learning to PET/CT images. We also identified the best
   pre-processing algorithms and the most effective deep learning models
   reported for PET/CT while highlighting the current limitations. Our
   review underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) in PET/CT
   imaging, with successful applications in lesion detection, tumor
   segmentation, and disease classification in both sinogram and image
   spaces. Common and specific pre-processing techniques are also
   discussed. DL algorithms excel at extracting meaningful features, and
   enhancing accuracy and efficiency in diagnosis. However, limitations
   arise from the scarcity of annotated datasets and challenges in
   explainability and uncertainty. Recent DL models, such as
   attention-based models, generative models, multi-modal models, graph
   convolutional networks, and transformers, are promising for improving
   PET/CT studies. Additionally, radiomics has garnered attention for tumor
   classification and predicting patient outcomes. Ongoing research is
   crucial to explore new applications and improve the accuracy of DL
   models in this rapidly evolving field.

AB Using unreliable information sources generating conflicting evidence may
   lead to a large uncertainty, which significantly hurts the decision
   making process. Recently, many approaches have been taken to integrate
   conflicting data from multiple sources and/or fusing conflicting
   opinions from different entities. To explicitly deal with uncertainty, a
   belief model called Subjective Logic (SL), as a variant of
   Dumpster-Shafer Theory, has been proposed to represent subjective
   opinions and to merge multiple opinions by offering a rich volume of
   fusing operators, which have been used to solve many opinion inference
   problems in trust networks. However, the operators of SL are known to be
   lack of scalability in inferring unknown opinions from large network
   data as a result of the sequential procedures of merging multiple
   opinions. In addition, SL does not consider deriving opinions in the
   presence of conflicting evidence. In this work, we propose a hybrid
   inference method that combines SL and Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL),
   namely, Collective Subjective Plus, CSL+, which is resistible to highly
   conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence. PSL can reason a belief in a
   collective manner to deal with large-scale network data, allowing high
   scalability based on relationships between opinions. However, PSL does
   not consider an uncertainty dimension in a subjective opinion. To take
   benefits from both SL and PSL, we proposed a hybrid approach called CSL+
   for achieving high scalability and high prediction accuracy for unknown
   opinions with uncertainty derived from a lack of evidence and/or
   conflicting evidence. Through the extensive experiments on four
   semi-synthetic and two real-world datasets, we showed that the CSL+
   outperforms the state-of-the-art belief model (i.e., SL), probabilistic
   inference models (i.e., PSL, CSL), and deep learning model (i.e.,
   GCN-VAE-opinion) in terms of prediction accuracy, computational
   complexity, and real running time.

AB With the rapid economic growth and the continuous increase in
   population, cars have become a necessity for most people to travel. The
   increase in the number of cars is accompanied by serious traffic
   congestion. In order to alleviate traffic congestion, many places have
   introduced policies such as vehicle restriction, and intelligent
   transportation systems have gradually been put into use. Due to the
   chaotic complexity of the traffic road network and the short-term
   mobility of the population, traffic flow prediction is affected by many
   complex factors, and an effective traffic flow forecasting system is
   very challenging. This paper proposes a model to predict the traffic
   flow of Wenyi Road in Hangzhou. Wenyi Road consists of four crossroads.
   The four intersections have the same changing trend in traffic flow at
   the same time, which indicates that the roads influence each other
   spatially, and the traffic flow has spatial and temporal correlation.
   Based on this feature of traffic flow, we propose the IMgru model to
   better extract the traffic flow temporal characteristics. In addition,
   the IMgruGcn model is proposed, which combines the graph convolutional
   network (GCN) module and the IMgru module, to extract the spatiotemporal
   features of traffic flow simultaneously. Finally, according to the
   morning and evening peak characteristics of Hangzhou, the Wenyi Road
   dataset is divided into peak period and off-peak period for prediction.
   Comparing the IMgruGcn model with five baseline models and a
   state-of-the-art method, the IMgruGcn model achieves better results.
   Best results were also achieved on a public dataset, demonstrating the
   generalization ability of the IMgruGcn model.

AB Knowledge-based dialog systems have attracted increasing research
   interest in diverse applications. However, for disease diagnosis, the
   widely used knowledge graph (KG) is hard to represent the
   symptom-symptom and symptom-disease relations since the edges of
   traditional KG are unweighted. Most research on disease diagnosis dialog
   systems highly relies on data-driven methods and statistical features,
   lacking profound comprehension of symptom-symptom and symptom-disease
   relations. To tackle this issue, this work presents a weighted
   heterogeneous graph-based dialog system for disease diagnosis.
   Specifically, we build a weighted heterogeneous graph based on symptom
   co-occurrence and the proposed symptom frequency-inverse disease
   frequency. Then, this work proposes a graph-based deep Q-network
   (graph-DQN) for dialog management. By combining graph convolutional
   network (GCN) with DQN to learn the embeddings of diseases and symptoms
   from both the structural and attribute information in the weighted
   heterogeneous graph, graph-DQN could capture the symptom-disease
   relations and symptom-symptom relations better. Experimental results
   show that the proposed dialog system rivals the state-of-the-art models.
   More importantly, the proposed dialog system can complete the task with
   fewer dialog turns and possess a better distinguishing capability on
   diseases with similar symptoms.

AB B atoms and cyano groups co-doped graphite carbon nitride with nitrogen
   vacancies (VN-BC-CN) was explored via one-step in-situ route. A series
   of comprehensive experiments confirmed that B atoms and cyano groups had
   been doped into the framework of graphite carbon nitride, forming
   VN-BC-CN catalyst sample with a large number of nitrogen-vacancy
   defects. As electron acceptors, B and cyano groups could be used as
   active sites for nitrogen conversion. The defect level caused by
   nitrogen vacancy led to red shift of the light absorption edge, which
   resulted in higher separation efficiency of photo-induced carriers and
   faster transfer rate of photo-induced electrons for the VN-BC-CN
   catalyst. This VN-BC-CN catalyst had good photocatalytic nitrogen
   fixation performance in the ultrapure water without any hole scavengers.
   The nitrogen photofixation rate of VN-BC-CN (115.53 mu mol g(-1) h(-1))
   was 25.5 times that of pure carbon nitride (GCN, 4.53 mu mol g(-1)
   h(-1)). Moreover, NH4+ generation rate hardly decreased after 10 h
   reaction, and the NH4+ generation rate could reach 79.56 mu mol g(-1)
   h(-1) in the fifth cycle, showing the good photocatalytic stability of
   the VN-BC-CN catalyst. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Root nodulation results from a symbiotic relationship between a plant
   host and Rhizobium bacteria. Synchronized gene expression patterns over
   the course of rhizobial infection result in activation of pathways that
   are unique but overlapping with the highly conserved pathways that
   enable mycorrhizal symbiosis. We performed RNA sequencing of 30 Medicago
   truncatula root maturation zone samples at five distinct time points.
   These samples included plants inoculated with Sinorhizobium medicae and
   control plants that did not receive any Rhizobium. Following gene
   expression quantification, we identified 1,758 differentially expressed
   genes at various time points. We constructed a gene co-expression
   network (GCN) from the same data and identified link community modules
   (LCMs) that were comprised entirely of differentially expressed genes at
   specific time points post-inoculation. One LCM included genes that were
   up-regulated at 24 h following inoculation, suggesting an activation of
   allergen family genes and carbohydrate-binding gene products in response
   to Rhizobium. We also identified two LCMs that were comprised entirely
   of genes that were down regulated at 24 and 48 h post-inoculation. The
   identity of the genes in these modules suggest that down-regulating
   specific genes at 24 h may result in decreased jasmonic acid production
   with an increase in cytokinin production. At 48 h, coordinated
   down-regulation of a specific set of genes involved in lipid
   biosynthesis may play a role in nodulation. We show that GCN-LCM
   analysis is an effective method to preliminarily identify polygenic
   candidate biomarkers of root nodulation and develop hypotheses for
   future discovery.

AB Identifying synergistic drug combinations (SDCs) is a great challenge
   due to the combinatorial complexity and the fact that SDC is cell line
   specific. The existing computational methods either did not consider the
   cell line specificity of SDC, or did not perform well by building model
   for each cell line independently. In this paper, we present a novel
   encoder-decoder network named SDCNet for predicting cell line-specific
   SDCs. SDCNet learns common patterns across different cell lines as well
   as cell line-specific features in one model for drug combinations. This
   is realized by considering the SDC graphs of different cell lines as a
   relational graph, and constructing a relational graph convolutional
   network (R-GCN) as the encoder to learn and fuse the deep
   representations of drugs for different cell lines. An attention
   mechanism is devised to integrate the drug features from different
   layers of the R-GCN according to their relative importance so that
   representation learning is further enhanced. The common patterns are
   exploited through partial parameter sharing in cell line-specific
   decoders, which not only reconstruct the known SDCs but also predict new
   ones for each cell line. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate
   that SDCNet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and is also robust
   when generalized to new cell lines that are different from the training
   ones. Finally, the case study again confirms the effectiveness of our
   method in predicting novel reliable cell line-specific SDCs.

AB Protein kinase-inhibitor interactions are key to the phosphorylation of
   proteins involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis,
   which shows the importance of binding mechanism research and kinase
   inhibitor design. In this study, a novel machine learning module (i.e.,
   the WL Box) was designed and assembled to the Prediction of Interaction
   Sites of Protein Kinase Inhibitors (PISPKI) model, which is a graph
   convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict the interaction sites of
   protein kinase inhibitors. The WL Box is a novel module based on the
   well-known Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, which assembles multiple switch
   weights to effectively compute graph features. The PISPKI model was
   evaluated by testing with shuffled datasets and ablation analysis using
   11 kinase classes. The accuracy of the PISPKI model with the shuffled
   datasets varied from 83 to 86%, demonstrating superior performance
   compared to two baseline models. The effectiveness of the model was
   confirmed by testing with shuffled datasets. Furthermore, the
   performance of each component of the model was analyzed via the ablation
   study, which demonstrated that the WL Box module was critical. The code
   is available at https://github.com/feiqiwang/PISPKI.

AB Runoff modelling is a crucial element in hydrologic sciences. However, a
   global runoff database is not currently available at a resolution higher
   than 0.1 degrees. We use the recently developed Global Curve Number
   dataset (GCN250) to develop a dynamic runoff application (2015 -
   present) and that can be accessed via a Google Earth Engine application.
   We also provide a global mean monthly runoff dataset for April 2015-2021
   in GeoTIFF format at a 250-meter resolution. We utilize soil moisture
   and GPM rainfall to dynamically retrieve the appropriate curve number
   and generate the corresponding runoff anywhere on Earth. Mean annual
   global runoff ratio results for 2021 were comparable to the runoff ratio
   from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (0.079 vs. 0.077,
   respectively). Mean annual global runoff from GCN and GLDAS were within
   11% each other for 2020-2021 (0.18 vs. 0.16 mm/day, respectively). The
   GCN250 runoff application and the dataset are useful for many water
   applications such hydrologic design, land management, water resources
   management, and flood risk assessment.

AB Background: Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are not easily comparable
   due to their complex structure. In this paper, we propose a tool,
   Juxtapose, together with similarity measures that can be utilized for
   comparative transcriptomics between a set of organisms. While we focus
   on its application to comparing co-expression networks across species in
   evolutionary studies, Juxtapose is also generalizable to co-expression
   network comparisons across tissues or conditions within the same
   species.
   Methods: A word embedding strategy commonly used in natural language
   processing was utilized in order to generate gene embeddings based on
   walks made throughout the GCNs. Juxtapose was evaluated based on its
   ability to embed the nodes of synthetic structures in the networks
   consistently while also generating biologically informative results.
   Evaluation of the techniques proposed in this research utilized RNA-seq
   datasets from GTEx, a multi-species experiment of prefrontal cortex
   samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus, as well as synthesized
   datasets. Biological evaluation was performed using gene set enrichment
   analysis and known gene relationships in literature.
   Results: We show that Juxtapose is capable of globally aligning
   synthesized networks as well as identifying areas that are conserved in
   real gene co-expression networks without reliance on external biological
   information. Furthermore, output from a matching algorithm that uses
   cosine distance between GCN embeddings is shown to be an informative
   measure of similarity that reflects the amount of topological similarity
   between networks.
   Conclusions: Juxtapose can be used to align GCNs without relying on
   known biological similarities and enables post-hoc analyses using
   biological parameters, such as orthology of genes, or conserved or
   variable pathways.

AB Automated multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) image classification has
   recently made significant progress in clinical diagnosis based on the
   advanced deep learning techniques. However, most existing methods mainly
   focus on analyzing locality visual cues from a single image but fail to
   leverage the underlying explicit correlations among different images for
   precise disease diagnosis. By contrast, an experienced radiologist
   expertizes in transferring knowledge from previous tasks to diagnose the
   present radiograph. To enable the machine like a radiologist, this paper
   proposes a novel Semantic Similarity Graph Embedding (SSGE) framework,
   which explicitly explores the semantic similarities among images to
   optimize the visual feature embedding for improving the performance of
   multi-label CXR images classification. Specifically, the proposed SSGE
   framework contains three main components: the image feature embedding
   (IFE) module, similarity graph construction (SGC) module, and semantic
   similarity learning (SSL) module. To realize interactive teaching and
   learning between visual and semantic information, the proposed SSGE
   framework is built on the "Teacher-Student" (semantic-visual) learning
   mechanism. With the guidance and supervision of the cross-image
   similarity graph generated by the SGC module, the SSL module leverages
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to adaptively recalibrate the
   multi-image feature representations extracted from the IFE module, which
   guarantees their semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose a novel
   re-weighting strategy to learn a more optimal semantic-similarity graph
   for the information propagation of the GCN layers. Extensive experiments
   on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method in comparison with some state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Graphite carbon nitride (gCN) has attracted extensive attention due to
   excellent 2D structure and photocatalytic performance since it was
   discovered. In this work, the novel membrane was fabricated with
   acidified graphite carbon nitrogen (aCN) as a selective layer and
   dopamine (DA) as a cushion layer on a polysulfone (PS) membrane. The
   removal effect of aCN membrane on methyl blue and ciprofloxacin has
   improved with the excellent photocatalytic property of aCN. Meanwhile,
   SEM, XRD, FTIR spectra and DLS was performed to investigate the
   morphology, structure and property of the obtained membranes. The
   results showed that dopamine not only provided adhesion for aCN, but
   also enhanced photoelectron transfer. The membrane with optimized
   conditions aided by the structure and photocatalytic performance of aCN
   exhibited great removal rates for both methyl blue (97.2%) and
   ciprofloxacin (99.4%). The above experiments proved the advantages of
   aCN in the removal of dyes and antibiotics in coupling filtration and
   photocatalysis.

AB The signalling pathway governing general control nonderepressible (Gcn)2
   kinase allows cells to cope with amino acid shortage. Under starvation,
   Gcn2 phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eukaryotic
   translation initiation factor (eIF)2 alpha, triggering downstream events
   that ultimately allow cells to cope with starvation. Under
   nutrient-replete conditions, the translation elongation factor eEF1A
   binds Gcn2 to contribute to keeping Gcn2 inactive. Here, we aimed to map
   the regions in eEF1A involved in binding and/or regulating Gcn2. We find
   that eEF1A amino acids 1-221 and 222-315, containing most of domains I
   and II, respectively, bind Gcn2 in vitro. Overexpression of eEF1A
   lacking or containing domain III impairs eIF2 alpha phosphorylation.
   While the latter reduces growth under starvation similarly to eEF1A
   lacking domain I, the former enhances growth in a Gcn2-dependent manner.
   Our studies suggest that domain II is required for Gcn2 inhibition and
   that eEF1A lacking domain III mainly affects the Gcn2 response pathway
   downstream of Gcn2.

AB Diagnosis assistant is an effective way to reduce the workloads of
   professional doctors. The rich professional knowledge plays a crucial
   role in diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to introduce the relevant
   medical knowledge into diagnosis assistant. In this paper, diagnosis
   assistant is treated as a classification task, and a Graph-based
   Structural Knowledge-aware Network (GSKN) model is proposed to fuse
   Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and medical knowledge graph.
   Considering that different information in EMRs affects the diagnosis
   results differently, the information in EMRs is categorized into general
   information, key information and numerical information, and is
   introduced to GSKN by adding an enhancement layer to the Bidirectional
   Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. The entities in
   EMRs are recognized, and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) is
   employed to learn deep-level graph structure information and dynamic
   representation of these entities in the subgraphs. An interactive
   attention mechanism is utilized to fuse the enhanced textual
   representation and the deep representation of these subgraphs.
   Experimental results on Chinese Obstetric Electronic Medical Records
   (COEMRs) and open dataset C-EMRs demonstrate the e ffectiveness of our
   model.

AB Motivation: The analysis of gene co-expression network (GCN) is critical
   in examining the gene-gene interactions and learning the underlying
   complex yet highly organized gene regulatory mechanisms. Numerous
   clustering methods have been developed to detect communities of
   co-expressed genes in the large network. The assumed independent
   community structure, however, can be oversimplified and may not
   adequately characterize the complex biological processes.
   Results: We develop a new computational package to extract
   interconnected communities from gene co-expression network. We consider
   a pair of communities be interconnected if a subset of genes from one
   community is correlated with a subset of genes from another community.
   The interconnected community structure is more flexible and provides a
   better fit to the empirical co-expression matrix. To overcome the
   computational challenges, we develop efficient algorithms by leveraging
   advanced graph norm shrinkage approach. We validate and show the
   advantage of our method by extensive simulation studies. We then apply
   our interconnected community detection method to an RNA-seq data from
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) study and
   identify essential interacting biological pathways related to the immune
   evasion mechanism of tumor cells.

AB In a complex network, some nodes are relatively concentrated in
   topological structure, thus forming a relatively independent node group,
   which we call a community. Usually, there are multiple communities on a
   network, and these communities are interconnected and exchange
   information with each other. A node that plays an important role in the
   process of information exchange between communities is called an
   inter-community bridge node. Traditional methods of defining and
   detecting bridge nodes mostly quantify the bridging effect of nodes by
   collecting local structural information of nodes and defining index
   operations. However, on the one hand, it is often difficult to capture
   the deep topological information in complex networks based on a single
   indicator, resulting in inaccurate evaluation results; on the other
   hand, for networks without community structure, such methods may rely on
   community partitioning algorithms, which require significant computing
   power. In this paper, considering the multi-dimensional attributes and
   structural characteristics of nodes, a deep learning-based framework
   named BND is designed to quickly and accurately detect bridge nodes.
   Considering that the bridging function of nodes between communities is
   abstract and complex, and may be related to the multi-dimensional
   information of nodes, we construct an attribute graph on the basis of
   the original graph according to the features of the five dimensions of
   the node to meet our needs for extracting bridging-related attributes.
   In the deep learning model, we overlay graph neural network layers to
   process the input attribute graph and add fully connected layers to
   improve the final classification effect of the model. Graph neural
   network algorithms including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE are compatible with
   our proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the
   first application of graph neural network techniques in the field of
   bridge node detection. Experiments show that our designed framework can
   effectively capture network topology information and accurately detect
   bridge nodes in the network. In the overall model effect evaluation
   results based on indicators such as Accuracy and F1 score, our proposed
   graph neural network model is generally better than baseline methods. In
   the best case, our model has an Accuracy of 0.9050 and an F1 score of
   0.8728.

AB Recent works have shown that multi-label image recognition is still a
   challenging task in computer vision due to the complicatedness and
   diversity of multi-label images. However, the existing works ignore the
   co-occurrence correlation and global contextual information between
   image space and objects. We present a model to solve these problems. On
   the one hand, we devise the graph attention mechanism to compute the
   hidden representations of different categories in multi-label images. It
   can specify different weights to different neighbor objects and well
   model the label dependency. On the other hand, we iterate the global
   contextual information by the second-order covariance pooling to enhance
   nonlinear modeling capability and use basic residual network to extract
   features. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated on PASCAL VOC 2007
   and MS-COCO datasets. Compared with classical ML-GCN, the model can
   better combine the image features and label embedding. Meanwhile,
   experiments show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods such
   as residual multi-layer perception, EfficientNet, and vision
   transformer. (C) 2021 SPIE and IS&T

AB Computer-vision techniques provide a way to conduct low-cost, portable,
   and real-time evaluations of exercises performed as a part of physical
   rehabilitation. Recent data-driven methods have explored using deep
   learning on 3D body-landmark sequences for automatic assessment of
   physical rehabilitation exercises. However, existing deep learning
   methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) fail to utilize the
   spatial connection information of the human body, which limits the
   accuracy of these assessments. To overcome these limitations and provide
   a more accurate method to assess physical rehabilitation exercises, we
   propose a deep learning framework using a graph convolutional network
   (GCN) with self-supervised regularization. The experimental results on
   an existing benchmark dataset validate that the proposed method achieves
   state-of-the-art performance with lower error than other CNN methods,
   and the self-supervised learning improves the prediction
   accuracy.Clinical relevance-This work established a supervised learning
   method to automatically assess physical rehabilitation exercises in the
   home environment using computer vision. This low-cost, portable, and
   real-time evaluation may provide clinicians with a way to provide
   feedback to patients about their exercise performance without having to

   that, in plants, ILA could be also playing a role in development
   independent of GCN2. To gain insight into this new function of the ILA
   protein, we have performed proteomic analysis to identify
   differentially-expressed proteins in the strong loss-of-function allele
   of ILA (ila2). ila2 plants present a reduced expression of
   photosynthetic proteins, and an increased expression of the
   translational initiation factor eiF5A, ribosomal proteins and heat-shock
   proteins. These results open new hypothesis to understand the roles of
   this important translational regulator in plant tissues.

AB This paper investigates vehicle trajectory prediction problems in real
   traffic scenarios by fully harnessing the spatio-temporal dependencies
   between multiple vehicles. The existing GCN-based trajectory predictions
   are often considered in a single traffic scene without time attributes,
   complete interaction information, dynamic graph-based model, etc. Time
   and interaction aware models are more challenging than the existing
   ones. Despite very well does the graph-based model describe the
   relationship between driving vehicles, the critical problem in the
   traffic scene is how to deeply explore the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of dynamic graphs. Therefore, a novel dynamic graph and
   interaction-aware neural network model called as DGInet is proposed by
   combining a semi-global graph mechanism and an M-product based graph
   convolutional network, which are built into novel dual-network
   architecture in the entire model. The DGInet is built by exploiting the
   dynamic interaction in depth between driving vehicles in urban traffic
   scenarios, and then realized by utilizing semi-global graph convolution
   operations on the input data cell to capture the basic spatial
   interaction features of the driving scene. Meanwhile, the dynamic graph
   is further extracted by a novel M-product approach, in which the
   embedding of the model is then established along with the embedding of
   the semi-global network to perform the final embedding. Extensive
   experiments have been conducted on the two public datasets, named NGSIM
   and Apollo respectively, to show that our approach outperforms the
   existing ones with better performance and less computing time. Besides
   the real-world Shenzhen traffic dataset, China, is also developed to
   verify the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB With the rapid development of information technology, the amount of
   textual data generated in biomedical field becomes larger and larger.
   Biomedical event extraction, which is a fundamental information
   extraction task, has gained a growing interest in biomedical community.
   Although researchers have proposed various approaches to this task, the
   performance is still undesirable since previous approaches fail to model
   biomedical documents effectively. In this paper, we propose an
   end-to-end framework for document-level joint biomedical event
   extraction. To better capture the complex relationships among contexts
   in biomedical documents, a two-level modeling approach is introduced for
   biomedical documents. More specifically, the dependency-based GCN and
   hypergraph are used to model local context and global context in each
   biomedical document, respectively. In addition, a fine-grained
   interaction mechanism is proposed to model effectively the interaction
   between local and global contexts to learn better contextualized
   representations for biomedical event extraction. Comprehensive
   experiments on two widely used datasets are conducted and the results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework over
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the remarkable success of representation learning for prediction
   problems, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of the use of machine
   learning and deep learning for the analysis of digital pathology and
   biopsy image patches. However, learning over patch-wise features using
   convolutional neural networks limits the ability of the model to capture
   global contextual information and comprehensively model tissue
   composition. The phenotypical and topological distribution of
   constituent histological entities play a critical role in tissue
   diagnosis. As such, graph data representations and deep learning have
   attracted significant attention for encoding tissue representations, and
   capturing intra-and inter-entity level interactions. In this review, we
   provide a conceptual grounding for graph analytics in digital pathology,
   including entity-graph construction and graph architectures, and present
   their current success for tumor localization and classification, tumor
   invasion and staging, image retrieval, and survival prediction. We
   provide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner organized by
   the graph representation of the input image, scale, and organ on which
   they operate. We also outline the limitations of existing techniques,
   and suggest potential future research directions in this domain.

AB Electroanatomic mapping is the gold standard for the assessment of
   ventricular tachycardia. Acquiring high resolution electroanatomic maps
   is technically challenging and may require interpolation methods to
   obtain dense measurements. These methods, however, cannot recover
   activation times in the entire biventricular domain. This work
   investigates the use of graph convolutional neural networks to estimate
   biventricular activation times from sparse measurements. Our method is
   trained on more than 15,000 synthetic examples of realistic ventricular
   depolarization patterns generated by a computational electrophysiology
   model. Using geometries sampled from a statistical shape model of
   biventricular anatomy, diverse wave dynamics are induced by randomly
   sampling scar and border zone distributions, locations of initial
   activation, and tissue conduction velocities. Once trained, the method
   accurately reconstructs biventricular activation times in left-out
   synthetic simulations with a mean absolute error of 3.9 ms +/- 4.2 ms at
   a sampling density of one measurement sample per cm(2). The total
   activation time is matched with a mean error of 1.4 ms +/- 1.4 ms. A
   significant decrease in errors is observed in all heart zones with an
   increased number of samples. Without re-training, the network is further
   evaluated on two datasets: (1) an in-house dataset comprising four
   ischemic porcine hearts with dense endocardial activation maps; (2) the
   CRT-EPIGGY19 challenge data comprising endo- and epicardial measurements
   of 5 infarcted and 6 non-infarcted swines. In both setups the neural
   network recovers biventricular activation times with a mean absolute
   error of less than 10 ms even when providing only a subset of
   endocardial measurements as input. Furthermore, we present a simple
   approach to suggest new measurement locations in real-time based on the
   estimated uncertainty of the graph network predictions. The model-guided
   selection of measurement locations allows to reduce by 40% the number of
   measurements required in a random sampling strategy, while achieving the
   same prediction error. In all the tested scenarios, the proposed
   approach estimates biventricular activation times with comparable or
   better performance than a personalized computational model and
   significant runtime advantages.

AB Purpose A community demonstrates the unique qualities and relationships
   between its members that distinguish it from other communities within a
   network. Network analysis relies heavily on community detection. Despite
   the traditional spectral clustering and statistical inference methods,
   deep learning techniques for community detection have grown in
   popularity due to their ease of processing high-dimensional network
   data. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have received much
   attention recently and have developed into a potential and ubiquitous
   method for directly detecting communities on graphs. Inspired by the
   promising results of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in analyzing
   graph structure data, a novel community graph convolutional network
   (CommunityGCN) as a semi-supervised node classification model has been
   proposed and compared with recent baseline methods graph attention
   network (GAT), GCN-based technique for unsupervised community detection
   and Markov random fields combined with graph convolutional network
   (MRFasGCN). Design/methodology/approach This work presents the method
   for identifying communities that combines the notion of node
   classification via message passing with the architecture of a
   semi-supervised graph neural network. Six benchmark datasets, namely,
   Cora, CiteSeer, ACM, Karate, IMDB and Facebook, have been used in the
   experimentation. Findings In the first set of experiments, the scaled
   normalized average matrix of all neighbor's features including the node
   itself was obtained, followed by obtaining the weighted average matrix
   of low-dimensional nodes. In the second set of experiments, the average
   weighted matrix was forwarded to the GCN with two layers and the
   activation function for predicting the node class was applied. The
   results demonstrate that node classification with GCN can improve the
   performance of identifying communities on graph datasets.
   Originality/value The experiment reveals that the CommunityGCN approach
   has given better results with accuracy, normalized mutual information,
   F1 and modularity scores of 91.26, 79.9, 92.58 and 70.5 per cent,
   respectively, for detecting communities in the graph network, which is
   much greater than the range of 55.7-87.07 per cent reported in previous
   literature. Thus, it has been concluded that the GCN with node
   classification models has improved the accuracy.

AB The Transformer has been applied into computer vision to explore
   long-range dependencies with multi -head self-attention strategy,
   therefore numerous Transformer-based methods for person
   re-identification (ReID) are designed for extracting effective as well
   as robust representation. However, the memory and computational
   complexity of scaled dot-product attention in Transformer cost vast
   overheads. To over-come these limitations, this paper presents ResT-ReID
   method, which designs a hybrid backbone Res-Transformer based on
   ResNet-50 and Transformer block for effective identify information.
   Specifically, we use global self-attention in place of depth-wise
   convolution in the fourth layer's residual bottleneck of ResNet-50. For
   fully exploiting the entire knowledge of the person, we devise
   attention-guided Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) with side information
   embedding (SIE-AGCN), which has an attention layer located into two GCN
   layers. The quantified experiments on two large-scale ReID benchmarks
   demon-strate that the proposed ResT-ReID achieves competitive results
   compared with several state-of-the-art approaches. (c) 2022 Published by

AB While the technologies of ribonucleic acid-sequence (RNA-seq) and
   transcript assembly analysis have continued to improve, a novel topology
   of RNA transcript was uncovered in the last decade and is called
   circular RNA (circRNA). Recently, researchers have revealed that they
   compete with messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding for combining with
   microRNA in gene regulation. Therefore, circRNA was assumed to be
   associated with complex disease and discovering the relationship between
   them would contribute to medical research. However, the work of
   identifying the association between circRNA and disease in vitro takes a
   long time and usually without direction. During these years, more and
   more associations were verified by experiments. Hence, we proposed a
   computational method named identifying circRNA-disease association based
   on graph representation learning (iGRLCDA) for the prediction of the
   potential association of circRNA and disease, which utilized a deep
   learning model of graph convolution network (GCN) and graph
   factorization (GF). In detail, iGRLCDA first derived the hidden feature
   of known associations between circRNA and disease using the Gaussian
   interaction profile (GIP) kernel combined with disease semantic
   information to form a numeric descriptor. After that, it further used
   the deep learning model of GCN and GF to extract hidden features from
   the descriptor. Finally, the random forest classifier is introduced to
   identify the potential circRNA-disease association. The five-fold
   cross-validation of iGRLCDA shows strong competitiveness in comparison
   with other excellent prediction models at the gold standard data and
   achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve of 0.9289 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9377.
   On reviewing the prediction results from the relevant literature, 22 of
   the top 30 predicted circRNA-disease associations were noted in recent
   published papers. These exceptional results make us believe that iGRLCDA
   can provide reliable circRNA-disease associations for medical research
   and reduce the blindness of wet-lab experiments.

AB The rapidly increasing wind power penetration presents new challenges to
   the operation of power systems. Improving the accuracy of wind power
   forecasting is a possible solution under this circumstance. In the power
   forecasting of multiple wind farms, determining the spatio-temporal
   correlation of multiple wind farms is critical for improving the
   forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal
   convolutional network (STCN) that utilizes a directed graph
   convolutional structure. A temporal convolutional network is also
   adopted to characterize the temporal features of wind power. Historical
   data from 15 wind farms in Australia are used in the case study. The
   forecasting results show that the proposed model has higher accuracy
   than the existing methods. Based on the structure of the STCN,
   asymmetric spatial correlation at different temporal scales can be
   observed, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB It is the prerequisite to ensure the safety of road users in traffic
   scenes for the application of autonomous vehicles. Pedestrians are the
   main participants in traffic scenes, and reasonable inference and
   prediction of their future trajectories are crucial for autonomous
   driving technology and road safety. Pedestrian trajectories are highly
   dynamic, apparently random, and complex to interact with traffic
   environment agents; therefore, selective modeling of spatial interaction
   and temporal dependence of pedestrians is necessary. To address this
   challenge, this paper proposes a novel pedestrian trajectory prediction
   model based on a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network
   (PTP-STGCN). Specifically, a new crowd interaction attention (CIA)
   function is defined to quantify the interaction information between
   adjacent pedestrians better. This function captures the spatial
   interaction features of pedestrians at each time step by a spatial graph
   convolution network (S-GCN). Meanwhile, the time-series motion features
   of each pedestrian are extracted by a temporal transformer network
   (T-transformer), and a spatio-temporal interaction graph of pedestrian
   features is constructed by the STGCN composed of the S-GCN and
   T-transformer. Finally, a time-extrapolator convolutional neural network
   (TXP-CNN) is used to predict pedestrian trajectories in the time
   dimension of the STGCN. The experimental results on the ETH and UCY
   datasets show that the proposed model achieves better performance than
   the state-of-the-art baselines regarding the average displacement error
   (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE). Due to the excellent
   performance in pedestrian trajectory prediction, the proposed network
   achieves more predictive final planned trajectory of an autonomous
   vehicle, while avoiding unnecessary trajectory changes and collision
   risk, thus providing a promising solution for practical pedestrian
   trajectory prediction applications.

AB Recent advances in deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) boost the
   development of video salient object detection (SOD), and many remarkable
   deep-CNNs video SOD models have been proposed. However, many existing
   deep-CNNs video SOD models still suffer from coarse boundaries of the
   salient object, which may be attributed to the loss of high-frequency
   information. The traditional graph-based video SOD models can preserve
   object boundaries well by conducting superpixels/supervoxels
   segmentation in advance, but they perform weaker in highlighting the
   whole object than the latest deep-CNNs models, limited by heuristic
   graph clustering algorithms. To tackle this problem, we find a new way
   to address this issue under the framework of graph convolution networks
   (GCNs), taking advantage of graph model and deep neural network.
   Specifically, a superpixel-level spatiotemporal graph is first
   constructed among multiple frame-pairs by exploiting the motion cues
   implied in the frame-pairs. Then the graph data is imported into the
   devised multi-stream attention-aware GCN, where a novel Edge-Gated graph
   convolution (GC) operation is proposed to boost the saliency information
   aggregation on the graph data. A novel attention module is designed to
   encode the spatiotemporal sematic information via adaptive selection of
   graph nodes and fusion of the static-specific and the motion-specific
   graph embedding. Finally, a smoothness-aware regularization term is
   proposed to enhance the uniformity of salient object. Graph nodes
   (superpixels) inherently belonging to the same class will be ideally
   clustered together in the learned embedding space. Extensive experiments
   have been conducted on three widely used datasets. Compared with
   fourteen state-of-the-art video SOD models, our proposed method can well
   retain the salient object boundaries and possess a strong learning
   ability, which shows that this work is a good practice for designing
   GCNs for video SOD.

AB Many studies on Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) approaches have emerged.
   The techniques have rapidly improved performance for various graph
   neural network (GNN) models, increasing the current state-of-the-art
   accuracy by absolute values of 4.20%, 5.50%, and 4.40% on Cora,
   Citeseer, and PubMed, respectively. The success is attributed to two
   integral properties of relational approaches: topology -level and
   feature-level augmentation. This work provides an overview of some GDA
   algorithms which are reasonably categorized based on these integral
   properties. Next, we engage the three most widely used GNN backbones
   (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) as plug-and-play methods for conducting
   experiments. We conclude by evaluating the algorithm's effectiveness to
   demonstrate significant differences among various GDA techniques based
   on accuracy and time complexity with additional datasets different from
   those used in the original works. While discussing practical and
   theoretical motivations, considerations, and strategies for GDA, this
   work comprehensively investigates the challenges and future direction by
   pinpointing several open conceivable issues that may require further
   study based on far-reaching literature interpretation and empirical
   outcomes.

AB Traffic prediction is the key for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to
   achieve traffic control and traffic guidance, and the key challenge is
   that traffic flow has complex spatial-temporal dependence and nonlinear
   dynamics. Aiming at the lack of the ability to model complex and dynamic
   spatial-temporal dependencies in current research, this paper proposes a
   traffic flow prediction model Attention based Graph Convolution Network
   (GCN) and Transformer (AGCN-T) to model spatial-temporal network
   dynamics of traffic flow, which can extract dynamic spatial dependence
   and long-distance temporal dependence to improve the accuracy of
   multistep traffic prediction. AGCN-T consists of three modules. In the
   spatial dependency extraction module, according to the similarity of
   historical traffic flow sequences of different loop detectors, an
   adjacency matrix for the road network is constructed based on a sequence
   similarity calculation method, Predictive Power Score (PPS), to express
   latent spatial dependency; and then GCN is used on the adjacency matrix
   to capture the global spatial correlation and Transformer is used to
   capture dynamic spatial dependency from the most recently flow
   sequences. And then, the dynamic spatial dependency is merged with the
   global spatial correlation to obtain the overall spatial dependency
   pattern. In the temporal dependency extraction module, the temporal
   dependency pattern of each traffic flow sequence is learned by the
   temporal Transformer. The prediction module integrates both patterns to
   form spatial-temporal dependency patterns and performs multistep traffic
   flow prediction. Four sets of experiments are performed on three actual
   traffic datasets to show that AGCN-T can effectively capture the dynamic
   spatial-temporal dependency of the traffic network, and its prediction
   performance and efficiency are better than existing baselines. AGCN-T
   can effectively capture the dynamics in traffic flow. In addition to
   traffic flow prediction, it can also be applied to other
   spatial-temporal prediction tasks, such as passenger demand prediction
   and crowd flow prediction.

AB Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction (TOWE) aims to identify opinion
   words toward a specific target given the sentence. Syntax structure,
   which contains dependency relationships among words, is a vital clue for
   this task. With the help of syntax structure as a constraint, the model
   could remove irrelevant words and focus on tokens that are relevant to
   the given target. Directly adapting existing syntactic based methods
   faces the problem that these models do not explicitly learn
   target-centric representations. Another challenge is that prior works
   only learn fixed order dependency relations, while context words require
   syntactic information in different scales. To handle these issues, we
   propose Target-Specific Graph Convolutional Network (TS-GCN) to
   explicitly integrate dependency structure. The proposed method could
   build high-quality syntax-aware representations by propagating target
   information to syntactically related words via graph convolution.
   Furthermore, we design a memory-based module to dynamically learn
   multi-granularity syntactic knowledge and infuse local features.
   Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we
   achieve state-of-the-art performances on four SemEval datasets.

AB Detecting pedestrians, especially under heavy occlusion, is a
   challenging computer vision problem with numerous real-world
   applications. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed as PSC-Net,
   for occluded pedestrian detection. The proposed PSC-Net contains a
   dedicated module that is designed to explicitly capture both inter and
   intra-part co-occurrence information of different pedestrian body parts
   through a graph convolutional network (GCN). Both inter and intra-part
   co-occurrence information contribute towards improving the feature
   representation for handling varying level of occlusions, ranging from
   partial to severe occlusions. Our PSC-Net exploits the topological
   structure of pedestrian and does not require part-based annotations or
   additional visible bounding-box (VBB) information to learn part spatial
   co-occurrence. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three
   challenging datasets: CityPersons, Caltech, and CrowdHuman datasets.
   Particularly, in terms of log-average miss rates and with the same
   backbone and input scale as those of the state-of-the-art MGAN, the
   proposed PSC-Net achieves absolute gains of 4.0% and 3.4% over MGAN on
   the heavy occlusion subsets of CityPersons and Caltech test sets,
   respectively.

AB ALSC (Aspect-level Sentiment Classification) is a fine-grained task in
   the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing) which aims to identify
   the sentiment toward a given aspect. In addition to exploiting the
   sentence semantics and syntax, current ALSC methods focus on introducing
   external knowledge as a supplementary to the sentence information.
   However, the integration of the three categories of information is still
   challenging. In this paper, a novel method is devised to effectively
   combine sufficient semantic and syntactic information as well as use of
   external knowledge. The proposed model contains a sentence encoder, a
   semantic learning module, a syntax learning module, a knowledge
   enhancement module, an information fusion module and a sentiment
   classifier. The semantic information and syntactic information are
   respectively extracted via a self-attention network and a graphical
   convolutional network. Specifically, the KGE (Knowledge Graph Embedding)
   is employed to enhance the feature representation of the aspect. Then,
   the attention-based gate mechanism is taken to fuse three types of
   information. We evaluated the proposed model on three benchmark datasets
   and the experimental results establish strong evidence of high accuracy.

AB As a typical spatiotemporal problem, there are three main challenges in
   traffic forecasting. First, the road network is a nonregular topology,
   and it is difficult to extract complex spatial dependence accurately.
   Second, there are short- and long-term dependencies between traffic
   dates. Third, there are many other factors besides the influence of
   spatiotemporal dependence, such as semantic characteristics. To address
   these issues, we propose a spatiotemporal DeepWalk gated recurrent unit
   model (ST-DWGRU), a deep learning framework that fuses spatial,
   temporal, and semantic features for traffic speed forecasting. In the
   framework, the spatial dependency between nodes of an entire road
   network is extracted by graph convolutional network (GCN), whereas the
   temporal dependency between speeds is captured by a gated recurrent unit
   network (GRU). DeepWalk is used to extract semantic information from
   road networks. Three publicly available datasets with different time
   granularities of 15, 30, and 60 min are used to validate the short- and
   long-time prediction effect of this model. The results show that the
   ST-DWGRU model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB One trend in the latest bottom-up approaches for arbitrary-shape scene
   text detection is to determine the links between text segments using
   Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). However, the performance of these
   bottom-up methods is still inferior to that of state-of-the-art top-down
   methods even with the help of GCNs. We argue that a cause of this is
   that bottom-up methods fail to make proper use of visual-relational
   features, which results in accumulated false detection, as well as the
   error-prone route-finding used for grouping text segments. In this
   paper, we improve classic bottom-up text detection frameworks by fusing
   the visual-relational features of text with two effective false
   positive/negative suppression (FPNS) mechanisms and developing a new
   shape-approximation strategy. First, dense overlapping text segments
   depicting the "characterness" and "streamline" properties of text are
   constructed and used in weakly supervised node classification to filter
   the falsely detected text segments. Then, relational features and visual
   features of text segments are fused with a novel Location-Aware Transfer
   (LAT) module and Fuse Decoding (FD) module to jointly rectify the
   detected text segments. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware
   contour-approximation strategy is developed based on the rectified text
   segments, instead of the error-prone route-finding process, to generate
   the final contour of the detected text. Experiments conducted on five
   benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the
   state-of-the-art performance when embedded in a classic text detection
   framework, which revitalizes the strengths of bottom-up methods.

AB Slot filling and intent detection are the basic and crucial fields of
   natural language processing (NLP) for understanding and analyzing human
   language, owing to their wide applications in real-world scenarios. Most
   existing methods of slot filling and intent detection tasks utilize
   linear chain conditional random field (CRF) for only optimizing slot
   filling, no matter the method is a pipeline or a joint model. In order
   to describe and exploit the implicit connections which indicate the
   appearance compatibility of different tag pairs, we introduce a
   graph-based CRF for a joint optimization of tag distribution of the
   slots and the intents. Instead of applying the complex inference
   algorithm of traditional graph-based CRF, we use an end-to-end method to
   implement the inference, which is formulated as a specialized
   multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN). Furthermore, mask
   mechanism is introduced to our model for addressing multi-task problems
   with different tag-sets. Experimental results show the superiority of

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant
   attention as a commonly used method for hyperspectral image (HSI)
   classification in recent years; however, CNNs can only be applied to
   Euclidean data and have difficulties in dealing with relationships due
   to their limitations of local feature extraction. Each pixel of a
   hyperspectral image contains a set of spectral bands that are correlated
   and interact with each other, and the methods used to process Euclidean
   data cannot effectively obtain these correlations. In contrast, the
   graph convolutional network (GCN) can be used in non-Euclidean data but
   usually leads to over-smoothing and ignores local detail features due to
   the need for superpixel segmentation processing to reduce computational
   effort. To overcome the above problems, we constructed a fusion network
   based on the GCN and CNN which contains two branches: a graph
   convolutional network based on superpixel segmentation and a
   convolutional network with an added attention mechanism. The graph
   convolutional branch can extract the structural features and capture the
   relationships between the nodes, and the convolutional branch can
   extract detailed features in the local fine region. Owing to the fact
   that the features extracted from the two branches are different, the
   classification performance can be improved by fusing the complementary
   features extracted from the two branches. To validate the proposed
   algorithm, experiments were conducted on three widely used datasets,
   namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. An overall accuracy
   of 98.78% was obtained in the Indian Pines dataset, and overall
   accuracies of 98.99% and 98.69% were obtained in the other two datasets.
   The results show that the proposed fusion network can obtain richer
   features and achieve a high classification accuracy.

AB In an urban environment, the accurate prediction of congestion levels is
   a prerequisite for formulating traffic demand management strategies
   reasonably. Current traffic forecasting studies mostly focus on the road
   topological network and assume that the spatial linkages of road
   segments is fixed, thus ignoring associated congestion level changes
   between road segments. This study introduces a fusion-based graph
   convolutional network called the F-GCN. The model aims to capture the
   dynamic correlations of the congestion levels among road segments while
   constructing the static topology of the road network. In particular, the
   entropy-based grey relation analysis method is first implemented in the
   dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN) module to measure the
   potential correlations among the observed congestion levels. Then,
   spatio-temporal blocks that integrate GCN layers, spatial attention
   mechanisms, and long short-term memory layers are built for both the
   static and dynamic GCN modules. Finally, the F-GCN model is developed by
   fusing the static GCN and dynamic GCN module. The numerical experiments
   on Beijing taxies demonstrated that the proposed F-GCN model achieved a
   significant 5.47%, 5.64%, and 8.14% improvements for the 15-, 30-, and
   45-min prediction tasks in the weighted mean absolute percentage error
   compared to the state-of-the-art baseline models. This improvement
   highlights the effectiveness of the model in predicting congestion
   levels, demonstrating its superiority and potential in capturing the
   dynamic potential correlations among the congestion levels of road

AB The discovery of hydrocarbon reserves has declined significantly in
   recent years owing to the structural and lithological heterogeneities
   present in reservoirs. To overcome this decline, it is crucial to
   incorporate advanced computational methods, such as machine learning
   (ML) and deep learning (DL). These technologies can facilitate more
   precise discovery of hydrocarbon reserves, thereby replenishing and
   increasing the supply of proven reserves. By utilizing ML and DL,
   likelihood of errors arising from human error or bias during exploration
   activities can be diminished substantially. This is due to the extensive
   incorporation of sophisticated statistical techniques within the
   applications of ML and DL. Well logs provide valuable information about
   the physical characteristics of subterranean fluids and rocks. In the
   McKee field in New Zealand, the lithology of three wells was determined
   using petrophysical parameters, such as porosity, permeability, water
   saturation, volume shale, and oil saturation that were extracted from
   the well logs. The unsupervised method K-means clustering (KMC) was used
   to perform facies classification tasks, utilizing clusters that matched
   the well's facies and ranged from 5 to 10 and each well yielded six
   pairs of outputs. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) are reliable
   technique for working with graph representations. The best performance
   is achieved by directly integrating graph convolutions with feature
   information and related parameters. The petrophysical parameters were
   combined with the unlabeled KMC outputs to form the GCN dataset. The
   initial potential zones were classified into five classes based on
   petrophysical criteria: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low.
   This GCN approach was used to identify each graph quality in the
   dataset. The hydrocarbon potential of the three wells was evaluated
   using the graph dataset and the GCN approach, which produced results
   with higher accuracy when real labels were used. The findings of this
   study indicate that the identification of a hydrocarbon-rich region
   through the utilization of a graph that integrates lithological and
   petrophysical data requires a comprehensive understanding of the
   subsurface that goes beyond lithology alone. To achieve this, a novel
   method for predicting hydrocarbon potential based on GCN is proposed,
   which combines graph datasets derived from well logs consisting of
   petrophysical entities and depth values.

AB Traffic flow forecasting is a basic function of intelligent
   transportation systems, and the accuracy of prediction is of great
   significance for traffic management and urban planning. The main
   difficulty of traffic flow predictions is that there is complex
   underlying spatiotemporal dependence in traffic flow; thus, the existing
   spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN) models need to model both
   temporal dependence and spatial dependence. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
   are adopted to capture the spatial dependence in traffic flow, which can
   model the symmetric or asymmetric spatial relations between nodes in the
   traffic network. The transmission process of traffic features in GNNs is
   guided by the node-to-node relationship (e.g., adjacency or spatial
   distance) between nodes, ignoring the spatial dependence caused by local
   topological constraints in the road network. To further consider the
   influence of local topology on the spatial dependence of road networks,
   in this paper, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature information between
   connected edges in the road network, which is based on optimal transport
   theory and makes comprehensive use of the neighborhood-to-neighborhood
   relationship to guide the transmission process of traffic features
   between nodes in STGNNs. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets show
   that the models with Ollivier-Ricci curvature information outperforms
   those based on only node-to-node relationships between nodes by ten
   percent on average in the RMSE metric. This study indicates that by
   utilizing complex topological features in road networks, spatial
   dependence can be captured more sufficiently, further improving the
   predictive ability of traffic forecasting models.

AB The biggest challenge to recommendation systems based on user
   preferences is how to improve the ability of the recommendation system
   to mine and analyse user preferences and behaviours. In this process, we
   must not only consider the continuation of the user's long-term
   preference but also improve the system's ability to accommodate
   short-term preferences and discrete preferences. To this end, we focus
   on the performance of time factors of user preferences. However, the
   issue we are concerned about has not received much attention in the
   existing research. We propose a new recommendation model based on the
   perspective of user sessions, namely GACOforRec. This model can handle
   long-term and stable preferences at the same time and preserve the
   hierarchy of potential preferences. We conducted a large number of
   comparative experiments on two real datasets, and the results show that
   GACOforRec is significantly better than other state-of-the-art methods
   in the study of user sessions.

AB In the few-shot common-localization task, given few support images
   without bounding box annotations at each episode, the goal is to
   localize the common object in the query image of unseen categories. The
   few-shot common-localization task involves common object reasoning from
   the given images, predicting the spatial locations of the object with
   different shapes, sizes, and orientations. In this work, we propose a
   common-centric localization (CCL) network for few-shot
   common-localization. The motivation of our common-centric localization
   network is to learn the common object features by dynamic feature
   relation reasoning via a graph convolutional network with conditional
   feature aggregation. First, we propose a local common object region
   generation pipeline to reduce background noises due to feature
   misalignment. Each support image predicts more accurate object spatial
   locations by replacing the query with the images in the support set.
   Second, we introduce a graph convolutional network with dynamic feature
   transformation to enforce the common object reasoning. To enhance the
   discriminability during feature matching and enable a better
   generalization in unseen scenarios, we leverage a conditional feature
   encoding function to alter visual features according to the input query
   adaptively. Third, we introduce a common-centric relation structure to
   model the correlation between the common features and the query image
   feature. The generated common features guide the query image feature
   towards a more common object-related representation. We evaluate our
   common-centric localization network on four datasets, i.e., CL-VOC-07,
   CL-VOC-12, CL-COCO, CL-VID. We obtain significant improvements compared
   to state-of-the-art. Our quantitative results confirm the effectiveness
   of our network.

AB We propose to use segment graph convolutional and recurrent neural
   networks (Seg-GCRNs), which use only word embedding and sentence
   syntactic dependencies, to classify relations from clinical notes
   without manual feature engineering. In this study, the relations between
   2 medical concepts are classified by simultaneously learning
   representations of text segments in the context of sentence syntactic
   dependency: preceding, concept(1), middle, concept(2), and succeeding
   segments. Seg-GCRN was systematically evaluated on the i2b2/VA relation
   classification challenge datasets. Experiments show that Seg-GCRN
   attains state-of-the-art micro-averaged F-measure for all 3 relation
   categories: 0.692 for classifying medical treatment-problem relations,
   0.827 for medical test-problem relations, and 0.741 for medical
   problem-medical problem relations. Comparison with the previous
   state-of-the-art segment convolutional neural network (Seg-CNN) suggests
   that adding syntactic dependency information helps refine medical word
   embedding and improves concept relation classification without manual
   feature engineering. Seg-GCRN can be trained efficiently for the i2b2/VA
   dataset on a GPU platform.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying a clinical
   multimodal radiomics nomogram based on ultrasonography (US) and
   multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the prediction of
   cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma
   (PTC) preoperatively. We performed retrospective evaluations of 133
   patients with pathologically confirmed PTC, who were assigned to the
   training cohort and validation cohort (7:3), and extracted radiomics
   features from the preoperative US, T2-weighted (T2WI),diffusion-weighted
   (DWI), and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1WI) images. Optimal
   subsets were selected using minimum redundancy, maximum relevance, and
   recursive feature elimination in the support vector machine (SVM). For
   LNM prediction, the radiomics model was constructed by SVM, and
   Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) was used for the
   effective classification of multiradiomics data. Multivariable logistic
   regression incorporating multiradiomics signatures and clinical risk
   factors was used to generate a nomogram, whose performance and clinical
   utility were assessed. Results showed that the nine most predictive
   features were separately selected from US, T2WI, DWI, and CE-T1WI
   images, and 18 features were selected in the combined model. The
   combined radiomics model showed better performance than models based on
   US, T2WI, DWI, and CE-T1WI. In a comparison of the combined radiomics
   and MOGONET model, receiver operating curve analysis showed that the
   area under the curve (AUC) value (95% CI) was 0.84 (0.76-0.93) and 0.84
   (0.71-0.96) for the MOGONET model in the training and validation
   cohorts, respectively. The corresponding values (95% CI) for the
   combined radiomics model were 0.82 (0.74-0.90) and 0.77 (0.61-0.94),
   respectively. The MOGONET model had better performance and better
   prediction specificity compared with the combined radiomics model. The
   nomogram including the MOGONET signature showed a better predictive
   value (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.88) in the training and validation (AUC: 0.74vs.
   0.87) cohorts, as compared with the clinical model. Calibration curves
   showed good agreement in both cohorts. The applicability of the clinical
   multimodal radiomics (CMR) nomogram in clinical settings was validated
   by decision curve analysis. In patients with PTC, the CMR nomogram could
   improve the prediction of cervical LNM preoperatively and may be helpful
   in clinical decision-making.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is commonly influenced by
   convolution neural networks (CNNs). However, the large number of
   parameters and computational complexity associated with CNNs can limit
   their practical application, particularly when computing and storage
   resources are limited. To address this challenge, we propose a
   channel-layer-oriented lightweight network for HSI classification.
   Motivated by existing structures that typically set large channels and
   stack multiple layers, we give more optimal solutions strategically to
   further compress the model. For intralayer feature extraction, we
   develop a channel-oriented spectral-spatial module (COS2M), which
   introduces a dual-single-channel (DSC) 3-D convolution that works in
   conjunction with depthwise convolution to fully extract spectral-spatial
   information. For interlayer information transmission, we propose a novel
   neighbor-pixel-aware activation function (NPAF), where the activation of
   a single pixel is determined by the learnable interaction with its
   neighbor range that enhances information transmission and improves the
   network's fitting ability through the single activation layer. By
   implementing these strategies, we aim to overcome the limitations of
   traditional CNNs and enable efficient HSI classification within
   resource-constrained environments. The whole network is designed to be a
   compact end-to-end structure. It achieves better classification
   performance than other deep learning methods and lightweight models,
   even with limited training samples. The network parameters, model
   complexity, and inference time also demonstrate significant superiority,
   as confirmed by experiments on three benchmark datasets. The source
   codes are available publicly at: https://github.com/AchunLee/CLOLN_TGRS

AB Scene flow estimation is a fundamental task of autonomous driving.
   Compared with optical flow, scene flow can provide sufficient 3D motion
   information of the dynamic scene. With the increasing popularity of 3D
   LiDAR sensors and deep learning technology, 3D LiDAR-based scene flow
   estimation methods have achieved outstanding results on public
   benchmarks. Current methods usually adopt Multiple Layer Perceptron
   (MLP) or traditional convolution-like operation for feature extraction.
   However, the characteristics of point clouds are not exploited
   adequately in these methods, and thus some key semantic and geometric
   structures are not well captured. To address this issue, we propose to
   introduce graph convolution to exploit the structural features
   adaptively. In particular, multiple graph-based feature generators and a
   graph-based flow refinement module are deployed to encode geometric
   relations among points. Furthermore, residual connections are used in
   the graph-based feature generator to enhance feature representation and
   deep supervision of the graph-based network. In addition, to focus on
   short-term dependencies, we introduce a single gate-based recurrent unit
   to refine scene flow predictions iteratively. The proposed network is
   trained on the FlyingThings3D dataset and evaluated on the
   FlyingThings3D, KITTI, and Argoverse datasets. Comprehensive experiments
   show that all proposed components contribute to the performance of scene
   flow estimation, and our method can achieve potential performance
   compared to the recent approaches.

AB Phishing, a well-known cyber-attack practice has gained significant
   research attention in the cyber-security domain for the last two decades
   due to its dynamic attacking strategies. Although different solutions
   have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically
   increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine
   learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and
   the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved
   anti-phishing tools' detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a
   new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent
   Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML
   features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful
   analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the
   anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a
   0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and
   the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered
   realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs
   inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content
   features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has
   outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a
   public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining
   to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be
   facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended
   period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.

AB Deep learning has achieved impressive results on hyperspectral image
   (HSI) classification. Among them, both convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have great potential for HSI
   classification. Supervised CNNs can efficiently extract hierarchical
   spatial-spectral features of HSIs, but these methods face the problem of
   high time complexity as the number of network layers increases.
   Semisupervised GNNs can rapidly capture the structural information of
   HSIs, while they cannot be well extended to HSI applications because of
   the process of adjacency matrix consuming large amount of memory
   resources. In this article, we propose a fast dynamic graph
   convolutional network and CNN (FDGC) parallel network for HSI
   classification. We first obtain two classification features by
   flattening and pooling operations on the results of the convolution
   layers, which fully exploits the spatial-spectral information contained
   in the hyperspectral data cube. Then, a dynamic graph convolution module
   is applied to extract the intrinsic structural information of each
   patch. Finally, we can obtain the HSI classification results based on
   these spatial, spectral, and structural features. By using three
   branches, FDGC can parallelly process multiple features of HSI in a
   supervised learning manner. In addition, regularization techniques, such
   as DropBlock and label smoothing, are applied to further improve the
   generalization capability of the model. Experimental results on three
   datasets show that our proposed algorithm is comparable with the
   state-of-the-art supervised learning models in terms of accuracy while
   also significantly outperforming in terms of training and inference
   time.

AB Fundus photography has been widely used for inspecting eye disorders by
   ophthalmologists or computer algorithms. Biomarkers related to retinal
   vessels plays an essential role to detect early diabetes. To quantify
   vascular biomarkers or the corresponding changes, an accurate artery and
   vein classification is necessary. In this work, we propose a new
   framework to boost local vessel classification with a global vascular
   network model using graph convolution. We compare our proposed method
   with two traditional state-of-the-art methods on a testing dataset of
   750 images from the Maastricht Study. After incorporating global
   information, our model achieves the best accuracy of 86.45% compared to
   85.5% from convolutional neural networks (CNN) and 82.9% from
   handcrafted pixel feature classification (HPFC). Our model also obtains
   the best area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
   0.95, compared to 0.93 from CNN and 0.90 from HPFC. The new
   classification framework has the advantage of easy deployment on top of
   local classification features. It corrects the local classification
   error by minimizing global classification error and it brings free
   additional classification performance.

AB Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical task in intelligent
   transportation, aiming to match vehicle images of the same identity
   captured by non-overlapping cameras. However, it is difficult to achieve
   satisfactory results based on RGB images alone in darkness. Therefore,
   it is of great importance to consider multi-modality vehicle
   re-identification. Currently, the proposed works deal with different
   modality features through direct summation and fusion based on heat map,
   which however ignores the relationship between them. Meanwhile, there is
   a huge gap between the different modalities, which needs to be reduced.
   In this paper, to solve the above two problems, we propose a Graph-based
   Progressive Fusion Network (GPFNet) using a graph convolutional network
   to adaptively fuse multi-modality features in an end-to-end learning
   framework. GPFNet consists of a CNN feature extraction module (FEM), a
   GCN feature fusion module (FFM), and a loss function module (LFM).
   Firstly, in FEM, we employ a multi-stream network architecture to
   extract single-modality features and common-modality features and employ
   a random modality substitution module to extract mixed-modality
   features. Secondly, in FFM, we design an efficient graph structure to
   associate the features of different modalities and adopt a progressive
   two-stage strategy to fuse them. Finally, in LFM, we use GCN-aware
   multi-modality loss to constrain the features. For reducing modality
   differences and contributing better initial mixed-modality features to
   FFM, we propose random modality substitution as a data enhancement
   method for multi-modality datasets. Extensive experiments on
   multi-modality vehicle Re-ID datasets RGBN300 and RGBNT100 show that our
   model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB As one of the critical branches of medical image processing, the task of
   segmentation of breast cancer tumors is of great importance for planning
   surgical interventions, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Breast cancer
   tumor segmentation faces several challenges, including the inherent
   complexity and heterogeneity of breast tissue, the presence of various
   imaging artifacts and noise in medical images, low contrast between the
   tumor region and healthy tissue, and inconsistent size of the tumor
   region. Furthermore, the existing segmentation methods may not fully
   capture the rich spatial and contextual information in small-sized
   regions in breast images, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
   paper, we propose a novel breast tumor segmentation method, called the
   transformer and graph convolutional neural (TS-GCN) network, for medical
   imaging analysis. Specifically, we designed a feature aggregation
   network to fuse the features extracted from the transformer, GCN and
   convolutional neural network (CNN) networks. The CNN extract network is
   designed for the image's local deep feature, and the transformer and GCN
   networks can better capture the spatial and context dependencies among
   pixels in images. By leveraging the strengths of three feature
   extraction networks, our method achieved superior segmentation
   performance on the BUSI dataset and dataset B. The TS-GCN showed the
   best performance on several indexes, with Acc of 0.9373, Dice of 0.9058,
   IoU of 0.7634, F1 score of 0.9338, and AUC of 0.9692, which outperforms
   other state-of-the-art methods. The research of this segmentation method
   provides a promising future for medical image analysis and diagnosis of
   other diseases.

AB Long-range regulatory interactions among genomic regions are critical
   for controlling gene expression, and their disruption has been
   associated with a host of diseases. However, when modeling the effects
   of regulatory factors, most deep learning models either neglect
   long-range interactions or fail to capture the inherent 3D structure of
   the underlying genomic organization. To address these limitations, we
   present a Graph Convolutional Model for Epigenetic Regulation of Gene
   Expression (GC-MERGE). Using a graph-based framework, the model
   incorporates important information about long-range interactions via a
   natural encoding of genomic spatial interactions into the graph
   representation. It integrates measurements of both the global genomic
   organization and the local regulatory factors, specifically histone
   modifications, to not only predict the expression of a given gene of
   interest but also quantify the importance of its regulatory factors. We
   apply GC-MERGE to data sets for three cell lines-GM12878
   (lymphoblastoid), K562 (myelogenous leukemia), and HUVEC (human
   umbilical vein endothelial)-and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
   predictive performance. Crucially, we show that our model is
   interpretable in terms of the observed biological regulatory factors,
   highlighting both the histone modifications and the interacting genomic
   regions contributing to a gene's predicted expression. We provide model
   explanations for multiple exemplar genes and validate them with evidence
   from the literature. Our model presents a novel setup for predicting
   gene expression by integrating multimodal data sets in a graph
   convolutional framework. More importantly, it enables interpretation of
   the biological mechanisms driving the model's predictions.

AB Although deep learning-based approaches have made significant progress
   in remote sensing (RS) image classification, the supervised learning
   paradigm has shortcomings under a limited number of labeled samples,
   which restricts the classification performance to a great extent. In
   this article, we investigate an effective self-supervised feature
   representation (SSFR) architecture for multimodal RS images' few-shot
   land cover classification. Specifically, we exploit a multiview learning
   strategy to construct multiple views from multimodal RS images. This
   method builds several complementary views of the same observed scenes
   from hyperspectral images or different modalities of RS data. Then, we
   build the deep feature extractor to learn high-level feature
   representations from each view via contrastive learning. Contrastive
   learning aggregates the samples of the same scene while separating
   samples of different scenes in the latent space, and this process does
   not require any labeled information. What is more, to learn more robust
   features from different views, we utilize multitask learning strategy to
   train the feature extraction network. Finally, a lightweight machine
   learning method is employed to classify the learned features using a few
   annotated samples. To further demonstrate the self-supervised feature
   learning capability of the proposed model, we train the feature
   representation network in multiple source datasets. Comprehensive
   feature learning and classification experiments have certified the
   effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB The composition and arrangement of spatial entities, i.e., land cover
   objects, play a key role in distinguishing land use types from very high
   resolution (VHR) remote sensing images, in particular in urban
   environments. This paper presents a new method to characterize the
   spatial arrangement for urban land use extraction using VHR images. We
   derive an adjacency unit matrix to represent the spatial arrangement of
   land cover objects obtained from a VHR image, and use a graph
   convolutional network to quantify the spatial arrangement by extracting
   hidden features from adjacency unit matrices. The distribution of the
   spatial arrangement variables, i.e., hidden features, and the spatial
   composition variables, i.e., widely used land use indicators, are then
   estimated. We use a Bayesian method to integrate the variables of
   spatial arrangement and composition for urban land use extraction.
   Experiments were conducted using three VHR images acquired in two urban
   areas: a Pleiades image in Wuhan in 2013, a Superview image in Wuhan in
   2019, and a GeoEye image in Oklahoma City in 2012. Our results show that
   the proposed method provides an effective means to characterize the
   spatial arrangement of land cover objects, and produces urban land use
   extractions with overall accuracies (i.e., 86% and 93%) higher than
   existing methods (i.e., 83% and 88%) that use spatial arrangement
   information based on building types on the Pleiades and GeoEye datasets.
   Moreover, it is unnecessary to further categorize the dominant land
   cover type into finer types for the characterization of spatial
   arrangement. We conclude that the proposed method has a high potential
   for the characterization of urban structure using different VHR images,
   and for the extraction of urban land use in different urban areas.

AB Vessel segmentation is widely used to help with vascular disease
   diagnosis. Vessels reconstructed using existing methods are often not
   sufficiently accurate to meet clinical use standards. This is because 3D
   vessel structures are highly complicated and exhibit unique
   characteristics, including sparsity and anisotropy. In this paper, we
   propose a novel hybrid deep neural network for vessel segmentation. Our
   network consists of two cascaded subnetworks performing initial and
   refined segmentation respectively. The second subnetwork further has two
   tightly coupled components, a traditional CNN-based U-Net and a graph
   U-Net. Cross-network multi-scale feature fusion is performed between
   these two U-shaped networks to effectively support high-quality vessel
   segmentation. The entire cascaded network can be trained from end to
   end. The graph in the second subnetwork is constructed according to a
   vessel probability map as well as appearance and semantic similarities
   in the original CT volume. To tackle the challenges caused by the
   sparsity and anisotropy of vessels, a higher percentage of graph nodes
   are distributed in areas that potentially contain vessels while a higher
   percentage of edges follow the orientation of potential nearby vessels.
   Extensive experiments demonstrate our deep network achieves
   state-of-the-art 3D vessel segmentation performance on multiple public
   and in-house datasets.

AB Semantic segmentation in aerial imagery is still an important, yet
   challenging task due to the complex characteristics of remote-sensing
   data. The critical issues consist of: 1) extreme foreground-background
   imbalance; 2) large intra-class variance; and 3) arbitrary-oriented,
   dense, and small objects. The above challenges make it unlikely to model
   the effective global interdependencies of semantic heterogeneous
   regions. Besides, general semantic segmentation methods suffer from
   feature ambiguity due to the joint feature learning paradigm, leading to
   inferior detail information. In this article, we propose an improved
   semantic segmentation framework to tackle these problems via graph
   reasoning (GR) and disentangled learning. On the one hand, a simple, yet
   effective GR unit is introduced to implement coordinate-interaction
   space mapping and perform relation reasoning over the graph. It can be
   deployed on the feature pyramid network (FPN) to exploit cross-stage
   multi-scale information. On the other hand, we propose a so- called
   disentangled learning paradigm to explicitly model the foreground and
   boundary objects, instantiated as foreground prior estimation (FPE) and
   boundary alignment (BA). The indication of the intermediate feature can
   be effectively emphasized to enhance the discriminative abilities of the
   network. Extensive experiments over iSAID, ISPRS Vaihingen, and the
   general Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of the proposed framework over other state-of-the-art semantic
   segmentation methods.

AB The transformer has become a prominent technique for hyperspectral image
   (HSI) classification, attributed to its capability to model global
   dependencies between features. Nevertheless, the predominant
   transformer-based methods rely on a direct information flow with a fixed
   number of tokens, causing the sequential transformer encoders to lack
   crucial interaction. This deficiency results in an inappropriate
   granularity of discriminative features and the loss of subtle patterns.
   In response to this limitation, we introduce a novel approach named
   multilevel class token transformer (MCTT) with cross tokenmixer for HSI
   classification. Specifically, we explore a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) stem network that incorporates 3-D, 2-D, and pointwise
   convolutions to encode local spatial-spectral information. The
   spectral-spatial features undergo transformation into semantic tokens
   using a semantic tokenizer. These tokens are then input into the
   transformer encoder to capture global interactions between different
   pixels. To create a hierarchical semantic representation, we propose a
   cross tokenmixer that integrates different levels of class tokens and
   patch tokens, enabling a multigrained representation. The cross
   tokenmixers, with their varied number of tokens, facilitate the learning
   of distinct discriminative spectral-spatial representations and enable a
   comprehensive understanding of the HSI through a voting mechanism.
   Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on three public
   HSI datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The
   results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our
   approach in HSI classification.

AB Supervised cross-modal retrieval has significant advantages in retrieval
   efficiency and storage cost. In the field of hashing retrieval, existing
   supervised methods are divided into single-label and multi-label
   methods. For the single-label method, simply using a single label to
   measure the semantic relevance between instances will cause an error in
   supervision information. However, the existing multi-label hashing
   methods also have some problems. For example, only considering the
   co-occurrence of multiple labels among instances may not accurately
   reflect their similarity. At the same time, in the previous methods, the
   text modality processing did not reach the fine level of image modality,
   resulting in insufficient use of text information. To address these
   issues, we proposed Non-co-occurrence enhanced Multi-label cross-modal
   hashing retrieval based on Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN). Firstly,
   we introduced a multi-label non-co-occurrence similarity measurement
   method, which adds multi-label non-co-occurrence information among
   instances in the multi-label similarity measurement to measure the
   differences between instances; Secondly, we used Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCNS) to process the information on text modality; Thirdly, we
   introduced the memory mechanism to restrict the difference of hash code
   learning. Many experiments show that the proposed method has excellent
   performance. In three widely used datasets (NUS-WIDE, MIRFlickr-25k,
   IAPR TC-12), MAP performance in image-text and text-image tasks was
   significanlty improved by about 8%, 9%, and 7%, respectlively.

AB Cross-lingual spoken language understanding (cross-lingual SLU), as a
   key component of task-oriented dialogue systems, is widely used in
   various industrial and real-world scenarios, such as multilingual
   customer support systems, cross-border communication platforms, and
   international language learning tools. However, obtaining large-scale
   and high-quality datasets for SLU is challenging due to the high cost of
   dialogue collection and manual annotation, particularly for minority
   languages. As a result, there is increasing interest in leveraging
   high-resource language data for cross-lingual transfer learning.
   Existing approaches for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU primarily focus on
   the relationship between the source language sentence and the single
   generated cross-lingual sentence, disregarding the shared information
   among multiple languages. This limitation weakens the robustness of
   multilingual word embedding representations and hampers the scalability
   of the model. In this paper, we propose the multilingual mixture
   attention interaction framework with adversarial training to alleviate
   the above problems. Specifically, we leverage the source language
   sentence to generate multiple multilingual hybrid sentences, in which
   words can adaptively capture unambiguous representations from the
   aligned multilingual words during the encoding phase, and adversarial
   training is introduced to enhance the scalability of the model. Then, we
   incorporate the symmetric kernel self-attention module with positional
   embedding to learn contextual information within a sentence, and employ
   the multi-relation graph convolutional networks to learn different
   granularity information between two highly correlated intent detection
   and slot filling tasks. Experimental results on the public dataset
   MultiATIS++ demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
   state-of-the-art performance, and comprehensive analysis validates the
   effectiveness of each component.

AB Dynamic visual vending machines are rapidly growing in popularity,
   offering convenience and speed to customers. However, there is a
   prevalent issue with consumers damaging goods and then returning them to
   the machine, severely affecting business interests. This paper addresses
   the issue from the standpoint of defect detection. Although existing
   industrial defect detection algorithms, such as PatchCore, perform well,
   they face challenges, including handling goods in various orientations,
   detection speeds that do not meet real-time monitoring requirements, and
   complex backgrounds that hinder detection accuracy. These challenges
   hinder their application in dynamic vending environments. It is crucial
   to note that efficient visual features play a vital role in memory
   banks, yet current memory repositories for industrial inspection
   algorithms do not adequately address the problem of location-specific
   feature redundancy. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a
   novel defect detection algorithm for goods using adaptive subsampling
   and partitioned memory banks. Firstly, Grad-CAM is utilized to extract
   deep features, which, in combination with shallow features, mitigate the
   impact of complex backgrounds on detection accuracy. Next, graph
   convolutional networks extract rotationally invariant features. The
   adaptive subsampling partitioned memory bank is then employed to store
   features of non-defective goods, which reduces memory consumption and
   enhances training speed. Experimental results on the MVTec AD dataset
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a marked improvement in
   detection speed while maintaining accuracy that is comparable to
   state-of-the-art models.

AB Traditional Euclidean spatial data processing is difficult to capture
   the inherent relationships of unstructured data such as bearing
   vibration signals. Representing vibration signals in graphical form
   helps to preserve their topological structure and temporal information.
   Secondly, most existing graph convolutional network methods are based on
   large graph structured data, which incurs certain memory overhead when
   aggregating high-order neighborhood node information and ignores
   important information between samples in the global graph structure. To
   address these issues, this paper proposes a high-order multi-head graph
   attention network based on an adaptive small graph structure
   (ASG-HOMGAT) for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. Firstly, the
   adaptive preprocessing layer is used to adaptively denoise and compress
   the one-dimensional time-domain vibration signal, generating small rule
   graph data with topological structure. Then, these small graph
   structured data samples are input into a higher-order graph neural
   network, which aggregates features from multiple higher-order
   neighborhoods to achieve richer feature representations and fully
   explore the intrinsic correlation between samples. Finally, these
   features are aggregated into a reinforced representation of graph nodes
   through a multi head attention mechanism, and a SoftMax classifier is
   used for fault classification. The experimental results show that the
   ASG-HOMGAT method has better performance compared to mainstream graph
   neural network diagnostic models. The code and model will be released
   at: https://github.com/ding-ss/ASG-HOMGAT.

AB Water ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental conditions,
   including meteorological factors, which influence dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentrations, a critical indicator of water quality. However, the
   complex relationships between multiple meteorological factors from
   various sites and DO concentrations pose a significant challenge for
   accurate prediction. This study introduces an innovative framework for
   enhancing DO concentration predictions in water bodies by integrating
   multi-station meteorological data. We first construct a dynamic
   meteorological graph with station-specific factors as node features and
   geographic distances as edge weights. This graph is processed using a
   Geo-Contextual Graph Embedding Module, leveraging a Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) to distill geographical and meteorological features from
   multi-station data. Extracted features are encoded and then temporally
   merged with historical DO values to form time-series data. Finally, a
   Temporal Transformer module is used for future DO concentration
   predictions. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to
   traditional methods, successfully capturing the complex relationships
   between meteorological factors and DO levels. It provides an effective
   tool for environmental scientists and policymakers in water quality
   monitoring and management. This study suggests that the integration of
   graph-based learning and a Temporal Transformer in environmental
   modeling is a promising direction for future research.

AB With the prevalence of accessible depth sensors, dynamic skeletons have
   attracted much attention as a robust modality for action recognition.
   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at modeling local relations
   within local receptive fields and are typically inefficient at capturing
   global relations. In this article, we first view the dynamic skeletons
   as a spatio-temporal graph (STG) and then learn the localized correlated
   features that generate the embedded nodes of the STG by message passing.
   To better extract global relational information, a novel model called
   spatial-temporal graph interaction networks (STG-INs) is proposed, which
   perform long-range temporal modeling of human body parts. In this model,
   human body parts are mapped to an interaction space where graph-based
   reasoning can be efficiently implemented via a graph convolutional
   network (GCN). After reasoning, global relation-aware features are
   distributed back to the embedded nodes of the STG. To evaluate our
   model, we conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets.
   The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
   model, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as a promising

   bonded supramolecular complex via water-based homogeneous supramolecular
   assembly, which is a promising precursor to fabricate porous and
   oxygen-doped g-C3N4. The hydrothermal treatment provides a homogeneous
   environment for hydrolysis of melamine to produce cyanuric acid and
   reaction of cyanuric acid with remained melamine to create the in-plane
   ordering and hydrogen bonded supramolecular complex. The complex can
   template uniform nanoporous structure and also provide an opportunity

   g-C3N4(GCN-4) possesses high surface area, well-defined 3D morphology
   and oxygen-dopant in the lattice. Subsequently, the visible light
   absorption, charge separation, and wettability are considerably

AB Accurate traffic flow prediction is essential to building a smart
   transportation city. Existing research mainly uses a given single-graph
   structure as a model, only considers local and static spatial
   dependencies, and ignores the impact of dynamic spatio-temporal data
   diversity. To fully capture the characteristics of spatio-temporal data
   diversity, this paper proposes a cross-Attention Fusion Based
   Spatial-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network (CAFMGCN) model for
   traffic flow prediction. First, introduce GCN to model the historical
   traffic data's three-time attributes (current, daily, and weekly) to
   extract time features. Second, consider the relationship between
   distance and traffic flow, constructing adjacency, connectivity, and
   regional similarity graphs to capture dynamic spatial topology
   information. To make full use of global information, a cross-attention
   mechanism is introduced to fuse temporal and spatial features separately
   to reduce prediction errors. Finally, the CAFMGCN model is evaluated,
   and the experimental results show that the prediction of this model is
   more accurate and effective than the baseline of other models.

   use the faces of the mesh as basic processing units and represent a 3D
   mesh as a graph where each node corresponds to a face. To enhance the
   descriptive power of the graph, we introduce a 1 ring face neighborhood
   structure to derive novel multi-dimensional spatial and structure
   features to represent the graph nodes. Based on this new graph
   representation, we then design a densely connected graph convolutional
   block which aggregates local and regional features as the key
   construction component to build effective and efficient practical GCN
   models for 3D object classification and segmentation. We present
   experimental results to show that our new technique performs comparably
   to state of the art across a number of benchmark datasets where our
   models are also shown to have smaller number of parameters. We also
   present ablation studies to demonstrate the soundness of our design
   principles and the effectiveness of our practical models. (c) 2021

AB Tailoring the interfacial interaction between metal species and supports
   in supported electrocatalysts is of great importance for enhanced
   electrocatalytic performance. Herein, a highly active interface was
   engineered in S-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SGCN)-supported Pt
   heterostructured electrocatalysts toward fast oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR). The coordination and electronic structure of Pt species is
   modulated with enhanced Pt-N bonding by S doping, which induces electron
   deficiency aacent C and N atoms a hence reinforces the metal-support
   interaction. The optimal 20Pt/SGCN-550 electrocatalyst exhibits
   excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V and a
   mass activity of 0.68 A mg(Pt)(-1), substantially surpassing that of
   20Pt/GCN and commercial Pt/C. Besides, the 20Pt/SGCN-550 electrocatalyst
   achieves decent durability due to the superb stability of SGCN and the
   strong confinement effect at the interface. This work not only advances
   the development of robust ORR electrocatalysts but also offers a
   strategy to engineer heterostructured electrocatalysts with tunable
   interface chemistry toward various catalytic applications.

AB The graph neural network (GNN) has become a popular research area for
   its state-of-the-art performance in many graph analysis tasks. Recently,
   various graph neural network libraries have emerged. They make
   developing GNNs convenient, but the performance bottlenecks of GNNs on
   large datasets are not well studied. In this work, we analyze the
   performance bottlenecks in GNN training and inference with GPUs
   empirically. A GNN layer can be decomposed into two parts: the vertex
   and the edge calculation parts. We select four representative GNNs (GCN,
   GGNN, GAT, GaAN) for evaluation according to their computational
   complexity. We decompose their running time and memory usage, evaluate
   the effects of hyper-parameters and assess the efficiency of the
   sampling techniques. The experimental evaluation with PyTorch Geometric
   indicates that the edge-related calculation is the performance
   bottleneck for most GNNs, dominating the training/inference time and
   memory usage. The sampling techniques are essential for GNN training and
   inference on big graphs with GPUs, but their current implementation
   still has non-trivial overheads in sampling and data transferring.

AB Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to address the limitation of
   symbolic representation of knowledge, has become an effective method for
   many AI downstream tasks, such as relation extraction, question
   answering. Existing knowledge graph embedding models mainly consider
   triples individually, and ignore the structural information connected
   with other entities. However, the connectivity between entities not only
   provides explicit structural information represented in triples, but
   also embodies a lot of implicit structure information. In this paper, a
   new knowledge graph embedding model is proposed, which can capture both
   the information of relational structure-context and edge
   structure-context by two-interaction. In addition, in order to model
   complex relations, we define different score function for different
   relation types. Moreover, the four relation connectivity types in
   knowledge graph (i.e. symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition)
   also can be modeled and inferred by StructurE. We evaluate our StructurE
   for knowledge graph link prediction task. Benefiting from the structural
   context and the relation-type-specific score function, compared with
   conventional geometric transformation based knowledge graph embedding
   models StructurE achieves state-of-the-art results for link prediction.
   Moreover, compared with GCN-based models StructurE also achieves
   state-of-the-art results on more challenging dataset WN18RR which
   contains more symmetric relations. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Anomaly detection is a critical technique that ensures the reliability
   of WSNs. However, most existing anomaly detectionmethods only consider
   the case of single modal data flow anomaly detection for each node or
   multiple modal time series data flowanomaly detection for a single node
   and do not consider the case of multiple nodes and multiple time series
   data flow simultaneously,and it limited the ability of anomaly
   detection. In this paper, a novel anomaly detection model is proposed
   for multimodal WSN data flows. First, the temporal features and modal
   correlation features extracted from each sensor node are fused into one
   vectorrepresentation, then it is further aggregated with the spatial
   features represented the spatial position relationship of the nodes;
   finally,the current time-series data of WSN nodes are predicted, and
   abnormal states are identified according to the fusion features.
   Thesimulation results obtained on a public dataset show that the
   proposed approach can significantly improve upon existing methods
   interms of robustness, and its F1 score reaches 0.90, which is 14.2%
   higher than that of the graph convolution network (GCN) with
   longshort-term memory (LSTM).

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great power in learning on
   graphs. However, it is still a challenge for GNNs to model information
   faraway from the source node. The ability to preserve global information
   can enhance graph representation and hence improve classification
   precision. In the paper, we propose a new learning framework named G-GNN
   (Global information for GNN) to address the challenge. First, the global
   structure and global attribute features of each node are obtained via
   unsupervised pre-training, and those global features preserve the global
   information associated with the node. Then, using the pre-trained global
   features and the raw attributes of the graph, a set of parallel kernel
   GNNs is used to learn different aspects from these heterogeneous
   features. Any general GNN can be used as a kernal and easily obtain the
   ability of preserving global information, without having to alter their
   own algorithms. Extensive experiments have shown that state-of-the-art
   models, e.g., GCN, GAT, Graphsage and APPNP, can achieve improvement
   with G-GNN on three standard evaluation datasets. Specially, we
   establish new benchmark precision records on Cora (84.31%) and Pubmed
   (80.95%) when learning on attributed graphs.

AB Background: Capmatinib, a potent and selective MET inhibitor, is an
   effective treatment option for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations or gene amplification.
   However, the mechanisms that confer resistance to capmatinib remain
   elusive. Here, we present a case of primary resistance to capmatinib in
   a MET-amplified NSCLC patient which was conferred by concurrent Case
   Description: Capmatinib was administered as first-line treatment in an
   82-year-old METamplified (Gene Copy Number (GCN) 13.5) and MET
   overexpressed (immunohistochemical staining 3+/3, >50%) NSCLC patient.
   However, the tumor rapidly progressed and showed primary resistance to
   capmatinib. Next-generation target sequencing using rebiopsy tumor
   samples revealed MYC amplification. We also performed functional drug
   susceptibility testing using patient-derived cells (PDCs), which showed
   overexpression of MYC mRNA and resistance to capmatinib. Meanwhile,
   ICX-101, an investigational MYC inhibitor, successfully inhibited the
   growth of PDCs at a relatively low IC50 value. Also, a synergistic
   effect was shown when capmatinib treatment was followed by ICX-101.
   Conclusions: Concurrent MYC amplification could potentially confer
   primary resistance to capmatinib in highly MET amplified NSCLC patients.
   Further clinical studies are warranted to corroborate these findings,
   and treatment with MYC inhibitors could be suggested as an alternative
   therapeutic strategy for this subset of patients.

AB Deep clustering is a promising technique for speech separation that is
   crucial to speech communication, acoustic target detection, acoustic
   enhancement and speech recognition. In the study of monophonic speech
   separation, the problem is that the decrease in separation and
   generalization performance of the model in the case of reducing the
   variety of the training data set. In this paper, we propose a
   comprehensive deep clustering framework that construction the structural
   speech data based on GCN, named graph deep clustering (GDC) to further
   improve the separation performance of the separation model. In
   particular, embedding features are transformed into graph-structured
   data, and the speech separation mask is achieved by clustering these
   graph-structured data. Graph structural information aggregates nodes
   within a class, which makes feature representations conducive to
   clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
   can improve the clustering performance. The SDR of the separated speech
   is improved by about 1.2 dB, and the clustering accuracy is improved by
   15 & x0025;. We also use the perceptually motivated objective measures
   for the evaluation of audio source separation to score the speech
   quality. The target speech quality and the overall perceptual score are
   improved by 10.7 & x0025; compared with other speech separation
   algorithms.

AB Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are time-synchronized measurement
   devices that have been proliferated in transmission networks during the
   last two decades. Recently, there have been efforts to bring this
   technology to distribution grids for different applications such as
   three-phase state estimation, fault and event analyses, and phase
   identification. Streamed time-synchronized voltage and current phasor
   data can be used for events classification and region identification
   along distribution feeders to determine the type and location of events,
   which are important features of any fault and event detection, location,
   and isolation software. In this paper, the spectral theory-based graph
   convolution is used for event classification and region identification.
   The proposed model uses modified graph convolution filters to aggregate
   the regional multi-rate samples of PMU data, i.e., voltage magnitude and
   angles from several nodes. Besides these temporal data of the measured
   nodes, the physical configuration of the network containing edge
   features are given to the graph convolution network (GCN) to not only
   classify the event type, but also identify the affected region and
   location. The proposed graph-based method is tested on a standard test
   system with capacitor and distributed energy resources-related events,
   malfunction of voltage regulator, sudden load changes, and different
   types of faults. The results are compared with baseline methods,
   Chebyshev graph neural network (GNN), decision tree, logistic regression
   and K-nearest neighbor using the accuracy, recall, precision and F-1
   score metrics. Furthermore, performance sensitivity analysis is carried
   out with respect to the number of installed PMUs, measurement noise
   level, size of available historical data, availability of network edge
   features, and different designs of GNN.

AB Leucine rich repeat LGI family member 3 (LGI3) is a member of the LGI
   protein family. Our previous studies reported that LGI3 was expressed in
   adipose tissues, brain and skin, where it served roles as a
   multifunctional cytokine and pro-inflammatory adipokine. It was
   hypothesized that LGI3 may be involved in cytokine networks in cancer.
   The present study aimed to analyze differentially expressed genes in
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and NSCLC cohort data, to
   evaluate the prognostic role of LGI3. Expression microarray and NSCLC
   cohort data were statistically analyzed by bioinformatic methods, and
   protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and pathway, gene
   coexpression network (GCN) and prognostic association analyses were
   performed. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of LGI3
   and its receptor a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
   protein 22 were significantly decreased in NSCLC tissues. A total of two
   upregulated genes and 11 downregulated genes in NSCLC tissues were
   identified as LGI3-regulated genes. Protein-protein interaction network
   analysis demonstrated that all LGI3-regulated genes that were altered in
   NSCLC were involved in a protein-protein interaction network cluster.
   Functional enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
   and GCN analyses demonstrated the association of these genes with the
   immune and inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, the tumor necrosis
   factor pathway, and chemokine and peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor signaling pathways. Analysis of NSCLC cohorts revealed that low
   expression levels of LGI3 was significantly associated with poor
   prognosis of NSCLC. Analysis of the somatic mutations of the LGI3 gene
   in NSCLC revealed that the amino acid residues altered in NSCLC included
   two single nucleotide polymorphism sites and three phylogenetically
   coevolved amino acid residues. Taken together, these results suggest
   that LGI3 may be a potential prognostic marker of NSCLC.

AB Multimedia-based recommendation (MMRec) is a challenging task, which
   goes beyond the collaborative filtering (CF) schema that only captures
   collaborative signals from interactions and explores multimodal user
   preference cues hidden in complex multimedia content. Despite the
   significant progress of current solutions for MMRec, we argue that they
   are limited by multimodal noise contamination. Specifically, a
   considerable amount of preference-irrelevant multimodal noise (e.g., the
   background, layout, and brightness in the image of the product) is
   incorporated into the representation learning of items, which
   contaminates the modeling of multimodal user preferences. Moreover, most
   of the latest researches are based on graph convolution networks (GCNs),
   which means that multimodal noise contamination is further amplified
   because noisy information is continuously propagated over the user-item
   interaction graph as recursive neighbor aggregations are performed. To
   address this problem, instead of the common MMRec paradigm which learns
   user preferences in an integrated manner, we propose a hierarchical
   framework to separately learn collaborative signals and multimodal
   preferences cues, thus preventing multimodal noise from flowing into
   collaborative signals. Then, to alleviate the noise contamination for
   multimodal user preference modeling, we propose to extract semantic
   entities from multimodal content that are more relevant to user
   interests, which can model semantic-level multimodal preferences and
   thus remove a large fraction of noise. Furthermore, we use the full
   multimodal features to model content-level multimodal preferences like
   the existing MMRec solutions, which ensures the sufficient utilization
   of multimodal information. Overall, we develop a novel model, multimodal
   hierarchical graph CF (MHGCF), which consists of three types of GCN
   modules tailored to capture collaborative signals, semantic-level
   preferences, and content-level preferences, respectively. We conduct
   extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of MHGCF and its
   components. The complete data and codes of MHGCF are available at.

AB Inferring missing links in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a key evaluation
   task for KG reasoning, which aims to find relations for a given entity
   pair. Existing research often employs the IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)
   algorithm for the path discovery task owing to its efficiency and
   accuracy. However, it relies on heuristics to set cost functions and is
   also difficult to utilize useful context information in the search
   process. In this paper, we propose the Deep-IDA* framework which applies
   neural networks and reinforcement learning (RL) to empower the IDA*
   algorithm to tackle the path discovery problem in KG reasoning. We model
   KG reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and divide our Deep-IDA*
   framework and the resulting path into two parts: path-finding and
   path-reasoning. For path-finding, we propose a policy network to model
   the cost from the source to a candidate location. In this process, we
   employ the GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) to embed the observable
   sub-track, then employ the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to record the
   historical trajectory, and introduce the attention to utilize the
   context information, and finally form policy. For path-reasoning with
   the searched candidate paths passed from the former process, we employ a
   value network to estimate the cost from the candidate to the destination
   entity, using the GNN (Graph Neural Networks) to learn a message-passing
   algorithm that solves the path inference problem, and using the GRU
   (Gated Recurrent Unit) to update the historical information. Finally,

AB Novel per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the environment and
   populations have received extensive attention; however, their
   distribution and potential toxic effects in the general population
   remain unclear. Here, a comprehensive study on PFAS screening was
   carried out in serum samples of 202 individuals from the general
   population in four cities in China. A total of 165 suspected PFASs were
   identified using target and nontarget analysis, including seven
   identified PFAS homolog series, of which 16 PFASs were validated against
   standards, and seven PFASs [4:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether
   sulfonate (4:2 ClPFESA), 7:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate
   (7:2 Cl-PFESA), hydrosubstituted perfluoroheptanoate (H-PFHpA),
   chlorine-substituted perfluorooctanoate (Cl-PFOA), chlorine-substituted
   perfluorononanate (Cl-PFNA), chlorine-substituted perfluorodecanoate
   (Cl-PFDA), and perfluorodecanedioic acid (PFLDCA n = 8)] were reported
   for the first time in human serum. The Tox21-GCN model (a graph
   convolutional neural network model based on the Tox21 database) was
   established to predict the toxicity of the discovered PFASs, revealing
   that PFASs containing sulfonic acid groups exhibited multiple potential
   toxic effects, such as estrogenic effects and stress responses. Our
   study indicated that the general population was exposed to various
   PFASs, and the toxicity prediction results of individual PFASs suggested
   potential health risks that could not be ignored.

AB Transformers have demonstrated remarkable accomplishments in several
   natural language processing (NLP) tasks as well as image processing
   tasks. Herein, we present a deep-learning (DL) model that is capable of
   improving the semantic segmentation network in two ways. First,
   utilizing the pre-training Swin Transformer (SwinTF) under Vision
   Transformer (ViT) as a backbone, the model weights downstream tasks by
   joining task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Secondly, decoder
   designs are applied to our DL network with three decoder designs, U-Net,
   pyramid scene parsing (PSP) network, and feature pyramid network (FPN),
   to perform pixel-level segmentation. The results are compared with other
   image labeling state of the art (SOTA) methods, such as global
   convolutional network (GCN) and ViT. Extensive experiments show that our
   Swin Transformer (SwinTF) with decoder designs reached a new state of
   the art on the Thailand Isan Landsat-8 corpus (89.8% F1 score), Thailand
   North Landsat-8 corpus (63.12% F1 score), and competitive results on
   ISPRS Vaihingen. Moreover, both our best-proposed methods (SwinTF-PSP
   and SwinTF-FPN) even outperformed SwinTF with supervised pre-training
   ViT on the ImageNet-1K in the Thailand, Landsat-8, and ISPRS Vaihingen
   corpora.

AB Conventional image retrieval techniques for Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
   are limited in their ability to effectively distinguish symmetric or
   repetitive textured patterns and cannot guarantee an accurate generation
   of pairwise matches without costly redundancy. In this paper, we
   formulate the image retrieval task as a node binary classification
   problem with graph data: if a candidate node is marked as positive, it
   is believed to share the same scene with the query image. The key idea
   of our approach is that the local context in the feature space around a
   query image contains abundant information about the matchable relation
   between the image and its neighbours. By constructing a subgraph
   surrounding the query image as input data, we adopt a learnable Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) to deter-mine whether nodes in the subgraph
   have overlapping regions with the query photograph. Experiments
   demonstrate that our method performs remarkably well on a challenging
   dataset of highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Furthermore, compared
   with state -of-the-art matchable retrieval methods, the proposed
   approach significantly reduces unnecessary attempted matches without
   sacrificing the accuracy and completeness of reconstruction. (c) 2021

AB Exploring multimorbidity relationships among diseases is of great
   importance for understanding their shared mechanisms, precise diagnosis
   and treatment. However, the landscape of multimorbidities is still far
   from complete due to the complex nature of multimorbidity. Although
   various types of biological data, such as biomolecules and clinical
   symptoms, have been used to identify multimorbidities, the population
   phenotype information (e.g. physical activity and diet) remains less
   explored for multimorbidity. Here, we present a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) model, named MorbidGCN, for multimorbidity prediction by
   integrating population phenotypes and disease network. Specifically,
   MorbidGCN treats the multimorbidity prediction as a missing link
   prediction problem in the disease network, where a novel feature
   selection method is embedded to select important phenotypes.
   Benchmarking results on two large-scale multimorbidity data sets, i.e.
   the UK Biobank (UKB) and Human Disease Network (HuDiNe) data sets,
   demonstrate that MorbidGCN outperforms other competitive methods. With
   MorbidGCN, 9742 and 14 010 novel multimorbidities are identified in the
   UKB and HuDiNe data sets, respectively. Moreover, we notice that the
   selected phenotypes that are generally differentially distributed
   between multimorbidity patients and single-disease patients can help
   interpret multimorbidities and show potential for prognosis of
   multimorbidities.

AB 3D hand shape and pose estimation from a single depth map is a new and
   challenging computer vision problem with many applications. Existing
   methods addressing it directly regress hand meshes via 2D convolutional
   neural networks, which leads to artifacts due to perspective distortions
   in the images. To address the limitations of the existing methods, we
   develop HandVoxNet++, i.e., a voxel-based deep network with 3D and graph
   convolutions trained in a fully supervised manner. The input to our
   network is a 3D voxelized-depth-map-based on the truncated signed
   distance function (TSDF). HandVoxNet++ relies on two hand shape
   representations. The first one is the 3D voxelized grid of hand shape,
   which does not preserve the mesh topology and which is the most accurate
   representation. The second representation is the hand surface that
   preserves the mesh topology. We combine the advantages of both
   representations by aligning the hand surface to the voxelized hand shape
   either with a new neural Graph-Convolutions-based Mesh Registration
   (GCN-MeshReg) or classical segment-wise Non-Rigid Gravitational Approach
   (NRGA++) which does not rely on training data. In extensive evaluations
   on three public benchmarks, i.e., SynHand5M, depth-based HANDS19
   challenge and HO-3D, the proposed HandVoxNet++ achieves the
   state-of-the-art performance. In this journal extension of our previous
   approach presented at CVPR 2020, we gain 41.09% and 13.7% higher shape
   alignment accuracy on SynHand5M and HANDS19 datasets, respectively. Our
   method is ranked first on the HANDS19 challenge dataset (Task 1:
   Depth-Based 3D Hand Pose Estimation) at the moment of the submission of
   our results to the portal in August 2020.

AB To explain how cartilage appeared in different parts of the vertebrate
   body at discrete times during evolution, we hypothesize that different
   embryonic populations co-opted expression of a core gene regulatory
   network (GRN) driving chondrocyte differentiation. To test this
   hypothesis, laser-capture microdissection coupled with RNA-seq was used
   to reveal chondrocyte transcriptomes in the developing chick humerus and
   ceratobranchial, which are mesoderm- and neural crest-derived,
   respectively. During endochondral ossification, two general types of
   chondrocytes differentiate. Immature chondrocytes (IMM) represent the
   early stages of cartilage differentiation, while mature chondrocytes
   (MAT) undergo additional stages of differentiation, including
   hypertrophy and stimulating matrix mineralization and degradation. Venn
   diagram analyses generally revealed a high degree of conservation
   between chondrocyte transcriptomes of the limb and head, including SOX9,
   COL2A1, and ACAN expression. Typical maturation genes, such as COL10A1,
   IBSP, and SPP1, were upregulated in MAT compared to IMM in both limb and
   head chondrocytes. Gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses of limb and
   head chondrocyte transcriptomes estimated the core GRN governing
   cartilage differentiation. Two discrete portions of the GCN contained
   genes that were differentially expressed in limb or head chondrocytes,
   but these genes were enriched for biological processes related to
   limb/forelimb morphogenesis or neural crest-dependent processes,
   respectively, perhaps simply reflecting the embryonic origin of the
   cells. A core GRN driving cartilage differentiation in limb and head was
   revealed that included typical chondrocyte differentiation and
   maturation markers, as well as putative novel "chondrocyte" genes.
   Conservation of a core transcriptional program during chondrocyte
   differentiation in both the limb and head suggest that the same core GRN
   was co-opted when cartilage appeared in different regions of the
   skeleton during vertebrate evolution.

AB To further improve the effect of gene modules identification, combining
   the Newman algorithm in community detection and K-means algorithm
   framework, a new method of gene module identification, GCNA-Kpca
   algorithm, was proposed. The core idea of the algorithm was to build a
   gene co-expression network (GCN) based on gene expression data firstly;
   Then the Newman algorithm was used to initially identify gene modules
   based on the topology of GCN, and the number of clusters and clustering
   centers were determined; Finally the number of clusters and clustering
   centers were input into the K-means algorithm framework, and the
   secondary clustering was performed based on the gene expression profile
   to obtain the final gene modules. The algorithm took into account the
   role of modularity in the clustering process, and could find the optimal
   membership module for each gene through multiple iterations.
   Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper
   had the best performance in error rate, biological significance and CNN
   classification indicators (Precision, Recall and F-score). The gene
   module obtained by GCNA-Kpca was used for the task of key gene
   identification, and these key genes had the highest prognostic
   significance. Moreover, GCNA-Kpca algorithm was used to identify 10 key
   genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): CDC20, CCNB1, EIF4A3, H2AFX,
   NOP56, RFC4, NOP58, AURKA, PCNA, and FEN1. According to the validation,
   it was reasonable to speculate that these 10 key genes could be
   biomarkers for HCC. And NOP56 and NOP58 are key genes for HCC that we
   discovered for the first time.

AB Traditional collaborative filtering based recommender systems generally
   suffer from the interaction data sparsity problem. Therefore, social
   recommendation is proposed to mitigate the issue and improve
   recommendation performance by introducing social information. Existing
   social recommendation studies primarily focus on the direct connections
   between users, such as friendship or users' correlation. Unfortunately,
   there often is a severe data sparsity issue in above social data as
   well, which limits the performance of these models. In contrast,
   user-group relationships, another valuable social information that is
   formed by users joining the groups they are interested in, have received
   insufficient attention. In this paper, we focus on this relationship,
   demonstrate its excellent effectiveness in alleviating the problem of
   data sparsity, and integrate it into our recommendation model IGRec
   (Integrating user Group relationships for social Recommendation) in a
   reasonable way. Specifically, to address the problem that existing
   group-information-enhanced methods have not modeled users' collaborative
   interests and social influence in depth, we reformulate the available
   data into two bipartite graphs: user-item graph and user-group graph.
   And then employ more robust high-order GCN-based model combining a
   multi-layer attention mechanism to learn user and item representation
   from two graphs. Furthermore, we notice that due to the high complexity
   of user-group networks, the interests of some users in the same group
   may be far different, especially in those large-scale groups. The
   indiscriminate use of high-order neighbors' information in user-group
   graph may result in the introduction of negative information during the
   embedding propagation. Thus, to obtain a more precise representation for
   user and item, we propose to constrain the graph convolution operations
   at the social side inside subgraphs composed of users with similar
   interests and the groups they have joined in our model. Finally,
   experimental results on three real-world datasets clearly show the
   effectiveness of our proposed model. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The recent methods for cross-network node classification mainly exploit
   graph neural networks (GNNs) as feature extractor to learn expressive
   graph representations across the source and target graphs. However, GNNs
   are vulnerable to noisy factors, such as adversarial attacks or
   perturbations on the node features or graph structure, which can cause a
   significant negative impact on their learning performance. To this end,
   we propose a robust graph domain adaptive learning framework RGDAL which
   exploits an information-theoretic principle to filter the noisy factors
   for cross-network node classification. Specifically, RGDAL utilizes
   graph convolutional network (GCN) with constrained graph mutual
   information and an adversarial learning component to learn
   noise-resistant and domain -invariant graph representations. To overcome
   the difficulties of estimating the mutual information for the non
   independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) graph structured
   data, we design a dynamic neighborhood sampling strategy that can
   discretize the graph and incorporate the graph structural information
   for mutual information estimation. Experimental results on two
   real-world graph datasets demonstrate that RGDAL shows better robustness
   for cross-network node classification compared with the SOTA graph
   adaptive learning methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simple Summary With the development of circRNA-miRNA-mediated models,
   circRNAs have been shown to play a prominent role in the development and
   treatment of diseases such as cancer, and unearthing potential
   miRNA-associated circRNAs may provide new insights and ideas for the
   diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases such as cancer. Large-scale
   prediction using computer technology can provide an a priori guide to
   biological experiments and save costs. This paper presents the third
   computational method in this field with the highest accuracy to date,
   and we also collected and integrated high-quality datasets from the
   current database, which we believe will allow future computational
   innovations to develop. Computational prediction of miRNAs, diseases,
   and genes associated with circRNAs has important implications for
   circRNA research, as well as provides a reference for wet experiments to
   save costs and time. In this study, SGCNCMI, a computational model
   combining multimodal information and graph convolutional neural
   networks, combines node similarity to form node information and then
   predicts associated nodes using GCN with a distributive contribution
   mechanism. The model can be used not only to predict the molecular level
   of circRNA-miRNA interactions but also to predict circRNA-cancer and
   circRNA-gene associations. The AUCs of circRNA-miRNA, circRNA-disease,
   and circRNA-gene associations in the five-fold cross-validation
   experiment of SGCNCMI is 89.42%, 84.18%, and 82.44%, respectively.
   SGCNCMI is one of the few models in this field and achieved the best
   results. In addition, in our case study, six of the top ten relationship
   pairs with the highest prediction scores were verified in PubMed.

AB Spatio-temporal prediction has drawn much attention given its wide
   application, of which traffic flow prediction is a typical task. Within
   the vision of smart cities, traffic flow predic-tion plays a vital role
   in traffic control and optimization. The current approaches commonly use
   a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture any spatial correlations
   and a recur-rent neural network (RNN) to mine any temporal correlations.
   However, GCNs cannot detect spatial heterogeneity and time-varying
   spatial correlations, and RNNs cannot model the periodicity of traffic
   series data. Further, iterative training of RNNs may come at a high
   computational cost and result in problems with error propagation. To
   this end, we propose STSSN, a spatio-temporal sequence-to-sequence
   network, that not only explores heteroge-neous and time-varying spatial
   correlations, but also efficiently exploits sequential and periodic
   temporal correlations. STSSN is based on an encoder-decoder framework.
   In the network, the model's input is processed to extract the periodic
   daily and weekly patterns in traffic flows. Both the encoder and decoder
   mainly consist of an enhanced diffusion con-volutional network (EDCN)
   and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). In the EDCN mod-ule, the
   diffusion convolution incorporates time-varying node representations so
   as to capture both node-specific patterns and time-varying spatial
   correlations. In the TCN mod-ule, we take full advantage of the parallel
   computing in the dilated causal convolution to mine local (short-term)
   temporal correlations. More importantly, global (long-term) tem-poral
   correlations are discovered through an encoder-decoder attention (EDA)
   module. This EDA mechanism directly models the relationship between the
   encoder and decoder to mitigate problems with error propagation.
   Experiments on two real-world datasets ver-ify the superiority of STSSN,
   with STSSN's MAE at between 3.85% -6.17% lower than the state-of-the-art
   baselines on the PEMS-BAY dataset.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB With the significant importance of riboflavin (RF) in food, biological,
   and pharmaceutical areas, precisely determining its level is critical
   for regulating health and nutrition, diagnosis/treatment of related
   diseases, pharmacological research, and food/drug quality monitoring.
   Thus, the sensitive and accurate determination of RF is necessary.
   Herein, we construct facile and low-cost ruthenium (Ru) doped cobalt
   phosphide (R-CoP) embedded graphitic carbon nitride as an electrode
   modifier via a two-step synthesis method. By the virtue of its unique
   physiochemical properties such as high active surface area (69.43
   m(2)/g) compares to similar electrocatalyst and high electron transfer
   kinetics with low charge transfer resistance (R-ct = 367.89 omega), it
   has been successfully employed in the electrochemical evaluation of RF.
   In this regard, it has been effectively employed in the electrochemical
   evaluation of RF through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometric (i t)
   techniques. The proposed R-CoP/GCN/GCE sensor shows exquisite
   electrochemical characteristics including a wide linear range (0.062 -
   3468.75 mu M), Nanomolar detection limit (1.09 nM), and encouraging
   sensitivity (1.277 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)). Moreover, it also exemplifies
   exquisite selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, and storage
   stability therefore it has been employed in the practical feasibility
   analysis in various real samples which shows excellent recovery results.
   On comparing, it exemplifies excellent electrochemical performance than
   the similar electrocatalyst in the electrochemical sensing of biological
   compounds in various real samples.

AB Background Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are powerful tools that
   enable biologists to examine associations between genes during different
   biological processes. With the advancement of new technologies, such as
   single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), there is a need for developing
   novel network methods appropriate for new types of data. Results We
   present a novel sparse Bayesian factor model to explore the network
   structure associated with genes in scRNA-seq data. Latent factors impact
   the gene expression values for each cell and provide flexibility to
   account for common features of scRNA-seq: high proportions of zero
   values, increased cell-to-cell variability, and overdispersion due to
   abnormally large expression counts. From our model, we construct a GCN
   by analyzing the positive and negative associations of the factors that
   are shared between each pair of genes. Conclusions Simulation studies
   demonstrate that our methodology has high power in identifying gene-gene
   associations while maintaining a nominal false discovery rate. In real
   data analyses, our model identifies more known and predicted
   protein-protein interactions than other competing network models.

AB The disease image recognition models based on deep learning have
   achieved relative success under limited and restricted conditions, but
   such models are generally subjected to the shortcoming of weak
   robustness. The model accuracy would decrease obviously when recognizing
   disease images with complex backgrounds under field conditions.
   Moreover, most of the models based on deep learning only involve
   characterization learning on visual information in the image form, while
   the expression of other modal information rather than the image form is
   often ignored. The present study targeted the main invasive diseases in
   tomato and cucumber as the research object. Firstly, in response to the
   problem of weak robustness, a feature decomposition and recombination
   method was proposed to allow the model to learn image features at
   different granularities so as to accurately recognize different test
   images. Secondly, by extracting the disease feature words from the
   disease text description information composed of continuous vectors and
   recombining them into the disease graph structure text, the graph
   convolutional neural network (GCN) was then applied for feature
   learning. Finally, a vegetable disease recognition model based on the
   fusion of images and graph structure text was constructed. The results
   show that the recognition accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and
   specificity of the proposed model were 97.62, 92.81, 98.54, and 93.57%,
   respectively. This study improved the model robustness to a certain
   extent, and provides ideas and references for the research on the fusion
   method of image information and graph structure information in disease
   recognition.

   performance. Numerous reviews of the literature have been done, but
   rarely have these reviews concentrated on skeleton-graph-based
   approaches. Connecting the skeleton joints as in the physical appearance
   can naturally generate a graph. This paper provides an up-to-date review
   for readers on skeleton graph-neural-network-based human action
   recognition. After analyzing previous related studies, a new taxonomy
   for skeleton-GNN-based methods is proposed according to their designs,
   and their merits and demerits are analyzed. In addition, the datasets
   and codes are discussed. Finally, future research directions are

AB Salinity stress tolerance is a complex polygenic trait involving
   multi-molecular pathways. This study aims to demonstrate an effective
   transcriptomic approach for identifying genes regulating salt tolerance
   in rice. The chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of "Khao Dawk
   Mali 105 (KDML105)" rice containing various regions of DH212 between
   markers RM1003 and RM3362 displayed differential salt tolerance at the
   booting stage. CSSL16 and its nearly isogenic parent, KDML105, were used
   for transcriptome analysis. Differentially expressed genes in the leaves
   of seedlings, flag leaves, and second leaves of CSSL16 and KDML105 under
   normal and salt stress conditions were subjected to analyses based on
   gene co-expression network (GCN), on two-state co-expression with
   clustering coefficient (CC), and on weighted gene co-expression network
   (WGCN). GCN identified 57 genes, while 30 and 59 genes were identified
   using CC and WGCN, respectively. With the three methods, some of the
   identified genes overlapped, bringing the maximum number of predicted
   salt tolerance genes to 92. Among the 92 genes, nine genes, OsNodulin,
   OsBTBZ1, OsPSB28, OsERD, OsSub34, peroxidase precursor genes, and three
   expressed protein genes, displayed SNPs between CSSL16 and KDML105. The
   nine genes were differentially expressed in CSSL16 and KDML105 under
   normal and salt stress conditions. OsBTBZ1 and OsERD were identified by
   the three methods. These results suggest that the transcriptomic
   approach described here effectively identified the genes regulating salt
   tolerance in rice and support the identification of appropriate QTL for
   salt tolerance improvement.

AB Carbon nitride is widely used in photocatalytic hydrogen production, but
   it is still difficult to split water without any sacrificial reagent.
   Herein, nanosized Fe2O3 is combined with 3D nitrogen-rich carbon nitride
   tubes (ACN), to form an Fe2O3@ACN Z-scheme heterojunction, which
   accelerates the electrons' transfer from Fe2O3 to ACN and improves the
   charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the bandgap of Fe2O3@ACN is
   about 2.01 eV, beneficial to the enhancement of visible light absorption
   capacity. As a result, without any sacrificial agent, the hydrogen
   evolution rate reaches 3.7 mu mol h(-1) (10 mg catalyst, AM1.5) through
   water splitting, which is three times that of ACN and 45 times that of
   bulk C3N4 (GCN). This work provides a new strategy to prompt pure water
   splitting based on carbon nitride catalysts.

AB Large-scale multi-label image classification requires determining the
   presence or absence of a target object in a large number of sample
   images. For highly specialized and complex multi-label image sets, it is
   especially important to ensure the accuracy of image classification.
   Traditional deep learning models usually don't take into account
   image-label correlation constraints when classifying multi-label images,
   and the strategy of classifying images based only on their own features
   greatly limits the model performance. In this context, this paper
   focuses a deep learning-based cluster analysis method for large-scale
   multi-label images. We constructed a model for large-scale multi-label
   image category recognition, which consists of a global image feature
   extraction module, a feature activation vector generation module and an
   image category inter-label connection module. Using a graph
   convolutional network (GCN), we aggregated the information of image
   category label nodes in the constructed multi-label graph structure,
   while exploring the correlation between image category labels. A
   detailed description is presented on how to introduce the attention
   mechanism into the constructed model mentioned above for image category
   recognition. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of
   the constructed model.

AB Crowd flow prediction is an essential task benefiting a wide range of
   applications for the transportation system and public safety. However,
   it is a challenging problem due to the complex spatio-temporal
   dependence and the complicated impact of urban structure on the crowd
   flow patterns. In this article, we propose a novel framework,
   3-Dimensional Graph Convolution Network (3DGCN), to predict citywide
   crowd flow. We first model it as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph
   prediction problem, where each node represents a region with
   time-varying flows, and each edge represents the origin-destination (OD)
   flow between its corresponding regions. As such, OD flows among regions
   are treated as a proxy for the spatial interactions among regions. To
   tackle the complex spatio-temporal dependence, our proposed 3DGCN can
   model the correlation among graph spatial and temporal neighbors
   simultaneously. To learn and incorporate urban structures in crowd flow
   prediction, we design the GCN aggregator to be learned from both crowd
   flow prediction and region function inference at the same time.
   Extensive experiments with real-world datasets in two cities demonstrate
   that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.6%similar to
   19.5% for the next-time-interval prediction.

AB Person re-identification (re-id) aims to identity the same person over
   multiple cameras; it has been successfully applied to various computer
   vision applications as a fundamental method. Owing to the development of
   deep learning, person re-id methods, which typically use triplet
   networks based on triplet loss, have demonstrated great success.
   However, the appearances of people are similar and hence difficult to
   distinguish in many cases. Therefore, we present a novel graph
   convolution network and enhances traditional triplet loss functions. Our
   method defines reference, positive, and negative features for triplet
   loss as three vertices of a graph, respectively, and adjusts their
   mutual distance through learning. The method adopts graph convolutions
   efficiently, thereby affording low computational costs. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our method is superior to the baseline on the
   Market-1501 dataset. The proposed GCN-based triplet loss considerably
   contributes to improve re-identification methods quantitatively and
   qualitatively.

AB Different synthesis temperatures (450-550 degrees C) were applied to
   synthesize g-C3N4 with the highest visible-light triggered
   photocatalytic activity. The best performing g-C3N4 photocatalyst was
   synthesized at 550 degrees C due to the created favourable structure
   that expressed the lowest band gap and charge carrier recombination
   rate. To further improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4,
   different g-C3N4/TiO2 (gCN/TNP) composites with varying weight
   concentrations of g-C3N4 and TiO2 were prepared. Charge carrier
   separation was enabled due to the injection of photogenerated electrons
   from the g-C3N4 conduction band (CB) to the TiO2 CB, where they reacted
   with water-dissolved oxygen to form reactive oxygen species. The best
   performing composite was 0.50gCN/TNP 2 h with 50 wt% of g-C3N4 and 2 h
   calcination at 350 degrees C. The improved photocatalytic activity is
   due to an appropriate ratio between the shielding effect of TiO2, higher
   contact area and the consecutive improvement of the charge carrier
   separation, which is the key determining factor.

AB Distantly supervised relation extraction is a prevalent technique for
   identifying semantic relations between two entities. Most prior models
   cannot distinguish the local and global information in the long-range
   dependency among words effectively. The latent semantic information
   presented in existing knowledge graphs is completely neglected, as the
   knowledge graph information is simply used as a label to specify the
   class of relations instead of being treated as a graph. Moreover,
   previous studies only utilized a selective attention mechanism over
   sentences to alleviate the impact of noise; they did not consider the
   implicit interaction between sentences in a sentence bag. In this paper,
   (1) we propose a knowledge-aware framework to enhance word
   representations, which can highlight the importance of key words and
   relation clues; (2) we adopt a piecewise self-attention mechanism to
   model long-range dependency among words; (3) we design a heterogeneous
   graph structure for each sentence bag and introduce a heterogeneous
   graph convolutional network with knowledge attention to aggregate the
   implicit interaction among sentences from a local-to-global perspective.
   Experimental results on two popular relation extraction datasets
   demonstrate that our model obtains more discriminative relation
   representations and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art models. (C)

   utilize graph neural network to aggregate the neighboring information
   between marking-points. Without any manually designed post-processing,
   the proposed method is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments have
   been conducted on public benchmark dataset, where the proposed method

AB Triplet repeat diseases (TRDs) refer to a group of diseases caused by
   three nucleotide repeats elongated beyond a pathologic threshold. TRDs
   are divided into the following four groups depending on the
   pathomechanisms, although the pathomechanisms of several diseases remain
   unelucidated: polyglutamine disorders, caused by a pathologic repeat
   expansion of CAG (coding the amino acid glutamine) located within the
   exon; loss-of-function repeat disorders, characterized by the common
   feature of a loss of function of the gene within which they occur; RNA
   gain-of-function disorders, involving the production of a toxic RNA
   species; and polyalanine disorders, caused by a pathologic repeat
   expansion of GCN (coding the amino acid alanine) located within the
   exon. Many of these TRDs manifest through neurologic symptoms; moreover,
   neuroimaging, especially brain magnetic resonance imaging, plays a
   pivotal role in the detection of abnormalities, differentiation, and
   management of TRDs. In this article, we reviewed the clinical and
   neuroimaging features of TRDs. An early diagnosis of TRDs through
   clinical and imaging approaches is important and may contribute to
   appropriate medical intervention for patients and their families.

AB There has been a surge of recent interest in graph representation
   learning (GRL). GRL methods have generally fallen into three main
   categories, based on the availability of la-beled data. The first,
   network embedding, focuses on learning unsupervised representations of
   relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks,
   leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization
   objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural
   networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete
   topolo-gies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of
   these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the
   three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between network
   embedding, graph regularization and graph neural networks. We pro-pose a
   comprehensive taxonomy of GRL methods, aiming to unify several disparate
   bodies of work. Specifically, we propose the GRAPHEDM framework, which
   generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning (e.g.
   GraphSage, GCN, GAT), and unsupervised learning (e.g. DeepWalk,
   node2vec) of graph representations into a single consistent ap-proach.
   To illustrate the generality of GRAPHEDM, we fit over thirty existing
   methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both
   provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these
   methods, and enables future research in the area.

AB Aim We propose a novel graph rank-based average pooling neural network
   (GRAPNN) to detect secondary pulmonary tuberculosis patients via chest
   CT imaging. Methods First, we propose a novel rank-based pooling neural
   network (RAPNN) to learn the individual image-level features from chest
   CT images. Second, we integrate the graph convolutional network (GCN),
   which learns relation-aware representation among the batch of chest CT
   images, to RAPNN. Third, we build a novel Graph RAPNN (GRAPNN) model
   based on the previous integration via k-means clustering and k-nearest
   neighbors' algorithm. Besides, an improved data augmentation is utilized
   to handle overfitting problem. Grad-ACM is used to make this GRAPNN
   model explainable. Results This proposed GRAPNN method is compared with
   seven state-of-the-art algorithms. The results showed GRAPNN model
   yields the best performances with a sensitivity of 94.65%, a specificity
   of 95.12%, a precision of 95.17%, an accuracy of 94.88%, and an F1 score
   of 94.87%. Conclusions Our GRAPNN is superior to other seven
   state-of-the-art approaches. The explainable mechanism in our method can
   identify the lesions of important lung parts (tuberculosis cavities and
   surrounding small lesions) for transparent decision.

AB Defect engineering is an effective path to prune the performance of
   photocatalysts but are rarely reported in graphene-semiconductor
   composites. Here, the few-layered graphene materials with different
   defect contents are obtained through facile alkali-assisted
   "cutting-thin" technique. Meanwhile, the monolayer graphene with low
   defect content is also synthesized on a variety of biomasses via the
   same uncomplicated process. Importantly, the defects in few-layered
   graphene have been established as an important platform to research the
   relationship between catalytic activity and defect. Therefore, a series
   of graphene-GCN photocatalysts with different defect contents were
   prepared by the wet-chemistry synthesis process. Compared to more
   defects and less content of defects, the optimal defect content displays
   greatly improved H-2 production rate. Therefore, a suitable defect
   content in graphene can not only increase the photogenerated electron
   transport, but also hinder the photoinduced electron recombination. This
   successful application of defect engineering is awaited to furnish
   guidance for intelligent contexture of graphene-based photocatalyst for
   extensive uptake in other directions, including photoelectrochemical
   sensors, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

AB Proteins are the fundamental biological macromolecules which underline
   practically all biological activities. Protein-protein interactions
   (PPIs), as they are known, are how proteins interact with other proteins
   in their environment to perform biological functions. Understanding PPIs
   reveals how cells behave and operate, such as the antigen recognition
   and signal transduction in the immune system. In the past decades, many
   computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs automatically,
   requiring less time and resources than experimental techniques. In this
   paper, we present a comparative study of various graph neural networks
   for protein-protein interaction prediction. Five network models are
   analyzed and compared, including neural networks (NN), graph
   convolutional neural networks (GCN), graph attention networks (GAT),
   hyperbolic neural networks (HNN), and hyperbolic graph convolutions
   (HGCN). By utilizing the protein sequence information, all of these
   models can predict the interaction between proteins. Fourteen PPI
   datasets are extracted and utilized to compare the prediction
   performance of all these methods. The experimental results show that
   hyperbolic graph neural networks tend to have a better performance than
   the other methods on the protein-related datasets.

AB The adversarial attack methods based on gradient information can
   adequately find the perturbations, that is, the combinations of rewired
   links, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the deep learning
   model-based graph embedding algorithms, but it is also easy to fall into
   a local optimum. Therefore, this article proposes a momentum gradient
   attack (MGA) against the graph convolutional network (GCN) model, which
   can achieve more aggressive attacks with fewer rewiring links. Compared
   with directly updating the original network using gradient information,
   integrating the momentum term into the iterative process can stabilize
   the updating direction, which makes the model jump out of poor local
   optimum and enhances the method with stronger transferability.
   Experiments on node classification and community detection methods based
   on three well-known network embedding algorithms show that MGA has a
   better attack effect and transferability.

AB Learning to infer missing links is one of the fundamental tasks in the
   knowledge graph. Instead of reasoning based on separate paths in the
   existing methods, in this paper, we propose a new model, Sequential
   Relational Graph Convolutional Network (SRGCN), which treats the
   multiple paths between an entity pair as a sequence of subgraphs.
   Specifically, to reason the relationship between two entities, we first
   construct a graph for the entities based on the knowledge graph and
   serialize the graph to a sequence. For each hop in the sequence,
   Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) is then applied to update
   the embeddings of the entities. The updated embedding of the tail entity
   contains information of the entire graph, hence the relationship between
   two entities can be inferred from it. Compared to the existing
   approaches that deal with paths separately, SRGCN treats the graph as a
   whole, which can encode structural information and interactions between
   paths better. Experiments show that SRGCN outperforms path-based
   baselines on both link and fact prediction tasks. We also show that
   SRGCN is highly efficient in the sense that only one epoch of training
   is enough to achieve high accuracy, and even partial datasets can lead
   to competitive performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset intractable
   myopathy, characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and
   proximal limb weakness. It is caused by the abnormal expansion of the
   alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in the exon 1 of the
   polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene (11-18 repeats in
   OPMD instead of the normal 10 repeats). As the disease progresses, the
   patients gradually develop a feeling of suffocation, regurgitation of
   food, and aspiration pneumonia, although the initial symptoms and the
   progression patterns vary among the patients. Autologous myoblast
   transplantation may provide therapeutic benefits by reducing swallowing
   problems in these patients. Therefore, it is important to assemble
   information on such patients for the introduction of effective
   treatments in nonendemic areas. Herein, we present a concise review of
   recent progress in clinical and pathological studies of OPMD and
   introduce an idea for setting up a nation-wide OPMD disease registry in
   Japan. Since it is important to understand patients' unmet medical
   needs, realize therapeutically targetable symptoms, and identify indices
   of therapeutic efficacy, our attempt to establish a unique patient
   registry of OPMD will be a helpful tool to address these urgent issues.

AB Tracking the behaviour of animals in group-housed situations is a
   critical area of study for precision livestock farming, but it poses
   challenges in diverse and crowded environments. Existing methods often
   struggle with false positives and false negatives due to the
   complexities of these scenarios. In this study, we propose a robust
   computer vision algorithm for long-term (>10mins) animal tracking, with
   a primary focus on group-housed pigs. Our method addresses the
   limitations of current approaches by effectively handling errors from
   the detector in challenging environments. Our approach integrates Graph
   Convolutional Networks.(GCNs) with deep learning-based object detection
   techniques. We represent the data as a graph structure, with nodes
   corresponding to multiple animal detections over several frames. Edges
   connect the detections that do not appear in the same frame. The model's
   objective is to perform edge classification, where each edge is
   associated with a scalar representing the probability of being the same
   object. To enhance the robustness of edge classification, we combine the
   classifier with an ensemble predictor, enabling accurate tracking of
   animal identities for extended periods. Notably, our graph convolutional
   model achieves accurate re identification of non-consecutive animal
   detections in real-time without the need for trajectory prediction or ID
   association. We evaluate our method by comparing its performance against
   other tracking methods, including DeepSORT-a state-of-the-art animal
   tracking method that relies on a Kalman filter, a deep appearance
   descriptor, and the Hungarian algorithm for trajectory prediction and ID
   association. Our comparison demonstrates the advantages of our method,
   as it (1) improves the IDF1 score, indicating enhanced ID association
   accuracy, by 1.72%; (2) mitigates 93% of errors resulting from ID-switch
   and deviation; (3) extends the tracking duration of each animal by
   approximately 66% in challenging conditions; and (4) achieves a
   processing speed that is 1000 times faster than DeepSORT when operating
   at 22fps with the detector. The potential applications of our method
   extend to various aspects of livestock management. By accurately
   tracking individual animals, we can monitor behaviours such as feeding,
   drinking, and aggressive interactions. This information can lead to
   improvements in animal welfare, resource allocation, and breeding
   strategies. Follow-ups of this research are available at:

AB Facial reenactment is aimed at animating a source face image into a new
   place using a driving facial picture. In a few shot scenarios, the
   present strategies are designed with one or more identities or
   identity-sustained suffering protection challenges. These current
   solutions are either developed with one or more identities in mind, or
   face identity protection issues in one or more shot situations. Multiple
   pictures from the same entity have been used in previous research to
   model facial reenactment. In contrast, this paper presents a novel model
   of one-shot many-to-many facial reenactments that uses only one facial
   image of a face. The proposed model produces a face that represents the
   objective representation of the same source identity. The proposed
   technique can simulate motion from a single image by decomposing an
   object into two layers. Using bi-layer with Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN), we named our model Bi-Layer Graph Convolutional Layers (BGCLN)
   which utilized to create the latent vector's optical flow
   representation. This yields the precise structure and shape of the
   optical stream. Comprehensive studies suggest that our technique can
   produce high-quality results and outperform most recent techniques in
   both qualitative and quantitative data comparisons. Our proposed system
   can perform facial reenactment at 15 fps, which is approximately real
   time. Our code is publicly available at

AB Due to the inherent vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs), the
   adversarial example (AE) attack has become a serious threat to
   intelligent systems, e.g., the failure cause of an image classification
   system. Different to existing works, in this article we are interested
   in the generation of AEs for DNNs with defensive mechanisms. To make the
   attack more practical, we exploit a query-based method to generate image
   AEs in a black-box attack setting. Considering that the generation of
   AEs is inherently a constrained optimization problem, this article first
   formulates three objectives regarding defensive DNNs, i.e., attack
   effectiveness, attack evasiveness and attack coverage. Then, this
   article proposes a query-efficient AE attack based on the genetic
   algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address the
   perturbation optimization problem. To improve the efficiency of search
   and query, AE-specific operators including block-level and pixel-level
   crossovers, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven
   reproduction are designed within the GA-based search framework. In
   addition, predication-based adaptation of reproduction-related
   parameters is implemented to speed up the search convergence. PSO-based
   jumping process is further devised to avoid stuck in local optimum.
   Benchmark-based experiments evaluated the efficiency of our method,
   which can achieve an attack success rate of 100% with averagely 52.95%
   reduced queries in contrast to existing black-box attacks on
   nondefensive models. For defensive DNN models, our method can obtain top
   attack performance with the query reduction up to 70.92% comparing with
   the candidates.

AB BACKGROUND: To establish a predictive model based on multisequence
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using deep learning to identify
   wild-type (WT) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), EGFR exon 19
   deletion (19Del), and EGFR exon 21-point mutation (21L858R)
   simultaneously.
   METHODS: A total of 399 patients with proven brain metastases of
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were retrospectively enrolled and
   divided into training (n = 306) and testing (n = 93) cohorts separately
   based on two timepoints. All patients underwent 3.0-T brain MRI
   including T2-weighted, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery,
   diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences.
   Radiomics features were extracted from each lesion based on four
   sequences. An algorithm combining radiomics approach with graph
   convolutional networks architecture (Radio-GCN) was designed for the
   prediction of EGFR mutation status and subtype. The area under the curve
   (AUC) at receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate
   the predication capabilities of each model.
   RESULTS: We extracted 1,290 radiomics features from each MRI sequence.
   The AUCs of the Radio-GCN model for identifying EGFR 19Del, 21L858R, and
   WT for the lesion-wise analysis were 0.996 ± 0.004, 0.971 ± 0.013, and
   1.000 ± 0.000 on the independent testing cohort separately. It also
   yielded AUCs of 1.000 ± 0.000, 0.991 ± 0.009, and 1.000 ± 0.000for
   predicting EGFR mutations respectively for the patient-wise analysis.
   The kappa coefficients were 0.735 and 0.812, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The constructed Radio-GCN model is a new potential tool to
   predict the EGFR mutation status and subtype in NSCLC patients with
   brain metastases.
   RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The study demonstrated that a deep learning
   approach based on multisequence MRI can help to predict the EGFR
   mutation status in NSCLC patients with brain metastases, which is
   beneficial to guide a personalized treatment.
   KEY POINTS:  This is the first study to predict the EGFR mutation
   subtype simultaneously.  The Radio-GCN model holds the potential to be
   used as a diagnostic tool.  This study provides an imaging surrogate for
   identifying the EGFR mutation subtype.

AB Non-stationarity of EEG signals leads to high variability between
   subjects, making it challenging to directly use data from other subjects
   (source domain) for the classifier in the current subject (target
   domain). In this study, we propose MI-DAGSC to address domain adaptation
   challenges in EEG-based motor imagery (MI) decoding. By combining
   domain-level information, class-level information, and inter-sample
   structure information, our model effectively aligns the feature
   distributions of source and target domains. This work is an extension of
   our previous domain adaptation work MI-DABAN (Li et al., 2023). Based on
   MI-DABAN, MI-DAGSC designs Sample-Feature Blocks (SFBs) and Graph
   Convolution Blocks (GCBs) to focus on intra-sample and inter-sample
   information. The synergistic integration of SFBs and GCBs enable the
   model to capture comprehensive information and understand the
   relationship between samples, thus improving representation learning.
   Furthermore, we introduce a triplet loss to enhance the alignment and
   compactness of feature representations. Extensive experiments on real
   EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MI-DAGSC, confirming that
   our method makes a valuable contribution to the MI-EEG decoding.
   Moreover, it holds great potential for various applications in
   brain-computer interface systems and neuroscience research. And the code
   of the proposed architecture in this study is available under

AB Background: Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) can be used to determine
   gene regulation and attribute gene function to biological processes.
   Different high throughput technologies, including one and two-channel
   microarrays and RNA-sequencing, allow evaluating thousands of gene
   expression data simultaneously, but these methodologies provide results
   that cannot be directly compared. Thus, it is complex to analyze
   co-expression relations between genes, especially when there are missing
   values arising for experimental reasons. Networks are a helpful tool for
   studying gene co-expression, where nodes represent genes and edges
   represent co-expression of pairs of genes.
   Results: In this paper, we establish a method for constructing a gene
   co-expression network for the Anopheles gambiae transcriptome from 257
   unique studies obtained with different methodologies and experimental
   designs. We introduce the sliding threshold approach to select node
   pairs with high Pearson correlation coefficients. The resulting network,
   which we name AgGCN1.0, is robust to random removal of conditions and
   has similar characteristics to small-world and scale-free networks.
   Analysis of network sub-graphs revealed that the core is largely
   comprised of genes that encode components of the mitochondrial
   respiratory chain and the ribosome, while different communities are
   enriched for genes involved in distinct biological processes.
   Conclusion: Analysis of the network reveals that both the architecture
   of the core sub-network and the network communities are based on gene
   function, supporting the power of the proposed method for GCN
   construction. Application of network science methodology reveals that
   the overall network structure is driven to maximize the integration of
   essential cellular functions, possibly allowing the flexibility to add
   novel functions.

AB The construction industry is accident-prone, and unsafe behaviors of
   construction workers have been identified as a leading cause of
   accidents. One important countermeasure to prevent accidents is
   monitoring and managing those unsafe behaviors. The most popular way of
   detecting and identifying workers' unsafe behaviors is the computer
   vision-based intelligent monitoring system. However, most of the
   existing research or products focused only on the workers' behaviors
   (i.e., motions) recognition, limited studies considered the interaction
   between man-machine, man-material or man-environments. Those
   interactions are very important for judging whether the workers'
   behaviors are safe or not, from the standpoint of safety management.
   This study aims to develop a new method of identifying construction
   workers' unsafe behaviors, i.e., unsafe interaction between
   man-machine/material, based on ST-GCN (Spatial Temporal Graph
   Convolutional Networks) and YOLO (You Only Look Once), which could
   provide more direct and valuable information for safety management. In
   this study, two trained YOLO-based models were, respectively, used to
   detect safety signs in the workplace, and objects that interacted with
   workers. Then, an ST-GCN model was trained to detect and identify
   workers' behaviors. Lastly, a decision algorithm was developed
   considering interactions between man-machine/material, based on YOLO and
   ST-GCN results. Results show good performance of the developed method,
   compared to only using ST-GCN, the accuracy was significantly improved
   from 51.79% to 85.71%, 61.61% to 99.11%, and 58.04% to 100.00%,
   respectively, in the identification of the following three kinds of
   behaviors, throwing (throwing hammer, throwing bottle), operating
   (turning on switch, putting bottle), and crossing (crossing railing and
   crossing obstacle). The findings of the study have some practical
   implications for safety management, especially workers' behavior
   monitoring and management.

AB To increase the success in Covid 19 treatment, many drug suggestions are
   presented, and some clinical studies are shared in the literature. There
   have been some attempts to use some of these drugs in combination.
   However, using more than one drug together may cause serious side
   effects on patients. Therefore, detecting drug-drug interactions of the
   drugs used will be of great importance in the treatment of Covid 19. In
   this study, the interactions of 8 drugs used for Covid 19 treatment with
   645 different drugs and possible side effects estimates have been
   produced using Graph Convolutional Networks. As a result of the
   experiments, it has been found that the hematopoietic system and the
   cardiovascular system are exposed to more side effects than other
   organs. Among the focused drugs, Heparin and Atazanavir appear to cause
   more adverse reactions than other drugs. In addition, as it is known
   that some of these 8 drugs are used together in Covid-19 treatment, the
   side effects caused by using these drugs together are shared. With the
   experimental results obtained, it is aimed to facilitate the selection
   of the drugs and increase the success of Covid 19 treatment according to
   the targeted patient.

AB Knowledge tracing models have gained prominence in educational data
   mining, with applications like the Self-Attention Knowledge Tracing
   model, which captures the exercise-knowledge relationship. However,
   conventional knowledge tracing models focus solely on static
   question-knowledge and knowledge-knowledge relationships, treating them
   with equal significance. This simplistic approach often succumbs to
   subjective labeling bias and lacks the depth to capture nuanced
   exercise-knowledge connections. In this study, we propose a novel
   knowledge tracing model called Knowledge Relation Rank Enhanced
   Heterogeneous Learning Interaction Modeling for Neural Graph Forgetting
   Knowledge Tracing. Our model mitigates the impact of subjective labeling
   by fine-tuning the skill relation matrix and Q-matrix. Additionally, we
   employ Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to capture intricate
   interactions between students, exercises, and skills. Specifically, the
   Knowledge Relation Importance Rank Calibration method is employed to
   generate the skill relation matrix and Q-matrix. These calibrated
   matrices, alongside heterogeneous interactions, serve as input for the
   GCN to compute exercise and skill embeddings. Subsequently, exercise
   embeddings, skill embeddings, item difficulty, and contingency tables
   collectively contribute to an exercise relation matrix, which is then
   fed into an attention mechanism for predictions. Experimental
   evaluations on two publicly available educational datasets demonstrate
   the superiority of our proposed model over baseline models, evidenced by
   enhanced performance across three evaluation metrics.

AB Rumor source detection has long been an important but difficult problem.
   Due to the complexity of the underlying propagation model, most existing
   methods only rely on the limit observation of a single batch of single
   snapshot during the propagation process in the spatial graph networks,
   which neglects temporal dependency and temporal features of the rumor
   propagation process. Taking multiple batches of multiple snapshots as
   input can reveal the temporal dependency. Inspired by the traditional
   spatial-temporal graph convolution network (STGCN), which is a model
   that can combine spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we
   propose a STGCN based model called Spatio-Temporal Approximate
   Personalized Propagation of Neural Predictions (STAPPNP), which firstly
   learns both the spatial and temporal features automatically from
   multiple batches of multiple snapshots to locate the rumor source. As
   there are no input algorithms that are suitable for multiple batches of
   multiple snapshots to capture the feature of nodes' connectivity in
   STAPPNP, we develop an input algorithm to generate a 4-dimensional input
   matrix from the multiple batches of multiple snapshots to feed the
   proposed model. Nonetheless, for deep learning models, such input of
   multiple batches of multiple snapshots requires multiple convolutional
   layers to extract spatial features. Too many convolutional layers can
   lead to over-smoothing and long training time. To address these issues,
   we improve the Spatio-Temporal-Convolutional(ST-Conv) block, in which we
   adopt the approximate personalized propagation of neural predictions in
   the spatial convolutional layer of STAPPNP. Our experimental results
   show that the accuracy of the rumor source detection is improved by
   using STAPPNP, and the speed of the training process of STAPPNP
   outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning approaches under the popular
   epidemic susceptible-infected (SI) and susceptible-infected-recovery
   (SIR) models in social networks.

AB In the field of environmental science, traditional methods for
   predicting PM2.5 concentrations primarily focus on singular temporal or
   spatial dimensions. This approach presents certain limitations when it
   comes to deeply mining the joint influence of multiple monitoring sites
   and their inherent connections with meteorological factors. To address
   this issue, we introduce an innovative deep-learning-based multi-graph
   model using Beijing as the study case. This model consists of two key
   modules: firstly, the 'Meteorological Factor Spatio-Temporal Feature
   Extraction Module'. This module deeply integrates spatio-temporal
   features of hourly meteorological data by employing Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spatial and
   temporal encoding respectively. Subsequently, through an attention
   mechanism, it retrieves a feature tensor associated with air pollutants.
   Secondly, these features are amalgamated with PM2.5 concentration
   values, allowing the 'PM2.5 Concentration Prediction Module' to predict
   with enhanced accuracy the joint influence across multiple monitoring
   sites. Our model exhibits significant advantages over traditional
   methods in processing the joint impact of multiple sites and their
   associated meteorological factors. By providing new perspectives and
   tools for the in-depth understanding of urban air pollutant distribution
   and optimization of air quality management, this model propels us
   towards a more comprehensive approach in tackling air pollution issues.

AB This paper proposes a new method for blind mesh visual quality
   assessment (MVQA) based on a graph convolutional network. For that, we
   address the node classification problem to predict the perceived visual
   quality. First, two matrices representing the 3D mesh are considered: a
   graph adjacency matrix and a feature matrix. Both matrices are used as
   input to a shallow graph convolutional network. The network consists of
   two convolutional layers followed by a max-pooling layer to provide the
   final feature representation. With this structure, the Softmax
   classifier predicts the quality score category without the reference
   mesh's availability. Experiments are conducted on four publicly
   available databases constructed explicitly for the mesh quality
   assessment task. We investigate several perceptual and visual features
   to select the most effective combination. Comparisons with the
   state-of-the-art alternative methods show the effectiveness of the
   proposed framework.

AB Water distribution system monitoring is currently carried out using
   advanced real-time control technologies to achieve a higher operational
   efficiency. Data analysis techniques can be implemented for condition
   estimation, which are crucial tools for managing, developing, and
   operating water networks using the monitored flow rate and pressure data
   at some network pipes and nodes. This work proposes a state estimation
   methodology that enables one to infer the hydraulic state of the
   operating speed of pumping systems from these pressure and flow
   measurements. The presented approach suggests using graph convolutional
   neural network theory linked to hydraulic models for generating a
   digital twin of the water system. It is validated on two benchmark
   hydraulic networks: the Patios-Villa del Rosario, Colombia, and the
   C-Town networks. The results show that the proposed model effectively
   predicts the state estimation in the two hydraulic networks used. The
   results of the evaluation metrics indicate low values of mean squared
   error and mean absolute error and high values of the coefficient of
   determination, reflecting high predictive ability and that the
   prediction results adequately represent the real data.

AB With the increasing popularity of cab services such as Didi and Uber,
   cities are faced with the challenge of high carbon emissions and traffic
   congestion. Ride-sharing services, as a novel green mode of
   transportation, have emerged as a key technology in smart transportation
   for addressing these problems. The implementation of ride-sharing is
   predicated on an accurate ridership demand forecasting model, which can
   effectively prevent vehicle resource waste, alleviate traffic
   congestion, and reduce carbon emissions. In this paper, a periodic
   attentional graph convolutional spatio-temporal network model (PAG-TSN)
   is proposed to predict regional ridership demand. Specifically, the
   model is trained using a large amount of GPS data and user demand data
   collected by the travel service provider. PAG-TSN consists of two parts:
   the bicomponent attention graph convolution model (BAT-GCN) and the
   periodic attentional gated recurrent unit model (PA-GRU). The former
   uses GCN to extract spatial features from pointwise and edgewise graphs;
   the latter uses the spatial feature vectors extracted from the former
   with external information as input, and uses GRU to extract temporal
   features from feature data of different periods, and finally uses
   attention mechanism and POI requirement correlation to integrate the
   extracted spatio-temporal information to derive prediction results.
   Extensive experiments and evaluations on the CD2Date and XA2Date
   datasets show that PAG-TSN outperforms other baseline models in
   accurately predicting regional ridership demand, with MAPE and RMSE
   values of 0.1147 and 5.56, respectively.

AB It has been an important task for recommender systems to suggest
   satisfying activities to a group of users in people's daily social life.
   The major challenge in this task is how to aggregate personal
   preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group.
   Conventional group recommendation methods applied a predefined strategy
   for preference aggregation. However, these static strategies are too
   simple to model the real and complex process of group decision-making,
   especially for occasional groups which are formed ad-hoc. Moreover,
   group members should have non-uniform influences or weights in a group,
   and the weight of a user can be varied in different groups. Therefore,
   an ideal group recommender system should be able to accurately learn not
   only users' personal preferences but also the preference aggregation
   strategy from data. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end group
   recommender system named CAGR (short for "Centrality-Aware Group
   Recommender"), which takes Bipartite Graph Embedding Model (BGEM), the
   self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as
   basic building blocks to learn group and user representations in a
   unified way. Specifically, we first extend BGEM to model group-item
   interactions, and then in order to overcome the limitation and sparsity
   of the interaction data generated by occasional groups, we propose a
   self-attentive mechanism to represent groups based on the group members.
   In addition, to overcome the sparsity issue of user-item interaction
   data, we leverage the user social networks to enhance user
   representation learning, obtaining centrality-aware user
   representations. To further alleviate the group data sparsity problem,
   we propose two model optimization approaches to seamlessly integrate the
   user representations learning process. We create three large-scale
   benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The
   experimental results show the superiority of our proposed CAGR by
   comparing it with state-of-the-art group recommender models.

AB The intermolecular interactions between proteins and ligands occur
   through site-specific amino acid residues in the proteins, and the
   identification of these key residues plays a critical role in both
   interpreting protein function and facilitating drug design based on
   virtual screening. In general, the information about the ligands-binding
   residues on proteins is unknown, and the detection of the binding
   residues by the biological wet experiments is time consuming. Therefore,
   many computational methods have been developed to identify the
   protein-ligand binding residues in recent years. We propose GraphPLBR, a
   framework based on Graph Convolutional Neural (GCN) networks, to predict
   protein-ligand binding residues (PLBR). The proteins are represented as
   a graph with residues as nodes through 3D protein structure data, such
   that the PLBR prediction task is transformed into a graph node
   classification task. A deep graph convolutional network is applied to
   extract information from higher-order neighbors, and initial residue
   connection with identity mapping is applied to cope with the
   over-smoothing problem caused by increasing the number of graph
   convolutional layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is a more
   unique and innovative perspective that utilizes the idea of graph node
   classification for protein-ligand binding residues prediction. By
   comparing with some state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better
   on several metrics.

AB Football (soccer) stands as the world's most popular sport, enthralling
   millions of fans globally. Within the dynamic sphere of modern football,
   gaining comprehensive insights into the nuanced technical and physical
   demands placed on players is pivotal for performance optimization. This
   paper introduces an innovative deep learning-powered image
   classification algorithm for recognizing football player activities
   directly from videos and images. Our pioneering approach harnesses the
   synergistic capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
   graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to decipher intricate
   spatial-temporal patterns in player poses and motions. The methodology
   employs a hybrid CNN and GCN architecture. The CNN leverages consecutive
   convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract discriminative
   visual features from input frames capturing player poses. The GCN
   models' skeletal joints as graph nodes with bones as edges, performing
   graph convolutions to aggregate spatial and temporal information from
   neighboring body parts. This enables capturing localized pose dynamics.
   The complementary CNN and GCN outputs are fused through fully connected
   layers to classify player activities based on both visual appearances
   and pose configurations. The model is trained end to end on richly
   annotated football video data using a multi-class cross-entropy loss.
   Data augmentation and regularization techniques enhance robustness.
   Extensive experiments validate the proposed architecture's
   effectiveness, achieving 97.4% accuracy, 96% precision, 95.5% recall,
   95.4% F1-score, 0.90 Matthews correlation, and 93% specificity in
   classifying 17 complex football activities significantly higher than
   previous benchmarks. Detailed ablation studies confirm the contributions
   of the CNN, GCN, and fused model components. The work represents a major
   advance in leveraging deep neural networks for accurate and granular
   analysis of sports performances.

AB With the development of deep learning, fatigue detection technology for
   drivers has achieved remarkable achievements. Although the image-based
   approach achieves good accuracy, it inevitably leads to greater model
   complexity, which is unsuitable for mobile terminal devices. Luckily,
   human skeletal data significantly reduces the impact of noise and input
   data volume while retaining valid information, and it can better deal
   with real-world driving scenarios with the benefit of robustness in
   complex driving situations. This paper proposes a lightweight
   multi-scale spatio-temporal attention graph convolutional network
   (MS-STAGCN) to efficiently utilize skeleton data to identify driver
   states by aggregating locally and globally valid face information, which
   achieves good performance even for lightweight design. The experimental
   results show that the method achieves 92.4% accuracy on the NTHU-DDD
   dataset, which can be applied to fatigue detection tasks of the driver
   in real-world driving scenarios in the future.

AB This article focuses on the task of detecting human-object interactions

   humans and predicting human-object interaction classes. Two frame-works
   are proposed which detect human-object interactions in videos by
   modeling the trajectory of objects and human skeleton. The first
   framework (knowledge-based spatial-temporal HOI) treats the entire scene
   to be a HOI graph made up of the human skeleton and objects. It has
   fewer parameters and a higher possibility for knowledge embedding. The
   second framework (hierarchical spatial-temporal HOI) constructs a HOI
   graph after obtaining the feature of the human skeleton and objects. It
   outperforms the competition in terms of performance and generalization.
   Experimental results in CAD-120 dataset and SYSU-HOI dataset show that
   the proposed frameworks are more advanced than the state-of-the-art
   methods, with smaller parameters and shorter inference time. Such
   results confirm that the proposed frameworks effectively reduce
   parameters and inference time while maintaining detection accuracy in
   HOI videos.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to the widespread applications in real-world scenarios, metro
   ridership prediction is a crucial but challenging task in intelligent
   transportation systems. However, conventional methods either ignore the
   topological information of metro systems or directly learn on physical
   topology, and cannot fully explore the patterns of ridership evolution.
   To address this problem, we model a metro system as graphs with various
   topologies and propose a unified Physical-Virtual Collaboration Graph
   Network (PVCGN), which can effectively learn the complex ridership
   patterns from the tailor-designed graphs. Specifically, a physical graph
   is directly built based on the realistic topology of the studied metro
   system, while a similarity graph and a correlation graph are built with
   virtual topologies under the guidance of the inter-station passenger
   flow similarity and correlation. These complementary graphs are
   incorporated into a Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (GC-GRU) for
   spatial-temporal representation learning. Further, a Fully-Connected
   Gated Recurrent Unit (FC-GRU) is also applied to capture the global
   evolution tendency. Finally, we develop a Seq2Seq model with GC-GRU and
   FC-GRU to forecast the future metro ridership sequentially. Extensive
   experiments on two large-scale benchmarks (e.g., Shanghai Metro and
   Hangzhou Metro) well demonstrate the superiority of our PVCGN for
   station-level metro ridership prediction. Moreover, we apply the
   proposed PVCGN to address the online origin-destination (OD) ridership
   prediction and the experiment results show the universality of our

AB State-of-the-art 2D image compression schemes rely on the power of
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although CNNs offer promising
   perspectives for 2D image compression, extending such models to
   omnidirectional images is not straightforward. First, omnidirectional
   images have specific spatial and statistical properties that can not be
   fully captured by current CNN models. Second, basic mathematical
   operations composing a CNN architecture, e.g., translation and sampling,
   are not well-defined on the sphere. In this paper, we study the learning
   of representation models for omnidirectional images and propose to use
   the properties of HEALPix uniform sampling of the sphere to redefine the
   mathematical tools used in deep learning models for omnidirectional
   images. In particular, we: i) propose the definition of a new
   convolution operation on the sphere that keeps the high expressiveness
   and the low complexity of a classical 2D convolution; ii) adapt standard
   CNN techniques such as stride, iterative aggregation, and pixel
   shuffling to the spherical domain; and then iii) apply our new framework
   to the task of omnidirectional image compression. Our experiments show
   that our proposed on-the-sphere solution leads to a better compression
   gain that can save 13.7% of the bit rate compared to similar learned
   models applied to equirectangular images. Also, compared to learning
   models based on graph convolutional networks, our solution supports more
   expressive filters that can preserve high frequencies and provide a
   better perceptual quality of the compressed images. Such results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework, which opens new
   research venues for other omnidirectional vision tasks to be effectively
   implemented on the sphere manifold.

AB Inspections on current graph neural networks suggest us to reconsider
   the computational aspect of the final aggregation. We consider that such
   aggregations perform a prediction smoothing and impute their potential
   drawbacks to be the inter-class interference implied by the underlying
   graphs. We aim at weak-ening the inter-class connections so that
   aggregations focus more on intra-class relations and producing smooth
   predictions according to weakening results. We apply a metric learning
   module to learn new edge weights and combine entropy losses to ensure
   the correspondence between the predictions and the learnt distances so
   that the weights of inter-class edges are reduced and predictions are
   smoothed ac-cording to the modified graph. Experiments on four citation
   networks and a Wiki network show that in comparison with other
   state-of-the-art graph neural networks, the proposed algorithm can
   improve the classification accuracy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The location recommendation of an air-quality-monitoring station is a
   prerequisite for inferring the air-quality distribution in urban areas.
   How to use a limited number of monitoring equipment to accurately infer
   air quality depends on the location of the monitoring equipment. In this
   paper, our main objective was how to recommend optimal
   monitoring-station locations based on existing ones to maximize the
   accuracy of a air-quality inference model for inferring the air-quality
   distribution of an entire urban area. This task is challenging for the
   following main reasons: (1) air-quality distribution has spatiotemporal
   interactions and is affected by many complex external influential
   factors, such as weather and points of interest (POIs), and (2) how to
   effectively correlate the air-quality inference model with the
   monitoring station location recommendation model so that the recommended
   station can maximize the accuracy of the air-quality inference model. To
   solve the aforementioned challenges, we formulate the monitoring station
   location as an urban spatiotemporal graph (USTG) node recommendation
   problem in which each node represents a region with time-varying
   air-quality values. We design an effective air-quality inference
   model-based proposed high-order graph convolution (HGCNInf) that could
   capture the spatiotemporal interaction of air-quality distribution and
   could extract external influential factor features. Furthermore, HGCNInf
   can learn the correlation degree between the nodes in USTG that reflects
   the spatiotemporal changes in air quality. Based on the correlation
   degree, we design a greedy algorithm for minimizing information entropy
   (GMIE) that aims to mark the recommendation priority of unlabeled nodes
   according to the ability to improve the inference accuracy of HGCNInf
   through the node incremental learning method. Finally, we recommend the
   node with the highest priority as the new monitoring station location,
   which could bring about the greatest accuracy improvement to HGCNInf.

AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising method for gaining
   perception and common sense from unlabelled data. Existing approaches to
   analyzing human body skeletons address the problem similar to SSL models
   for image and video understanding, but pixel data is far more
   challenging than coordinates. This paper presents ATOM, an SSL model
   designed for skeleton-based data analysis. Unlike video-based SSL
   approaches, ATOM leverages atomic movements within skeleton actions to
   achieve a more fine-grained representation. The pro-posed architecture
   predicts the action order at the frame level, leading to improved
   perceptions and represen-tations of each action. ATOM outperforms
   state-of-the-art approaches in two well-known datasets (NTU RGB + D and
   NTU-120 RGB + D), and its weight transferability enables performance
   improvements on supervised and semi-supervised tasks, up to 4.4% (3.3%
   p.p.) and 14.1% (6.3% p.p.), respectively, in Top-1 Accuracy.

AB Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors are flexible and non-invasive
   sensoring devices for the measurement of electrical brain activity which
   is extensively used in some areas of clinical practice and
   psychological/psychiatric research, such as epilepsy, sleep, emotion,
   and brain computer interfaces. Although EEG sensor do not provide actual
   brain localizations of the activity sources, they allow to study brain
   functional connectivity. In this paper we review current application of
   a specific family of computational methods, the Graph Neural Networks
   (GNN) to the analysis of EEG data. GNNs appear to be well suited to EEG
   data modeling as they deal with signals whose domain is defined by a
   graph instead of a regular lattice in Euclidean space. Readings of EEG
   electrodes fall in this category, hence the increasing research activity
   on the application of GNNs to EEG data.

AB Greedy routing efficiently achieves routing solutions for vehicular
   networks due to its simplicity and reliability. However, the existing
   greedy routing algorithms have mainly considered simple routing metrics
   only, e.g., distance based on the local view of an individual vehicle.
   This consideration is insufficient for analysing dynamic and complicated
   vehicular communication scenarios which inevitably degrades the overall
   routing performance. Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) and Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) can overcome these limitations. Thus, this
   paper presents a novel GCN-based greedy routing algorithm (NGGRA) in the
   hybrid SDVN. The SDVN control plane trains the GCN decision model based
   on the globally collected data. Vehicles with transmission requirements
   can adopt this model for inferring and making the routing decisions. The
   proposed node-importance-based graph convolutional network (NiGCN) model
   analyses multiple correlated metrics to accurately evaluate the dynamic
   vehicular network is available at: https://github.com/a824899245/NiGCN.
   Meanwhile, the SDVN architecture offers a global view for model training
   and routing computation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that
   NiGCN outperforms popular GCN models in training efficiency and
   accuracy. In addition, NGGRA can improve the packet delivery ratio and
   substantially reduce delay compared with its counterparts.

AB Transformer has achieved outstanding performance in many fields such as
   computer vision benefiting from its powerful and efficient modelling
   ability and long-range feature extraction capability complementary to
   convolution. However, on the one hand, the lack of CNN's innate
   inductive biases, such as translation invariance and local sensitivity,
   makes Transformer require more data for learning. On the other hand,
   labelled hyperspectral samples are scarce due to the time-consuming and
   costly annotation task. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised
   hierarchical Transformer model for HSI classification to improve the
   classification performance of the Transformer with limited labelled
   samples. In order to perturb the samples more fully and extensively to
   improve the model performance, two different data augmentation methods
   are used to perturb the unlabelled samples, and two sets of augmented
   samples are obtained respectively. The pseudo-label obtained on the
   original unlabelled sample is used to simultaneously supervise the
   augmented sample obtained on this unlabelled sample. Among them, only
   the pseudo-labels above the threshold are retained. To further improve
   the model stability and classification accuracy, hierarchical patch
   embedding is proposed to eliminate the mutual interference between
   pixels. Extensive experiments on three well-known hyperspectral datasets
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised Transformer
   model. The experiments show that the model achieves excellent
   classification accuracy even when there are only 10 labelled samples in
   each category, which can effectively improve the classification
   performance of Transformer under small-scale labelled samples.

AB Introduction: In the field of power systems, power load type prediction
   is a crucial task. Different types of loads, such as domestic,
   industrial, commercial, etc., have different energy consumption
   patterns. Therefore, accurate prediction of load types can help the
   power system better plan power supply strategies to improve energy
   utilization and stability. However, this task faces multiple challenges,
   including the complex topology of the power system, the diversity of
   time series data, and the correlation between data. With the rapid
   development of deep learning methods, researchers are beginning to
   leverage these powerful techniques to address this challenge. This study
   aims to explore how to optimize deep learning models to improve the
   accuracy of load type prediction and provide support for efficient
   energy management and optimization of smart grids.Methods: In this
   study, we propose a deep learning method that combines graph
   convolutional networks (GCN) and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models
   and introduces an attention mechanism. The methodology involves multiple
   steps: first, we use the GCN encoder to process the topological
   structure information of the power system and encode node features into
   a graph data representation. Next, the Seq2Seq decoder takes the
   historical time series data as the input sequence and generates a
   prediction sequence of the load type. We then introduced an attention
   mechanism, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its attention to
   input data and better capture the relationship between time series data
   and graph data.Results: We conducted extensive experimental validation
   on four different datasets, including the National Grid Electricity Load
   Dataset, the Canadian Electricity Load Dataset, the United States
   Electricity Load Dataset, and the International Electricity Load
   Dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant
   improvements in load type prediction tasks. It exhibits higher accuracy
   and robustness compared to traditional methods and single deep learning
   models. Our approach demonstrates advantages in improving load type
   prediction accuracy, providing strong support for the future development
   of the power system.Discussion: The results of our study highlight the
   potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the combination of
   GCN and Seq2Seq models with attention mechanisms, in addressing the
   challenges of load type prediction in power systems. By improving
   prediction accuracy and robustness, our approach can contribute to more
   efficient energy management and the optimization of smart grids.

AB Maximum utilization of the full solar spectrum has been considered as a
   holy grail in the field of photocatalysis and has emerged important in
   the recent years, as the world needs to move towards renewable energy
   sources and also to maintain environmental health. In the search for a
   sustainable solution, we have come up with a strategic combination of
   materials, which can be active under all the three regions, namely
   ultraviolet (UV), visible and near infrared (NIR) of the sunlight.
   Specifically, we have developed a series of nanocomposites comprising of
   two dimensional nanosheets of zinc oxide (ZnO) and graphitic carbon
   nitride (GCN), and successfully coupled them with upconversion
   nanoparticles (UCNP). These nanocomposites have been successfully
   utilized for the photocatalytic chromium (Cr(VI)) reduction. The
   prepared nanocomposites exhibit an excellent photocatalytic activity
   toward reduction of Cr(VI) under different light region. A plausible
   mechanism for the photocatalytic process has been proposed based on the
   detailed study. This work is expected to pave way for the strategic
   design and development of many photocatalytic systems, which can utilize
   sunlight to the maximum extent. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Hyperspectral image classification plays a crucial role in various
   remote sensing applications. However, existing methods often struggle
   with the challenge of unknown classes, leading to decreased
   classification accuracy and limited generalization. In this paper, we
   propose a novel deep learning framework called IADMRN, which addresses
   the issue of unknown class handling in hyperspectral image
   classification. IADMRN combines the strengths of dense connection blocks
   and attention mechanisms to extract discriminative features from
   hyperspectral data. Furthermore, it employs a multi-scale deconvolution
   image reconstruction sub-network to enhance feature reconstruction and
   provide additional information for classification. To handle unknown
   classes, IADMRN utilizes an extreme value theory-based model to
   calculate the probability of unknown class membership. Experimental
   results on the three public datasets demonstrate that IADMRN outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy for both
   known and unknown classes. Experimental results show that the proposed
   methods outperform several state-of-the-art methods, which outperformed
   DCFSL by 8.47%, 6.57%, and 4.25%, and outperformed MDL4OW by 4.35%,
   4.08%, and 2.47% on the Salinas, University of Pavia, and Indian Pines
   datasets, respectively. The proposed framework is computationally
   efficient and showcases the ability to effectively handle unknown
   classes in hyperspectral image classification tasks. Overall, IADMRN
   offers a promising solution for accurate and robust hyperspectral image
   classification, making it a valuable tool for remote sensing
   applications.

AB Structural damage detection plays an important part in structural health
   monitoring for engineering structures. However, monitored signals are
   easily polluted by noise and the damaged data are difficult to obtain.
   In this work, a novel structural damage detection approach using
   multisensor spatial-temporal graph-based features and deep graph
   convolutional networks (DGCNs) is presented. The spatial-temporal graph
   is constructed by the graph theory based on continuous wavelet transform
   (CWT) of vibration signals. Then, the multisensor spatial-temporal
   graph-based feature is extracted based on the Laplacian matrix derived
   from the spatial-temporal graph of the multisensor data. To overcome the
   limitation of small data size which obstructed the use of the artificial
   neural network and convolutional neural network, a DGCN is utilized to
   classify the damage type of the monitored structure. The extracted
   multisensor spatial-temporal graph-based feature vector is used to
   represent the node of the global graph as the input of the DGCN. The
   node with the same condition of the structure can be classified by using
   the well-trained DGCN. Experiments of the International Association for
   Structural Control (IASC)-American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) SHM
   benchmark structure and Qatar steel frame structure in the laboratory
   are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   experimental results show that the DGCN method can be used to detect
   structural damage by learning from the constructed global graphs.
   Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach performs
   better than the conventional approach, especially for the limited
   dataset and noise-polluted case.

AB Brain disease propagation is associated with characteristic alterations
   in the structural and functional connectivity networks of the brain. To
   identify disease-specific network representations, graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) have been used because of their powerful graph embedding
   ability to characterize the non-Euclidean structure of brain networks.
   However, existing GCNs generally focus on learning the discriminative
   region of interest (ROI) features, often ignoring important topological
   information that enables the integration of connectome patterns of brain
   activity. In addition, most methods fail to consider the vulnerability
   of GCNs to perturbations in network properties of the brain, which
   considerably degrades the reliability of diagnosis results. In this
   study, we propose an adversarially trained persistent homology-based
   graph convolutional network (ATPGCN) to capture disease-specific brain
   connectome patterns and classify brain diseases. First, the brain
   functional/structural connectivity is constructed using different
   neuroimaging modalities. Then, we develop a novel strategy that
   concatenates the persistent homology features from a brain algebraic
   topology analysis with readout features of the global pooling layer of a
   GCN model to collaboratively learn the individual-level representation.
   Finally, we simulate the adversarial perturbations by targeting the risk
   ROIs from clinical prior, and incorporate them into a training loop to
   evaluate the robustness of the model. The experimental results on three
   independent datasets demonstrate that ATPGCN outperforms existing
   classification methods in disease identification and is robust to minor
   perturbations in network architecture. Our code is available at
   https://github.com/CYB08/ATPGCN.

AB Water pollution has serious consequences for human health and water
   ecosystems, and accurate forecasting of water quality changes can aid in
   the early detection and treatment of such pollution. To better simulate
   the characteristics of water quality data, the development of a water
   quality prediction model must consider the non-smoothness of the data as
   well as the relationship between upstream and downstream water quality.
   Firstly, Optimal Variational Mode Decomposition (OVMD) technology is
   used to pre-process water quality monitoring data through linear
   decomposition into multiple components, with the components acting as a
   unit of prediction to reduce the difficulty of prediction. Secondly, to
   reflect the impact of upstream and downstream water quality
   relationships, comprehensive prediction modeling is carried out on the
   temporal and spatial correlation of water quality data between
   monitoring stations. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are embedded in the
   Gated Recurrent Unit's (GRU) reset gate and update gate, and adaptive
   aggregation of data spatial characteristics of each site based on each
   station is used to achieve a multi-step prediction of water quality
   indicators. Finally, the predicted values of each component are then
   fused to form the final predicted values. Validation at 13 monitoring
   stations along the Mulan River demonstrated the effectiveness of the
   integrated prediction model.The results showed that, under different
   prediction steps, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute
   Error (MAE) values of the GAT-GRU water quality prediction model were
   reduced by about 11-20% (ammonia nitrogen, NH3-N) and 8-18% (total
   phosphorus, TP) compared with the GCN (Graph Convolutional
   Networks)-GRU, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) value
   was increased by about 20% (NH3-N) and 13% (TP), respectively. The RMSE
   and MAE values of the OVMD-GAT-GRU water quality prediction model were
   further reduced by about 52-57% (NH3-N) and 25-35% (TP) compared with
   GAT-GRU, and the NSE value was increased by about 19-43% (NH3-N) and
   15-33% (TP), respectively. As the prediction steps increased, the
   advantages of OVMD-GAT-GRU over GAT-GRU and GCN-GRU became more
   pronounced. These results demonstrate that OVMD-GAT-GRU exhibits
   superior prediction performance, robustness, accuracy, and adaptability
   to water quality indicators. The development of the OVMD-GAT-GRU water
   quality prediction model can provide significant assistance in the
   prevention and management of water pollution.

AB Group activity recognition is a significant and challenging task in
   computer vision. The solution of group activity prediction can be
   classified with traditional hand-crafted features, RGB video features,
   and skeleton data-based deep learning architectures, such as Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and
   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs). However, they rarely explore pose
   information and rarely use relational networks to reason about group
   activity behavior. In this work, we leverage minimal prior knowledge
   about the skeleton information to reason about the interactions from
   group activity. The objective is to obtain discriminative
   representations and filter out some ambiguous actions to enhance the
   performance of group activity recognition. Our contribution is a
   proposed Attention Relation Network (ARN) that fuses the attention
   mechanisms and joint vector sequences into the relation network. The
   skeleton joints vector sequences are previously unexplored pose
   information and assign greater significance attributed to individuals
   who are more relevant for distinguishing the group activity behavior.
   First, our model focuses on the specified edge-level information
   (encompassing both edge and edge motion data) within the skeleton
   dataset, considering directionality, to analyze the spatiotemporal
   aspects of the action. Second, recognizing the inherent motion
   directionality, we establish diverse directions for skeleton edges and
   extract distinct motion features (including translation and rotation
   information) aligned with these various orientations, thereby augmenting
   the utilization of motion attributes related to the action. We also
   introduce a representation of human motion achieved by combining
   relational networks and examining their integrated characteristics.
   Extensive experiments were tested in the Hockey and UT-interaction
   datasets to evaluate our method, obtaining competitive performance to
   the state-of-the-art. Results demonstrate the modeling potential of a
   skeleton-based method for group activity recognition.

AB In fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, the main challenges include the lack
   of prior research and the urgency to find effective solutions. It is
   essential to accurately and rapidly summarize the relevant research work
   and explore potential solutions for diagnosis, treatment and prevention
   of COVID-19. It is a daunting task to summarize the numerous existing
   research works and to assess their effectiveness. This paper explores
   the discovery of new COVID-19 research approaches based on dynamic link
   prediction, which analyze the dynamic topological network of keywords to
   predict possible connections of research concepts. A dynamic link
   prediction method based on multi-granularity feature fusion is proposed.
   Firstly, a multi-granularity temporal feature fusion method is adopted
   to extract the temporal evolution of different order subgraphs.
   Secondly, a hierarchical feature weighting method is proposed to
   emphasize actively evolving nodes. Thirdly, a semantic repetition
   sampling mechanism is designed to avoid the negative effect of
   semantically equivalent medical entities on the real structure of the
   graph, and to capture the real topological structure features.
   Experiments are performed on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset to
   assess the performance of the model. The results show that the proposed
   model performs significantly better than existing state-of-the-art
   models, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method for
   the discovery of new COVID-19 research approaches.

AB In this study, a framework for the prediction of thermophysical
   properties based on transfer learning from existing estimation models is
   explored. The predictive capabilities of conventional group-contribution
   methods and traditional machinelearning approaches rely heavily on the
   availability of experimental datasets and their uncertainty. Through the
   use of a pretraining scheme, which leverages the knowledge established
   by other estimation methods, improved prediction models for
   thermophysical properties can be obtained after fine-tuning networks
   with more accurate experimental data. As our experiments show, for the
   case of critical properties of compounds, this pipeline not only
   improves the performance of the models on commonly found organic
   structures but can also help these models generalize to less explored
   areas of chemical space, where experimental data is scarce, such as
   inorganics and heavier organic compounds. Transfer learning from
   estimation models data also allows for graph-based deep learning models
   to create more flexible molecular features over a bigger chemical space,
   which leads to improved predictive capabilities and can give insights
   into the relationship between molecular structures and thermophysical
   properties. The generated molecular features can discriminate behavior
   discrepancy between isomers without the need of additional parameters.
   Also, this approach shows better robustness to outliers in experimental
   datasets.

AB Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has recently become a promising data
   acquisition paradigm, which recruits a large number of users to collect
   data from the target sensing areas. Obviously, with the increase of
   sensing scale and the decrease of sensing granularity, traditional MCS
   cannot fully cover the required sensing areas especially the
   inaccessible areas. As a variant, Sparse MCS can utilize the
   spatiotemporal correlations in sensing data to infer the whole sensing
   map only by sensing a few subareas. However, in many real-world
   scenarios, such as traffic congestion prediction or parking occupancy
   detection, inferring the current unsensed data may not be the final
   goal. By comparison, it is more important to get the future information
   through the sparse sensed data. In this paper, we turn attention from
   inferring the current unsensed data to predicting the future unknown
   data and propose an urban inference and prediction framework in Sparse
   MCS. To deal with the sparse sensed data, we first present a
   bipartite-graph-based matrix completion algorithm with spatiotemporal
   constraints to accurately recover the current full map. Then, by
   exploiting spatiotemporal correlations based on the inferred full map,
   we present a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with spatiotemporal
   attention to predict the future maps. Furthermore, we design a
   spatiotemporal iterative method to repeatedly update the spatiotemporal
   attentions and constraints, in order to connect the urban inference and
   prediction to improve the accuracy of the whole framework. Extensive
   experiments have been conducted on two types of typical urban sensing
   tasks with four real-world data sets, which verify the effectiveness of
   our proposed algorithms in improving the inference and prediction
   accuracy with the sparse sensed data.

AB Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) refers to finding images from an
   image database that contain the same instance as the query image, which
   is an essential task in remote sensing applications. Traditional
   depth-based hashing algorithms usually convert the image library into a
   hash matrix with a specified number of digits. On the one hand, the
   quality of hash matrices generated by traditional methods is low and
   cannot guarantee good clustering between pictures of the same class. On
   the other hand, the ability to extract features using backbone networks
   must be improved. This paper proposes a deep hashing model called
   adaptive hash code balancing (AHCB) to solve two existing problems. The
   model introduces a balanced binary method to maximize the hash value
   entropy so that the generated hash has better clustering. Graph
   convolutional networks(GCNs) are introduced to automatically detect
   relevant data points in the graph, perform back-propagation, and
   propagate the updated network feedback to the feature extraction layer
   to improve the ability to extract features. It enables the model to
   learn the intrinsic data structure between remote sensing images.
   Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed
   method outperforms the current state-of-the-art deep hashing remote
   sensing image retrieval algorithms by a large margin.

AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a wealth of prior knowledge for the
   research on social networks. Cross-lingual entity alignment aims at
   integrating complementary KGs from different languages and thus benefits
   various knowledge-driven social network studies. Recent entity alignment
   methods often take an embedding-based approach to model the entity and
   relation embedding of KGs. However, these studies mostly focus on the
   information of the entity itself and its structural features but ignore
   the influence of multiple types of data in KGs. In this paper, we
   propose a new embedding-based framework named multiview highway graph
   convolutional network (MHGCN), which considers the entity alignment from
   the views of entity semantic, relation semantic, and entity attribute.
   To learn the structural features of an entity, the MHGCN employs a
   highway graph convolutional network (GCN) for entity embedding in each
   view. In addition, the MHGCN weights and fuses the multiple views
   according to the importance of the embedding from each view to obtain a
   better entity embedding. The alignment entities are identified based on
   the similarity of entity embeddings. The experimental results show that
   the MHGCN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art alignment
   methods. The research also will benefit knowledge fusion through
   cross-lingual KG entity alignment.

AB Catalytic properties of noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs) are largely
   determined by their surface morphology. The latter is probed by
   surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques in different spectra regions.
   A fast and precise computational approach enabling the prediction of
   surface-adsorbate interaction would help the reliable description and
   interpretation of experimental data. In this work, we applied Machine
   Learning (ML) algorithms for the task of adsorption-energy approximation
   for CO on Pd nanoclusters. Due to a high dependency of binding energy
   from the nature of the adsorbing site and its local coordination, we
   tested several structural descriptors for the ML algorithm, including
   mean Pd-C distances, coordination numbers (CN) and generalized
   coordination numbers (GCN), radial distribution functions (RDF), and
   angular distribution functions (ADF). To avoid overtraining and to probe
   the most relevant positions above the metal surface, we utilized the
   adaptive sampling methodology for guiding the ab initio Density
   Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The support vector machines (SVM)
   and Extra Trees algorithms provided the best approximation quality and
   mean absolute error in energy prediction up to 0.12 eV. Based on the
   developed potential, we constructed an energy-surface 3D map for the
   whole Pd-55 nanocluster and extended it to new geometries, Pd-79, and
   Pd-85, not implemented in the training sample. The methodology can be
   easily extended to adsorption energies onto mono- and bimetallic NPs at
   an affordable computational cost and accuracy.

AB The use of dyes and segments has increased widely in recent years, but
   it poses a serious health risk to eco-systems. In this work, TiO2 and
   two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets (g-CN) were fabricated through co
   -precipitation and thermal polymerization technique, respectively. The
   g-CN-TiO2 photocatalyst (1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1) in various weight percentages
   was prepared using a simple impregnation process. The photocatalytic
   behaviour of the g-CN, TiO2 NPs, and different weight percentages of
   g-CN-TiO2 photocatalyst was evaluated against methylene blue (MB) dye
   under UV-visible light illumination. Compared to pristine and other
   weight percentages of the g-CN-TiO2 nanocomposite, the optimized
   g-CN-TiO2 nanocomposite (3:1) showed promoted performance against MB
   dye. The enriched catalytic efficiency can be accredited to the low
   amount of TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on gCN nanosheets, possibly due
   to the boosted transport properties of the electron-hole pairs. The
   enriched photocatalytic behaviour can be attributed to the development
   of the Z-scheme system be-tween TiO2 and g-CN. The current study is an
   outstanding demonstration of the development of maximum catalytic
   efficiency for destroying hazardous chemical dyes.

   dual complementary phases allow localized photon absorption of different

   are absent in widely used graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and amorphous
   carbon nitride (ACN) photocatalysts, are highly desirable for precious
   metal (i.e. Pt) cocatalyst-free hydrogen production via water-splitting.

AB Chemically fixing CO2 into the fine chemicals is a sustainable route to
   the utilization of CO2 and meets the requirements of green chemistry.
   Generally, an important intermediate, high-valued cyclic carbonates, is
   produced by catalyzed cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides during the CO2
   fixation. However, most of the catalysts for cycloaddition can hardly
   meet the standards of the green chemistry, including highly efficient,
   low cost, easily recoverable and recyclable etc. Therefore, in this
   work, an environmentally friendly composite Zn-CN/C catalyst for the
   cycloaddition of styrene oxide and CO2 was successfully prepared by a
   facile method. To this end, zinc bromide was immobilized by graphitic
   carbon nitride (gCN) and then supported on carbon fibers. Meanwhile, the
   crystal structure, types of chemical bonding, surface morphologies, and
   electronic transmission of the prepared catalyst were also investigated.
   Furthermore, the catalytic performance was evaluated by the
   cycloaddition reactions of styrene oxide and CO2, a satisfactory result
   of the moderate yield of 50-90% with a good selectivity (> 99%) was
   obtained. Finally, a credible mechanism of the reaction was proposed.

AB Stocks that are fundamentally connected with each other tend to move
   together. Considering such common trends is believed to benefit stock
   movement forecasting tasks. However, such signals are not trivial to
   model because the connections among stocks are not physically presented
   and need to be estimated from volatile data. Motivated by this
   observation, we propose a framework that incorporates the
   inter-connection of firms to forecast stock prices. To effectively
   utilize a large set of fundamental features, we further design a novel
   pipeline. First, we use variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the
   dimension of stock fundamental information and then cluster stocks into
   a graph structure (fundamentally clustering). Second, a hybrid model of
   graph convolutional network and long-short term memory network
   (GCN-LSTM) with an adjacency graph matrix (learnt from VAE) is proposed
   for graph-structured stock market forecasting. Experiments on
   minute-level U.S. stock market data demonstrate that our model
   effectively captures both spatial and temporal signals and achieves
   superior improvement over baseline methods. The proposed model is
   promising for other applications in which there is a possible but hidden
   spatial dependency to improve time-series prediction.

AB Background: Event extraction is essential for natural language
   processing. In the biomedical field, the nested event phenomenon (event
   A as a participating role of event B) makes extracting this event more
   difficult than extracting a single event. Therefore, the performance of
   nested biomedical events is always underwhelming. In addition, previous
   works relied on a pipeline to build an event extraction model, which
   ignored the dependence between trigger recognition and event argument
   detection tasks and produced significant cascading errors.
   Objective: This study aims to design a unified framework to jointly
   train biomedical event triggers and arguments and improve the
   performance of extracting nested biomedical events.
   Methods: We proposed an end-to-end joint extraction model that considers
   the probability distribution of triggers to alleviate cascading errors.
   Moreover, we integrated the syntactic structure into an attention-based
   gate graph convolutional network to capture potential interrelations
   between triggers and related entities, which improved the performance of
   extracting nested biomedical events.
   Results: The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method
   achieved the best F1 score on the multilevel event extraction biomedical
   event extraction corpus and achieved a favorable performance on the
   biomedical natural language processing shared task 2011 Genia event
   corpus.
   Conclusions: Our conditional probability joint extraction model is good
   at extracting nested biomedical events because of the joint extraction
   mechanism and the syntax graph structure. Moreover, as our model did not
   rely on external knowledge and specific feature engineering, it had a
   particular generalization performance.

AB Spatial-temporal event prediction is a particular task for multivariate
   time series forecasting. Therefore, the complex entangled dynamics of
   space and time need to be considered. This task is an essential but
   crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely
   applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility
   analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial-temporal modelling has
   been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the
   video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise
   correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To
   overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework,
   Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial-temporal
   event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph
   convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not
   only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise
   dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective
   architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise
   spatial-temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal
   dependencies learning. Experimental results on three urban datasets
   demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.(c) 2021

AB The recently proposed one-to-one label assignment rules have made it
   possible for the detector to get rid of its dependence on NMS. However,
   its performance is inferior to conventional one-to-many label assignment
   trained detector due to insufficient supervision caused by reduced
   foreground information. In this paper, to combine the advantages of
   these two kinds of label assignment rules, we assign two sets of
   positive samples by one-to-many and one-to-one label assignment rules
   respectively to train the detector. Furthermore, we introduce the graph
   convolutional network (GCN) to construct a NMS-aware alignment module.
   The NMS-aware alignment module is devised to bridge the gap between the
   two sets of positive samples and generate a mask to select out best
   detections, which plays the role of NMS. It also gets rid of the
   limitation of processing the grid-like data structure and effectively
   aggregates information from the duplicate predictions. Extensive
   experiments on the COCO dataset show the effectiveness of our method and
   the proposed method achieves competitive performance against the recent
   NMS-free detec-tors. Especially, our proposed method is compatible with
   both anchor-based and anchor-free or one-stage and two-stage
   architectures. The code will be made public soon. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task that
   detects the sentiment polarities of particular aspect words in a
   sentence. With the rise of graph convolution networks (GCNs), current
   ABSA models mostly use graph-based methods. These methods construct a
   dependency tree for each sentence, and regard each word as a unique
   node. To be more specific, they conduct classification using aspect
   representations instead of sentence representations, and update them
   with GCNs. However, this kind of method relies too much on the quality
   of the dependency tree and may lose the global sentence information,
   which is also helpful for classification. To deal with these, we design
   a new ABSA model AG-VSR. Two kinds of representations are proposed to
   perform the final classification, Attention-assisted Graph-based
   Representation (A2GR) and Variational Sentence Representation (VSR).
   A2GR is produced by the GCN module, which inputs a dependency tree
   modified by the attention mechanism. Furthermore, VSR is sampled from a
   distribution learned by a VAE-like encoder-decoder structure. Extensive
   experiments show that our model AG-VSR achieves competitive results. Our
   code and data have been released in

AB Spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasting technology plays an important role in
   urban traffic environment management and planning. In order to establish
   a satisfactory high-precision PM2.5 prediction model, a new
   multidata-driven spatiotemporal PM2.5 forecasting model is proposed in
   this paper. The overall modelling framework consists of three main
   parts. In part I, the graph convolutional network uses an adjacency
   matrix to effectively aggregate spatiotemporal pollutant data from
   different nodes and extract the most valuable feature information for
   target point modeling from the original data. In part II, the extracted
   feature information is used as the input of the gated recursive unit and
   the long short-term memory network to construct the prediction model. In
   part III, the Q-learning algorithm builds the best ensemble PM2.5
   forecasting model by analyzing the processing ability and analysis
   ability of different predictors. Based on the analysis of multiple
   cases, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Graphic convolutional
   networks can effectively analyze the spatiotemporal correlation of PM2.5
   data and achieve better performance than traditional convolutional
   neural networks. (2) Q-learning can adaptively optimize the ensemble
   weight coefficient and achieve better results than the traditional
   optimization algorithm. (3) The proposed GCN-LSTM-GRU-Q model can
   achieve better results than the 24 benchmark models.

AB The recommendation system is an important and widely used technology in
   the era of Big Data. Current methods have fused side information into it
   to alleviate the sparsity problem, one of the key problems of
   recommendation systems. However, not all the side information can be
   obtained with high quality, and the specific methods based on side
   information are not universal. In addition, side information has not
   been mined by the existing graph-based methods. To address these
   problems, we propose a Dynamic evolution of Multi-Graph Collaborative
   Filtering (DMGCF) model to mine and reuse side information.
   Specifically, we first construct user graph and item graph based on
   user-item bipartite graph and embeddings to exploit inter-user and
   inter-item relationships. The two new graphs simulate side information
   in latent space. Next, we perform a dual-path graph convolution network
   (GCN) on these three graphs for collaborative filtering. Then, a novel
   dynamic evolution mechanism is proposed to update and promote the
   embeddings and graphs collaboratively during the learning process, which
   produces better embeddings, user and item relationships, as well as the
   rating scores. We conduct a series of experiments on real-world
   datasets, and experimental results show the effectiveness of our
   approach. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Targeted therapy for one for a set of genes has made it possible to
   apply precision medicine for different patients due to the existence of
   tumor heterogeneity. However, how to regulate those genes are still
   problematic. One of the natural regulators of genes is microRNAs. Thus,
   a better understanding of the miRNA-gene interaction mechanism might
   contribute to future diagnosis, prevention, and cancer therapy. The
   interactions between microRNA and genes play an essential role in
   molecular genetics. The in-vivo experiments validating the relationships
   between them are time-consuming, money-costly, and labor-intensive. With
   the development of high-throughput technology, we dealt with tons of
   biological data. However, extracting features from tremendous raw data
   and making a mathematical model is still a challenging topic. Machine
   learning and deep learning algorithms have become powerful tools in
   dealing with biological data. Inspired by this, in this paper, we
   propose a model that combines features/embedding extraction methods,
   deep learning algorithms, and a voting system. We leverage doc2vec to
   generate sequential embedding from molecular sequences. The role2vec,
   GCN, and GMM for geometrical embedding were generated from the complex
   network from similarity and pair-wise datasets. For the deep learning
   algorithms, we leveraged LSTM and Bi-LSTM according to different
   embedding and features. Finally, we adopted a voting system to balance
   results from different data sources. The results have shown that our
   voting system could achieve a higher AUC than the existing benchmark.
   The case studies demonstrate that our model could reveal potential
   relationships between miRNAs and genes. The source code, features, and
   predictive results can be downloaded at

AB The software engineering community is working to develop reliable
   metrics to improve software quality. It is estimated that understanding
   the source code accounts for 60% of the software maintenance effort.
   Cognitive informatics is important in quantifying the degree of
   difficulty or the efforts made by developers to understand the source
   code. Several empirical studies were conducted in 2003 to assign
   cognitive weights to each possible basic control structure of software,
   and these cognitive weights are used by several researchers to evaluate
   the cognitive complexity of software systems. In this paper, an effort
   has been made to categorize the Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nodes
   according to their node features. In our case, we extracted seven unique
   features from the program, and each unique feature was assigned an
   integer value that we evaluated through Cognitive Complexity Measures
   (CCMs). We then incorporated CCMs' results as a node feature value in
   CFGs and generated the same based on the node connectivity for a graph.
   In order to obtain the feature representation of the graph, a node
   vector matrix is then created for the graph and passed to the Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN). We prepared our data sets using GCN output
   and then built Deep Neural Network Defect Prediction (DNN-DP) and
   Convolutional Neural Network Defect Prediction (CNN-DP) models to
   predict software defects. The Python programming language is used, along
   with Keras and TensorFlow. Three hundred twenty Python programs were
   written by our talented UG and PG students, and all experiments were
   carried out during laboratory classes. Together with three skilled lab
   programmers, they compiled and ran each individual program and detected
   defect/no-defect programs before categorizing them into three different
   classes, namely Simple, Medium, and Complex programs. Accuracy, Receiver
   Operating Characteristics (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), F-measure,
   Precision and hyper-parameter tuning procedures are used to evaluate the
   approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed models
   outperformed state-of-the-art methods such as Nave Bayes (NB), Decision
   Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) in all
   evaluation criteria.

AB Population growth, climate change, and global warming have led
   researchers to be interested in utilizing ecofriendly methods for the
   nitrogen reduction process. It has found that nitrogen molecule can be
   converted into ammonia in ambient conditions using photocatalysts under
   visible light. In the present work, a novel visible light active
   nanocomposite was fabricated, in which different percentages of Ni3V2O8
   nanoparticles (10, 15, 20, and 30%) were decorated on graphitic carbon
   nitride nanosheets (abbreviated as NGCN/NiVO). Then, morphology,
   textural, optical properties, and crystal structure of the
   photocatalysts were studied in detail. The results displayed that the
   NGCN/NiVO (20%) photocatalyst has significant catalytic performance in
   the ammonia generation process in comparison with the NGCN and GCN,
   which is 2.3 and 8 times higher, respectively. The stability of
   NGCN/NiVO (20%) nanocomposite, as a vital parameter, was evaluated for
   five runs. Also, the impact of electron scavengers, solvent, and pH of
   media was examined. Finally, a possible mechanism for the considerable
   enhancement of nitrogen photofixation efficiency was suggested.

AB With an increasing number of biomedical ontologies being evolved
   independently, matching these ontologies to solve the interoperability
   problem has become a critical issue in biomedical applications.
   Traditional biomedical ontology matching methods are mostly based on
   rules or similarities for concepts and properties. These approaches
   require manually designed rules that not only fail to address the
   heterogeneity of domain ontology terminology and the ambiguity of
   multiple meanings of words, but also make it difficult to capture
   structural information in ontologies that contain a large amount of
   semantics during matching. Recently, various knowledge graph (KG)
   embedding techniques utilizing deep learning methods to deal with the
   heterogeneity in knowledge graphs (KGs), have quickly gained massive
   attention. However, KG embedding focuses mainly on entity alignment
   (EA). EA tasks and ontology matching (OM) tasks differ dramatically in
   terms of matching elements, semantic information and application
   scenarios, etc., hence these methods cannot be applied directly to
   biomedical ontologies that contain abstract concepts but almost no
   entities. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach
   called BioOntGCN that directly learns embeddings of ontology-pairs for
   biomedical ontology matching. Specifically, we first generate a pairwise
   connectivity graph (PCG) of two ontologies, whose nodes are
   concept-pairs and edges correspond to property-pairs. Subsequently, we
   learn node embeddings of the PCG to predicate the matching results
   through following phases: 1) A convolutional neural network (CNN) to
   extract the similarity feature vectors of nodes; 2) A graph
   convolutional network (GCN) to propagate the similarity features and
   obtain the final embeddings of concept-pairs. Consequently, the
   biomedical ontology matching problem is transformed into a binary
   classification problem. We conduct systematic experiments on real-world
   biomedical ontologies in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
   (OAEI), and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms
   other entity alignment methods and achieves stateof-the-art performance.
   This indicates that BioOntGCN is more applicable to ontology matching
   than the EA method. At the same time, BioOntGCN substantially achieves
   superior performance compared with previous ontology matching (OM)
   systems, which suggests that BioOntGCN based on the representation
   learning is more effective than the traditional approaches.

AB Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) has extensive application prospect of
   photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can be attributed to the
   biocompatibility and photosensitivity. However, it suffers from the
   near-ultraviolet absorption edge and low reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   release rate. This work exhibits an atomic-thickness water-soluble
   g-C3N4 with alkali Zn (2+) and K(+ )modification (MCN), whose absorption
   edge is tuned from 460 nm for GCN to the entire visible-light region
   (663 nm), and bandgap is reduced to 1.94 eV. Both K+- bridging
   intercalation and the in-plane Zn-N significantly enhance the
   photocatalytic performance, as well as inhibit the overexpression of
   glutathione (GSH) significantly. The synergistic effect make that the
   release rate of ROS is about 45.16 % (7.95 % for pristine g-C3N4),
   accomplishing a considerable inactivation efficiency of malignant
   melanoma A375. This work fundamentally releases the limitation of g-C3N4
   as a PDT photosensitizer, revealing its multifunctional promise to
   cancer therapy.

AB The current trend in improving the energy efficiency of cooling systems
   in buildings focuses on utilizing the thermal comfort state of the
   occupants as the real-time temperature control criterion. This new trend
   puts forward new requirements on the accuracy and efficiency of thermal
   sensation recognition. This paper focuses on developing the capability
   to automatically evaluate and detect thermal sensations from human
   behavior from surveillance video. The proposed approach is based solely
   on the real-time visual status of humans and assumes that the
   thermal-adaptive behavior of people contains a variety of information
   that allows for inferences about the temperature comfort of a room. To
   this end, we develop a technique to apply thermal-adaptive behavior
   recognition to thermal sensation inference based on a spatial temporal
   graph convolutional network (ST-GCN). The approach can recognize 16
   thermal-adaptive behaviors, which collected from two questionnaires were
   conducted at Shandong Normal University, in surveillance videos in real
   time. Based on the collected data, we release a video dataset of thermal
   adaptive behaviors and extensively evaluate the proposed approach on the
   newly collected thermal adaptive behavior video benchmark. The
   experimental results show that the median prediction accuracy of thermal
   sensation is up to 78% when all actions are considered, which
   demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

AB Selective production of aromatic aldehydes is an important challenge in
   the synthesis of fine chemicals. This study presents a viable strategy
   for the production of benzaldehyde using a magnetic recoverable
   photocatalyst. Graphitic carbon nitride was submitted to a thermal
   post-treatment, for partial exfoliation (g-CN-T) and combined with
   magnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4. The composite containing 18 wt.% of
   Fe3O4 shows a remarkable magnetic response. The efficiency of this
   composite was evaluated in the selective photocatalytic conversion of
   benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde. A good compromise was observed in
   terms of selectivity for benzaldehyde formation and ability of recovery
   at the end of the photocatalytic reaction by the application of a
   magnetic field. Reutilization experiments using this hybrid material
   revealed a slight decrease of efficiency after the first run only.
   Moreover, hydrogen was generated during the photocatalytic production of
   benzaldehyde. Thus, the combination of gCN-T and magnetic nanoparticles
   provided an impetus to design a photocatalyst with easy and inexpensive
   features for selective synthesis of organic compounds.

AB Graph Neural Network (GNN) has received tremendous attention due to
   their power in learning graph representations by modeling the
   topological structure and aggregating feature information. However, the
   scalar node representations learned from GNN may not be sufficient to
   effectively preserve the attributes of the node/graph features,
   resulting in suboptimal graph representation. Repeated averaging gathers
   too much noise, which makes the features of nodes in different classes
   over-mixed and leads to the problem of over smoothing. Inspired by the
   concept of capsule network proposed by Hinton, we propose a new
   framework for graph classification, named CapsualGNN, which takes full
   advantage of Graph Neural Network and Capsule Network. Specifically, we
   firstly represent nodes as groups of capsules, in which each capsule
   extracts distinctive features of its corresponding node. Then, we
   exploit routing mechanism to capture important information and
   properties at the graph level by the generated multiple embeddings for
   each graph, and utilize attention mechanism to focus on important
   features. Finally, to solve the problem of over smoothing, we introduce
   class residual connection for GCN. In addition, we also introduce
   parameter for distinguishing self-connected nodes and other nodes. We
   evaluate the framework by using six graph datasets on biological
   information and social networks, and demonstrate that CapsualGNN
   outperforms other SOTA techniques on the task of graph classification.

AB Few-shot object detection methods have made prodigious progress in
   recent years. However, these methods are designed for optical images at
   a single scale, which leads to significantly degraded detection
   performance due to object scale variation of remote sensing images. In
   this letter, we propose a few-shot object detection method for the
   problem of scale variation in remote sensing images. More specifically,
   our model contains two main components: a context-aware pixel
   aggregation (CPA) that allows the model to adapt to objects at different
   scales through different scale convolution and a context-aware feature
   aggregation (CFA) that enhances context awareness to obtain more
   semantic information through a graph convolution network (GCN).
   Experiments on the DIOR dataset demonstrate that our model can achieve a
   satisfying detection performance on remote sensing images, and our model
   performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art model.

AB Image retrieval is one of the most critical foundations for many
   content-based search applications. However, the image retrieval methods
   have to balance demands on both training accuracy and generalization
   effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a graph convolution network
   (GCN) to improve retrieval robustness by integrating the constructs of
   normalized residual network (NRN) model and feature dropout (FD)
   operations. The normalized residual networks use skip connection and
   normalize vectors in each layer to enhance the learning and strengthen
   the generalization ability. The feature dropout step randomly discards a
   portion of features in the network to prevent the model from
   overfitting. We tested our proposed model on several benchmark datasets
   and the experiment results showed an improvement of 1-3 mAP in
   comparison with the state-of-the-art Guided Similarity Separation (GSS)
   algorithm.

AB Speech emotion recognition is a key branch of affective computing.
   Nowadays, it is common to detect emotional diseases through speech
   emotion recognition. Various detection methods of emotion recognition,
   such as LTSM, GCN, and CNN, show excellent performance. However, due to
   the robustness of the model, the recognition results of the above models
   will have a large deviation. So in this article, we use black boxes to
   combat sample attacks to explore the robustness of the model. After
   using three different black-box attacks, the accuracy of the CNN-MAA
   model decreased by 69.38% at the best attack scenario, while the word
   error rate (WER) of voice decreased by only 6.24%, indicating that the
   robustness of the model does not perform well under our black-box attack
   method. After adversarial training, the model accuracy only decreased by
   13.48%, which shows the effectiveness of adversarial training against
   sample attacks. Our code is available in Github.

AB Neural networks and deep learning have been successfully applied to
   tackle problems in drug discovery with increasing accuracy over time.
   There are still many challenges and opportunities to improve molecular
   property predictions with satisfactory accuracy even further. Here, we
   proposed a deep-learning architecture model, namely Bidirectional long
   short-term memory with Channel and Spatial Attention network (BCSA), of
   which the training process is fully data-driven and end to end. It is
   based on data augmentation and SMILES tokenization technology without
   relying on auxiliary knowledge, such as complex spatial structure. In
   addition, our model takes the advantages of the long- and short-term
   memory network (LSTM) in sequence processing. The embedded channel and
   spatial attention modules in turn specifically identify the prime
   factors in the SMILES sequence for predicting properties. The model was
   further improved by Bayesian optimization. In this work, we demonstrate
   that the trained BSCA model is capable of predicting aqueous solubility.
   Furthermore, our proposed method shows noticeable superiorities and
   competitiveness in predicting oil-water partition coefficient, when
   compared with state-of-the-art graphs models, including graph convoluted
   network (GCN), message-passing neural network (MPNN), and AttentiveFP.

AB Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) embed nodes in a graph into
   Euclidean space, which has been shown to incur a large distortion when
   embedding real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure.
   Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables
   embeddings with much smaller distortion. However, extending GCNs to
   hyperbolic geometry presents several unique challenges because it is not
   clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature
   transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, since
   input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the
   features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature.
   Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN),
   the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the
   expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node
   representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs. We derive GCNs
   operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map
   Euclidean input features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with
   different trainable curvature at each layer. Experiments demonstrate
   that HGCN learns embeddings that preserve hierarchical structure, and
   leads to improved performance when compared to Euclidean analogs, even
   with very low dimensional embeddings: compared to state-of-the-art GCNs,
   HGCN achieves an error reduction of up to 63.1% in ROC AUC for link
   prediction and of up to 47.5% in F1 score for node classification, also
   improving state-of-the art on the Pubmed dataset.

AB Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a long-term but challenging task
   for online car-hailing system decision, taxi scheduling and intelligent
   transportation construction. Accurate urban ridehailing demand
   prediction can improve vehicle utilization and scheduling, reduce
   waiting time and traffic congestion. Existing traffic flow prediction
   approaches mainly utilize region-based situation awareness image or
   station-based graph representation to capture traffic spatial dynamic
   while we observe that combination of situation awareness image and graph
   representation are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this
   paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion
   Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse
   multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation.
   MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural
   Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence
   Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of
   urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial
   features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the
   spatio-temporal dynamics. We evaluate the proposed model on two
   real-world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental
   studies demonstrate MSTIF-Net has achieved superior performance of urban
   ride-Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional
   state-of-art baseline models.

AB Link prediction, which is used to identify the potential relationship
   between nodes, is an important issue in network science. In existing
   studies, the traditional methods based on the structural similarity of
   nodes make it challenging to complete the task of link prediction in
   large-scale or sparse networks. Although emerging methods based on deep
   learning can solve this problem, most of the work mainly completes the
   link prediction through the similarity of the representation vector of
   network structure information. Many empirical studies show that link
   formation is affected by node attributes, and similarity is not the only
   criterion for the formation of links in reality. Accordingly, this paper
   proposed a two-stage deep-learning model for link prediction (i.e,
   TDLP), where the node representation vector of the network structure and
   attributes was obtained in the first stage, while link prediction was
   realized through supervised learning in the second stage. The empirical
   results on real networks showed that our model significantly outperforms
   the traditional methods (e.g., CN and RA), as well as newly proposed
   deep-learning methods (e.g., GCN and VGAE). This study not only proposed
   a deep-learning framework for link prediction from the perspective of
   structure and attribute fusion and link distribution capture, but also
   lays a methodological foundation for practical applications based on
   link prediction.

AB The graph convolution algorithm currently suffers from the drawback of
   not fusing point cloud information and point cloud topology structure
   information based on visual selectivity features and using absolute
   quantities like distance as features, resulting in the algorithm losing
   geometric invariance. This information serves as the foundation for the
   "Graph Convolution Algorithm Based on Visual Selectivity and Application
   of Point Cloud Analysis". In order to propose a graph convolutional
   kernel and its design method based on visual selectivity, the algorithm
   analyzes the global characteristics of the point cloud "close in the
   vicinity and sparse in the distance," the local selectivity of the point
   cloud topology structure in the neighborhood, and the consistency
   between features and visual selectivity of primates. By combining point
   cloud information with point cloud topology structure information
   features, a graph convolution computation method was built, and the
   algorithm's geometric invariance was confirmed. The recognition and
   semantic segmentation performances of the approach in this study were
   verified using the ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart data sets in comparison
   to the PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, KPConv, and 3D-GCN algorithms. The
   experimental design demonstrates that the algorithm presented in this
   research is accurate and practical, has geometric invariance, and
   performs better at semantic segmentation and recognition than
   conventional algorithms.

AB Time-series transcriptomes of a biological process obtained under
   different conditions are useful for identifying the regulators of the
   process and their regulatory networks. However, such data are 3D (gene
   expression, time, and condition), and there is currently no method that
   can deal with their full complexity. Here, we developed a method that
   avoids time-point alignment and normalization between conditions. We
   applied it to analyze time-series transcriptomes of developing maize
   leaves under light-dark cycles and under total darkness and obtained
   eight time-ordered gene coexpression networks (TO-GCNs), which can be
   used to predict upstream regulators of any genes in the GCNs. One of the
   eight TO-GCNs is light-independent and likely includes all genes
   involved in the development of Kranz anatomy, which is a structure
   crucial for the high efficiency of photosynthesis in C-4 plants. Using
   this TO-GCN, we predicted and experimentally validated a regulatory
   cascade upstream of SHORTROOT1, a key Kranz anatomy regulator. Moreover,
   we applied the method to compare transcriptomes from maize and rice leaf
   segments and identified regulators of maize C-4 enzyme genes and RUBISCO
   SMALL SUBUNIT2. Our study provides not only a powerful method but also
   novel insights into the regulatory networks underlying Kranz anatomy

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability in
   the task of semi-supervised node classification. However, most existing
   GNNs suffer from the nonrobustness issues, which poses a great challenge
   for applying GNNs into sensitive scenarios. Some researchers concentrate
   on constructing an ensemble model to mitigate the nonrobustness issues.
   Nevertheless, these methods ignore the interaction among base models,
   leading to similar graph representations. Moreover, due to the
   deterministic propagation applied in most existing GNNs, each node
   highly relies on its neighbors, leaving the nodes to be sensitive to
   perturbations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of
   graph ensemble learning based on knowledge passing (called GEL) to
   address the above issues. In order to achieve interaction, we consider
   the predictions of prior models as knowledge to obtain more reliable
   predictions. Moreover, we design a multilayer DropNode propagation
   strategy to reduce each node's dependence on particular neighbors. This
   strategy also empowers each node to aggregate information from diverse
   neighbors, alleviating oversmoothing issues. We conduct experiments on
   three benchmark datasets, including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. GEL
   outperforms GCN by more than 5% in terms of accuracy across all three
   datasets and also performs better than other state-of-the-art baselines.
   Extensive experimental results also show that the GEL alleviates the
   nonrobustness and oversmoothing issues.

AB Multi-hop reading comprehension focuses on one type of factoid question,
   where a system needs to properly integrate multiple pieces of evidence
   to correctly answer a question. Previous work approximates global
   evidence with local coreference information, encoding coreference chains
   with DAG-styled GRU layers within a gated-attention reader. However,
   coreference is limited in providing information for rich inference. We
   introduce a new method for better connecting global evidence, which
   forms more complex graphs compared to DAGs. To perform evidence
   integration on our graphs, we investigate two recent graph neural
   networks, namely graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph recurrent
   network (GRN). Experiments on two standard datasets show that richer
   global information leads to better answers. Our approach shows highly
   competitive performances on these datasets without deep language models
   (such as ELMo).

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the role of flying anchor nodes have
   been proposed to assist the localisation of terrestrial Internet of
   Things (IoT) sensors and provide relay services in the context of the
   upcoming 6G networks. This paper considered the objective of tracing a
   mobile IoT device of unknown location, using a group of UAVs that were
   equipped with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) sensors. The
   UAVs employed measurements of the target's radio frequency (RF) signal
   power to approach the target as quickly as possible. A deep learning
   model performed clustering in the UAV network at regular intervals,
   based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture, which
   utilised information about the RSSI and the UAV positions. The number of
   clusters was determined dynamically at each instant using a heuristic
   method, and the partitions were determined by optimising an RSSI loss
   function. The proposed algorithm retained the clusters that approached
   the RF source more effectively, removing the rest of the UAVs, which
   returned to the base. Simulation experiments demonstrated the
   improvement of this method compared to a previous deterministic
   approach, in terms of the time required to reach the target and the
   total distance covered by the UAVs.

AB Carbon-based-materials, owing to their wide availability and low cost,
   have been utilized for a variety of applications including heterogeneous
   catalysis. Various carbonaceous materials have been used as supports for
   transition metals or other materials. These support materials have shown
   their potential for development of green and sustainable approaches to
   heterogeneous catalysis. In this review, we discuss the utilization of
   carbon-based materials as supports for heterogeneous catalysts,
   especially in organic transformations. We have focused our discussions
   predominantly on four categories of carbonaceous supports, namely
   graphene (including, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide
   (RGO)), graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and
   activated carbon (AC) for various organic transformation reactions.
   Several approaches for the synthesis of these materials along with their
   application as heterogeneous catalysts for organic transformation
   reactions have been elaborated in detail. In addition, different aspects
   of organic synthesis, including hydrogenation, oxidation, reduction,
   condensation, and multi-component reactions, catalyzed by these
   materials have been discussed. Furthermore, organic transformations
   leading to the sustainable synthesis of valuable products from biomass
   have also been discussed. Finally, after a brief summary, the future
   perspectives of this very interesting class of materials are provided.

AB Extraction of traffic features constitutes a key research direction in
   traffic safety planning. In previous traffic tasks, road network
   features are extracted manually. In contrast, Network Representation
   Learning aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node
   representations. Enlightened by feature learning in Natural Language
   Processing, representation learning of urban nodes is studied as a
   supervised task in this paper. Following this line of thinking, a deep
   learning framework, called StreetNode2VEC, is proposed for learning
   feature representations for nodes in the road network based on travel
   routes, and then model parameter calibration is performed. We explain
   the effectiveness of features from visualization, similarity analysis,
   and link prediction. In visualization, the features of nodes naturally
   present a clustered pattern, and different clusters correspond to
   different regions in the road network. Meanwhile, the features of nodes
   still retain their spatial information in similarity analysis. The
   proposed method StreetNode2VEC obtains a AUC score of 0.813 in link
   prediction, which is greater than that obtained from Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) and Node2vec. This suggests that the features of nodes can
   be used to effectively and credibly predict whether a link should be
   established between two nodes. Overall, our work provides a new way of
   representing road nodes in the road network, which have potential in the
   traffic safety planning field.

AB Although deep learning-based methods have been successfully applied to
   polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification
   tasks, most of the available techniques are not suitable to deal with
   PolSAR data on irregular domains, e.g., superpixel graphs, because they
   are naturally designed as grid-based architectures in Euclidean space.
   To overcome this limitation and achieve robust PolSAR image
   classification, this article proposes the multiscale evolving weighted
   graph convolutional network, where weighted graphs based on superpixel
   technique and Wishart-derived distance are constructed to enable
   efficient handling of graphical PolSAR data representations. In this
   article, we derive a new architectural design named graph evolving
   module that combines pairwise latent feature similarity and kernel
   diffusion to refine the graph structure in each scale. Finally, we
   propose a graph integration module based on self-attention to perform
   robust hierarchical feature extraction and learn an optimal linear
   combination of various scales to exploit effective feature propagation
   on multiple graphs. We validate the superiority of proposed approach on
   classification performance with four real-measured datasets and
   demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
   methods. Additionally, the proposed method has shown strong
   generalization capacity across datasets with similar land covers.

AB Learning brain effective connectivity networks (ECN) from functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has gained much attention in
   recent years. With the successful applications of deep learning in
   numerous fields, several brain ECN learning methods based on deep
   learning have been reported in the literature. However, current methods
   ignore the deep temporal features of fMRI data and fail to fully employ
   the spatial topological relationship between brain regions. In this
   article, we propose a novel method for learning brain ECN based on
   spatiotemporal graph convolutional models (STGCM), named STGCMEC, in
   which we first adopt the temporal convolutional network to extract the
   deep temporal features of fMRI data and utilize the graph convolutional
   network to update the spatial features of each brain region by
   aggregating information from neighborhoods, which makes the features of
   brain regions more discriminative. Then, based on such features of brain
   regions, we design a joint loss function to guide STGCMEC to learn the
   brain ECN, which includes a task prediction loss and a graph
   regularization loss. The experimental results on a simulated dataset and
   a real Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset show
   that the proposed STGCMEC is able to better learn brain ECN compared
   with some state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recently, advanced techniques in deep learning such as recurrent neural
   network (GRU, LSTM and Bi-LSTM) and auto-encoding (attention-based
   transformer and BERT) have achieved great successes in multiple
   application domains including text summarization. Recent
   state-of-the-art encoding-based text summarization models such as
   BertSum, PreSum and DiscoBert have demonstrated significant improvements
   on extractive text summarization tasks. However, recent models still
   encounter common problems related to the language-specific dependency
   which requires the supports of the external NLP tools. Besides that,
   recent advanced text representation methods, such as BERT as the
   sentence-level textual encoder, also fail to fully capture the
   representation of a full-length document. To address these challenges,
   in this paper we proposed a novel semantic-ware embedding approach for
   extractive text summarization, called as: SE4ExSum. Our proposed
   SE4ExSum is an integration between the use of feature graph-of-words
   (FGOW) with BERTbased encoder for effectively learning the
   word/sentence-level representations of a given document. Then, the graph
   convolutional network (GCN) based encoder is applied to learn the global
   document's representation which is then used to facilitate the text
   summarization task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the
   effectiveness of our proposed model in comparing with recent
   state-of-the-art text summarization models.

AB Vibration signals always contain noise and irregularities, which makes
   spectrum analysis difficult to extract high-level features. Recently,
   graph theory has been applied to spectrum analysis to improve the
   performance of feature extraction. By converting the raw data into
   graphs, hidden structural and topological information can be obtained.
   In this article, a spatial-temporal graph-based feature extraction,
   called SuperGraph, for rotating machinery fault diagnosis is proposed.
   Specifically, graph theory-based spectrum analysis is used to construct
   the spatial-temporal graph. Then, the Laplacian matrix-based feature
   vector is extracted from the constructed spatial-temporal graph. By this
   means, the spatial-temporal graph is converted into the one-dimensional
   (1-D) vector for further constructing SuperGraph, where each node of the
   SuperGraph represents a spatial-temporal graph and the SuperGraph is
   composed of many local graphs. In the local graph, only the same type of
   nodes are connected to form a fully connected graph. Thus, the task of
   graph classification can be transformed into classifying the nodes in
   the SuperGraph. After graph convolutional network is established for
   learning and obtaining deep features, the label of nodes is identified
   from a soft m (LE model. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarking
   datasets and a practical experimental platform to verify effectiveness
   of the proposed fault diagnosis method.

AB The rational design and synthesis of a non-noble-metal electrocatalyst
   for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER) with good conductivity, high efficiency, and excellent stability
   are major challenges in the field of renewable energy. Therefore, we
   developed a simple and effective method to grow ZIF-67 in situ on
   graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and then annealed it to generate
   nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) loaded with CO@C nanoparticles (Co@C/NC).
   Benefiting from this in situ growth method, after annealing, a large
   number of N atoms on the surface of NC nanosheets anchor more metal Co
   to form more catalytic Co-N active sites. At the same time, the Co@C/NC
   composites use NC nanosheets as the matrix, which can improve the
   electrochemical double-layer capacitance and conductivity of the
   composites. As demonstrated in electrochemical measurements, the OER and
   HER overpotentials of Co@C/NC composites at a current density of 10 mA
   cm(-2) were only 300 and 175.4 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The
   preparation method is suitable for synthesizing various metal and carbon
   composite electrocatalysts. It provides ideas for designing and
   manufacturing high-performance non-noble-metal dual-function OER/HER

AB Background and objective Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a
   genetic disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of GCN triplets within
   the PABPN1 gene. Previous descriptions have focused on lower limb
   muscles in small cohorts of patients with OPMD, but larger imaging
   studies have not been performed. Previous imaging studies have been too
   small to be able to correlate imaging findings to genetic and clinical
   data.
   Methods We present cross-sectional, T1-weighted muscle MRI and CT-scan
   data from 168 patients with genetically confirmed OPMD. We have analysed
   the pattern of muscle involvement in the disease using hierarchical
   analysis and presented it as heatmaps. Results of the scans were
   correlated with genetic and clinical data.
   Results Fatty replacement was identified in 96.7% of all symptomatic
   patients. The tongue, the adductor magnus and the soleus were the most
   commonly affected muscles. Muscle pathology on MRI correlated positively
   with disease duration and functional impairment.
   Conclusions We have described a pattern that can be considered
   characteristic of OPMD. An early combination of fat replacement in the
   tongue, adductor magnus and soleus can be helpful for differential
   diagnosis. The findings suggest the natural history of the disease from
   a radiological point of view. The information generated by this study is
   of high diagnostic value and important for clinical trial development.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph learning
   tasks. The main aspect of GNN's layer-wise message passing is conducting
   attribute/feature propagation on graph. Most existing GNNs generally
   conduct feature propagation across all feature dimensions. However, in
   many real applications, attributes usually contain irrelevant and
   redundant noise. In this case, attribute/feature selection is de-sired
   to extract meaningful features and eliminate noisy ones for GNN's
   layer-wise propagation. Based on this observation, in this paper, we
   combine I; 2 , 1 /I; 1-norm regularized attribute selection and GNNs
   together and propose a novel Attribute selection guided GNNs (AsGNNs)
   for graph data representation. AsGNNs aim to adaptively select some
   desired meaningful features/attributes that best serve GNNs. More-over,
   an effective optimization framework has also been derived to train the
   proposed AsGNNs. The pro-posed AsGNNs provide a general framework which
   can incorporate any GNNs to conduct feature selection for layer-wise
   propagation. In this paper, we implement AsGNNs on both graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT) and
   develop AsGCN and AsGAT for graph learning. Experimen-tal results on
   several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   AsGNNs (AsGCN, AsGAT) on semi-supervised learning tasks.(c) 2022

AB Portfolio management is a decision-making process of periodically
   reallocating a certain amount of funds into a portfolio of assets, with
   the objective of maximizing the profits constrained to a given risk
   level. Due to its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and
   planning for long-run performance, reinforcement learning (RL) recently
   has received much attention in portfolio management. However, most of
   existing RL-based PM approaches in general only consider price changes
   of portfolio assets and the implicit correlations between price changes,
   while ignoring the rich relations between companies in the market, such
   as two assets in the same sector or two companies have a
   supplier-customer relation, which are very important for trading
   decision making. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose
   GPM, a novel graph convolutional network-based reinforcement learning
   framework for portfolio management, which first employs Relational Graph
   Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to extract asset relational features, and
   then combines relational features with multi-scale temporal features to
   make trading decisions for better performance. We also introduce softmax
   with temperature to increase portfolio diversity, which leads to further
   increase in profits. Experimental results on two real-world datasets:
   NASDAQ and NYSE, validate the effectiveness of GPM over state-of-the-art
   PM methods. Further, more experiments are conducted to evaluate GPM with
   different graph neural networks and different number of network layers,
   to explore proper settings for different markets. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the rapid development of intelligent operation and management in
   metro systems, accurate network-scale passenger flow prediction has
   become an essential component in real-time metro management. Although
   numerous novel methods have been applied in this field, critical
   barriers still exist in integrating travel behaviors and comprehensive
   spatiotemporal dependencies into prediction. This study constructs the
   metro system as a knowledge graph and proposes a split-attention
   relational graph convolutional network (SARGCN) to address these
   challenges. Breaking the limitations of physical metro networks, we
   develop a metro topological graph construction method based on the
   historical origin-destination (OD) matrix to involve travel behaviors.
   Then, we design a metro knowledge graph construction method to
   incorporate land-use features. To adapt prior knowledge of metro
   systems, we subsequently propose the SARGCN model for network-scale
   metro passenger flow pre-diction. This model integrates the relational
   graph convolutional network (R-GCN), split-attention mechanism, and long
   short-term memory (LSTM) to explore the spatiotemporal correlations and
   dependence between pas-senger inflow and outflow. According to the model
   validation conducted on the metro systems in Shenzhen and Hangzhou,
   China, the SARGCN model outperforms the advanced baselines. Furthermore,
   quantitative experi-ments also reveal the effectiveness of its component
   and the constructed metro knowledge graph.

AB Knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, Freebase or Wikidata always contain a
   taxonomic backbone that allows the arrangement and structuring of
   various concepts in accordance with hypo-hypernym ("class-subclass")
   relationship. With the rapid growth of lexical resources for specific
   domains, the problem of automatic extension of the existing knowledge
   bases with new words is becoming more and more widespread. In this
   paper, we address the problem of taxonomy enrichment which aims at
   adding new words to the existing taxonomy.
   We present a new method which allows achieving high results on this task
   with little effort. It uses the resources which exist for the majority
   of languages, making the method universal. We extend our method by
   incorporating deep representations of graph structures like node2vec,
   Poincare embeddings, GCN etc. that have recently demonstrated promising
   results on various NLP tasks. Furthermore, combining these
   representations with word embeddings allows us to beat the state of the
   art.
   We conduct a comprehensive study of the existing approaches to taxonomy
   enrichment based on word and graph vector representations and their
   fusion approaches. We also explore the ways of using deep learning
   architectures to extend taxonomic backbones of knowledge graphs. We
   create a number of datasets for taxonomy extension for English and
   Russian. We achieve state-of-the-art results across different datasets
   and provide an in-depth error analysis of mistakes.

AB Graph clustering, aiming to partition nodes of a graph into various
   groups via an unsupervised approach, is an attractive topic in recent
   years. To improve the representative ability, several graph auto-encoder
   (GAE) models, which are based on semisupervised graph convolution
   networks (GCN), have been developed and they have achieved impressive
   results compared with traditional clustering methods. However, all
   existing methods either fail to utilize the orthogonal property of the
   representations generated by GAE or separate the clustering and the
   training of neural networks. We first prove that the relaxed k-means
   will obtain an optimal partition in the inner-product distance used
   space. Driven by theoretical analysis about relaxed k-means, we design a
   specific GAE-based model for graph clustering to be consistent with the
   theory, namely Embedding GAE (EGAE). The learned representations are
   well explainable so that the representations can be also used for other
   tasks. To induce the neural network to produce deep features that are
   appropriate for the specific clustering model, the relaxed k-means and
   GAE are learned simultaneously. Meanwhile, the relaxed k-means can be
   equivalently regarded as a decoder that attempts to learn
   representations that can be linearly constructed by some centroid
   vectors. Accordingly, EGAE consists of one encoder and dual decoders.
   Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of EGAE and
   the corresponding theoretical analyses.

AB In EGFR-treatment naive NSCLC patients, high-level MET amplification is
   detected in approximately 2-3% and is considered as adverse prognostic
   factor. Currently, clinical trials with two different inhibitors,
   capmatinib and tepotinib, are under way both defining different
   inclusion criteria regarding MET amplification from proven amplification
   only to defining an exact MET copy number. Here, 45 patient samples,
   including 10 samples without MET amplification, 5 samples showing a
   low-level MET amplification, 10 samples with an intermediate-level MET
   amplification, 10 samples having a high-level MET amplification by a
   MET/CEN7 ratio >= 2.0 and 10 samples showing a high-level MET
   amplification with GCN >= 6, were evaluated by MET FISH, MET IHC, a
   ddPCR copy number assay, a NanoString nCounter copy number assay and an
   amplicon-based parallel sequencing. The MET IHC had the best concordance
   with MET FISH followed by the NanoString copy number assay, the ddPCR
   copy number assay and the custom ampliconbased parallel sequencing
   assays. The concordance was higher in the high-level amplified cohorts
   than in the low- and intermediate-level amplified cohorts. In summary,
   currently extraction-based methods cannot replace the MET FISH for the
   detection of low-level, intermediate-level and high-level MET
   amplifications, as the number of false negative results is very high.
   Only for the detection of high-level amplified samples with a gene copy
   number >= 6 extraction-based methods are a reliable alternative. (C)

AB This paper studies the methodology of inferring bullish or bearish
   sentiments in the financial domain. The task aims to predict a real
   value to represent the sentiment intensity concerning a target (company
   or stock symbol) in a text. Previous researches have proved the validity
   of using deep neural networks to automatically learn semantic and
   syntactic information for sentiment prediction. Despite the promising
   performance, these approaches implicitly obtain the target-sentiment
   representation by a sentence-level vector, lacking explicitly modeling
   the semantic relatedness between a target and its context. In this
   paper, we tackle the task by a novel semantic and syntactic enhanced
   neural model (SSENM), which incorporates dependency graph and context
   words to guide a target representation. In particular, we devise a
   self-attentive mechanism to capture semantic contextual information and
   an edge-enhanced graph convolutional network (E-GCN) to aggregate
   node-to-node features. In addition, the existing FSA is limited in size,
   which is prone to the overfitting problem for modern neural models. We
   further develop a Manifold Mixup strategy to generate pseudo data in
   training. We perform extensive experiments on two public benchmarks,
   SemEval2017task5 and FiQA challenges. Results show that our model
   outperforms the state-of-the-art model by 2% wcs scores on
   SemEval2017task5 and 3% R-2 scores on FiQA, respectively. Finally, we
   present detailed analysis to indicate the effectiveness of each proposed
   component.

AB In the skeleton-based action recognition, mining information from the
   joints and limbs of human skeletons plays a key role. Previous studies
   treated the skeleton data as vectors and could not explicitly capture
   the joint interactions (e.g., RNN-based methods), or modeled the joint
   interactions in a local manner and may lose important cues without
   global response mapping (e.g., CNN and GCN (Graph Convolution Network)
   based methods). In this work, we address these problems by considering
   the potential relations of all the node pairs and edge pairs on the
   skeleton graphs. A dilation group-specific convolution module is
   proposed to aggregate relation messages of all the unit pairs on the
   skeleton graphs. By enumerating all the pair relations, the joint
   interactions could be learned explicitly and globally. It is then
   enhanced by introducing the attention pooling including temporal
   attention, spatial attention and channel attention. By stacking such
   several blocks, the relation messages of the node pairs are augmented by
   multi-layer propagation. Finally, the late fusion of four streams is
   used to combine the predictions of different inputs including node
   pairs, edge pairs and corresponding frame differences. The proposed
   method, termed cony-relation network, achieves competitive performance
   on two large scale datasets, NTU RGB+D and Kinetics. (C) 2019 Elsevier

AB Orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) has been proved to play an important role in
   the regulation of emotions, addiction, panic, or anxiety, and thus been
   a promising drug target for the treatments of drug addiction, anxiety,
   and depression, pain, and obesity. In this work, GRU-based deep neural
   network combined with transfer learning was successfully used to build a
   molecular generation model of OX1R antagonists by using 2,066,376
   drug-like molecules from ChEMBL database and 11525 known OX1R
   antagonists. The results showed that the GRU-based generation model can
   accurately grasp the SMILES grammar of the drug-like molecules and tend
   to generate potential OX1R antagonists after transfer learning. Then,
   graph convolutional network (GCN) with multi-head attention mechanism
   followed by a cascade of traditional ligand, receptor, and rule-based
   virtual screening was performed to screen potent OX1R antagonists from
   the generated molecules, which results in 23 de novo potential OX1R
   antagonists with good drug-like and druggability properties. Overall,
   this paper integrates the advantages of traditional and data-driven drug
   design methods and provides important references for the lead compound
   discovery of OX1R antagonists.

AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a vital role in natural language processing
   (NLP), which can serve several downstream tasks. Because different views
   of KGs are usually constructed independently, the multi-view knowledge
   graph fusion (MVKGF) becomes a hotspot. Although multi-view learning
   studied very well in past decades, MVKGF is still not well tackled
   because of the heterogeneous relations and the multi-view KGs. To
   overcome MVKGF, entity alignment is the most studied. Existing entity
   alignment methods are dominated by embedding based methods, such as
   TransE and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the alignment is achieved
   by measuring the similarities between entity embeddings. However, most
   previous approaches suffer from the issues of the diverse knowledge
   facts and the complex neighboring structures. In this paper, we propose
   a novel K nowledge-aware A ttentional G raph N eural N etwork (KAGNN)
   model to carefully incorporate both knowledge facts and neighboring
   structures. In particular, a knowledge-aware attention mechanism is
   designed to preserve the original semantics and determine the importance
   of each knowledge fact. Furthermore, a three-layered GCN with highway
   gates is adopted to learn better entity representations from the
   neighboring structure information. Thus, our model can be regarded as a
   multi-view extension of GNN. We validate our model on three
   cross-lingual datasets and the results show our model beats the
   state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

AB Deformation twinning is an important mechanism of the plastic
   deformation of materials. The density of twins also affects the
   properties of the material. At present, the research methods of
   deformation twinning mainly depend on in situ EBSD, numerically
   investigated analysis and the finite element method. The application of
   machine learning methods to material microstructure research can shorten
   the time taken for material analysis. Machine learning methods are faced
   with the problem of the effective representation of the microstructure.
   We present a deformation twinning research method based on the
   representation of grain morphology features in a knowledge graph. We
   construct an autoencoder to extract grain morphology characteristics for
   building a grain knowledge graph. Then, a graph convolutional network
   (GCN) and fully connected network are developed to extract grain
   knowledge graph features and predict the twin density of materials
   subjected to specific tensile deformation. We use Mg-2Zn-3Li alloy as an
   experimental example to predict the twin density on three indexes of
   average grain size, twin boundaries density and average grain surface.
   The R-2 score of the prediction result on the twin boundaries density is
   up to 0.510, and the R-2 score of the average grain size and average
   grain surface is over 0.750. Therefore, the proposed method for
   deformation twinning research is effective and feasible.

AB Event Causality Extraction (ECE) plays an essential role in many Natural
   Language Processing (NLP), such as event prediction and dialogue
   generation. Recent research in NLP treats ECE as a sequence labeling
   problem. However, these methods tend to extract the events and their
   relevant causality using a single collapsed model, which usually focuses
   on the textual contents while ignoring the intra-element transitions
   inside events and inter-event causality transition association across
   events. In general, ECE should condense the complex relationship of
   intra-event and the causality transition association among events.
   Therefore, we propose a novel dual-channel enhanced neural network to
   address this limitation by taking both global event mentions and
   causality transition association into account. To extract complete event
   mentions, a Textual Enhancement Channel(TEC) is constructed to learn
   important intra-event features from the training data with a wider
   perception field. Then the Knowledge Enhancement Channel(KEC)
   incorporates external causality transition knowledge using a Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) to provide complementary information on
   event causality. Finally, we design a dynamic fusion attention mechanism
   to measure the importance of the two channels. Thus, our proposed model
   can incorporate both semantic-level and knowledge-level representations
   of events to extract the relevant event causality. Experimental results
   on three public datasets show that our model outperforms the
   state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Since dementia is preventable with early interventions,
   biomarkers that assist in diagnosing early stages of dementia, such as
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are urgently needed. Methods:
   Multiomics analysis of amnestic MCI (aMCI) peripheral blood (n = 25) was
   performed covering the tran-scriptome, microRNA, proteome, and
   metabolome. Validation analysis for microRNAs was conducted in an
   inde-pendent cohort (n = 12). Artificial intelligence was used to
   identify the most important features for predicting aMCI. Findings: We
   found that hsa-miR-4455 is the best biomarker in all omics analyses. The
   diagnostic index tak-ing a ratio of hsa-miR-4455 to hsa-let-7b-3p
   predicted aMCI patients against healthy subjects with 97% over-all
   accuracy. An integrated review of multiomics data suggested that a
   subset of T cells and the GCN (general control nonderepressible) pathway
   are associated with aMCI. Interpretation: The multiomics approach has
   enabled aMCI biomarkers with high specificity and illuminated the
   accompanying changes in peripheral blood. Future large-scale studies are
   necessary to validate candidate biomarkers for clinical use. (c) 2022

AB In this work, we first applied metal-free polymeric catalysts to drive
   the photocatalytic denitrification (PCDN) reaction under visible light.
   We developed a hydrothermal-transverse thermal stripping method to
   prepare Cl/S co-doped metal-free carbon nitride nanotubes as the
   photocatalysts (Cl/S-TCN). With larger specific surface area, stronger
   light response intensity and wider light absorption range, the PCDN
   performance of Cl/S-TCN was 19 times higher than that of carbon nitride
   (GCN, obtained by direct calcination of melamine) under visible light.
   In hole scavenger experiments, the PCDN reaction was dominated by
   photo-generated electrons (e(-)) over Cl/S-TCN in acidic solutions. DFT
   calculations showed that surface Cl and S dopants preferentially
   adsorbed the O atoms in NO3- and delivered photoinduced-e(-) to N atoms
   through O atoms, ultimately breaking the N-O bond. Such reaction pathway
   was rarely reported in previous studies. Hence, this work contributes to
   the first insight into PCDN catalyzed by atomically modified metal-free
   photocatalyst under visible light.

AB INTRODUCTION AN IMPORTANCE: Testicular epidermoid cysts (TECs) are rare
   benign testicular neoplasms. Recently, testicular epidermoid cysts
   (TECs) are listed as teratoma of prepubertal type, however it is still
   difficult to differentiate the epidermoid cyst from malign testicular
   tumor. Therefore, we would like to report testicular epidermoid cyst at
   our institution.
   CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man from Indonesia, presented with
   chronical painless mass of testis since one year ago. On physical
   examination obtained normal penile structure with descended testicles,
   palpable intrascrotal mass with size of 10*7*5cm, firm consistency,
   immobile, without any tenderness, and no lymphadenophaty in groin.
   Scrotal USG showed intratesticular mass, homogenous parenchym, showed no
   vascularization during Doppler examination. Histopathological
   examination revealed the specimen of right scrotum with size of
   12.5cm*8.5cm*6.1cm with red-brownish colored, during lamellation,
   obtained encapsulated mass with size of 12.2cm*7.9cm*6cm, hollowed space
   filled with porridge-like texture with capsule thickness of 0.1-0.3cm.
   CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Epidermoid cysts are benign lesions occurring on
   the skin usually, however, it rarely occurs in intratesticular area.
   Most of the cases (60%) presented with the typical onion-ring
   phenomenon. Histopathological findings commonly revealed typical
   well-defined cyst lined by a fibrous membrane. No skin appendages are
   found in the cyst's lumen and no germ cell neoplasm (GCN) is present in
   the adjacent testicular parenchyma.
   CONCLUSION: All testicular masses are considered malignant until proven
   otherwise. It is necessary to do accurate diagnosis for the prevention
   of unnecessary radical orchiectomy.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine sentiment polarities
   toward specific aspect terms within the same sentence or document. Most
   recent studies adopted attention-based neural network models to
   implicitly connect aspect terms with context words. However, these
   studies were limited by insufficient interaction between aspect terms
   and opinion words, leading to poor performance on robustness test sets.
   In addition, we have found that robustness test sets create new
   sentences that interfere with the original information of a sentence,
   which often makes the text too long and leads to the problem of
   long-distance dependence. Simultaneously, these new sentences produce
   more non-target aspect terms, misleading the model because of the lack
   of relevant knowledge guidance. This study proposes a knowledge guided
   multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (KMGCN) to solve
   these problems. The multi-granularity attention mechanism is designed to
   enhance the interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. To
   address the long-distance dependence, KMGCN uses a graph convolutional
   network that relies on a semantic map based on fine-tuning pre-trained
   models. In particular, KMGCN uses a mask mechanism guided by conceptual
   knowledge to encounter more aspect terms (including target and
   non-target aspect terms). Experiments are conducted on 12 SemEval-2014
   variant benchmarking datasets, and the results demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs), with their efficient ability to
   capture high-order connectivity in graphs, have been widely applied in
   recommender systems. Stacking multiple neighbor aggregation is the major
   operation in GCNs. It implicitly captures popularity features because
   the number of neighbor nodes reflects the popularity of a node. However,
   existing GCN-based methods ignore a universal problem: users'
   sensitivity to item popularity is differentiated, but the neighbor
   aggregations in GCNs actually fix this sensitivity through graph
   Laplacian normalization, leading to suboptimal personalization. In this
   work, we propose to model multigrained popularity features and jointly
   learn them together with high-order connectivity to match the
   differentiation of user preferences exhibited in popularity features.
   Specifically, we develop a Joint Multigrained Popularity-aware Graph
   Convolution Collaborative Filtering model, short for JMP-GCF, which uses
   a popularity-aware embedding generation to construct multigrained
   popularity features and uses the idea of joint learning to capture the
   signals within and between different granularities of popularity
   features that are relevant for modeling user preferences. In addition,
   we propose a multistage stacked training strategy to speed up model
   convergence. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets
   to show the state-of-the-art performance of JMP-GCF. The complete codes
   of JMP-GCF are released at https://github.com/kangliu1225/JMP-GCF.

AB A series of visible-light-driven g-C3N4 nanosheet/carbon dots/Ag6Si2O7
   (signify as GCNNS/CD/ASO) photocatalysts are achieved by a facile
   precipitation procedure. Among ternary nanocomposites, the GCNNS/CD/ASO
   (10%) photocatalyst demonstrated the highest performance for degradation
   of RhB that was nearly 37.4, 10.7, and 4.3 times premier than the bare
   GCN, GCNNS, and binary GCNNS/CD photocatalysts, respectively. The
   photocatalytic ability of the GCNNS/CD/ASO (10%) nanocomposite can be
   assigned to the rapid segregation of generated e(-)/h(+) pairs, because
   CD act as electron mediator among GCNNS and ASO semiconductors.
   Furthermore, the h(+), center dot O-2(-), and center dot OH species were
   obtained as the oxidative species in the photocatalytic system by the
   scavenging tests. In addition, the degradation intermediates were
   identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Also,
   through investigating the electrochemical properties, the photocatalytic
   mechanism based on the energy bands was offered to display the increased
   e(-)/h(+) pairs separation and migration, which cause the excellent
   photocatalytic ability. This work highlights the potential application
   of extremely effective CD and Ag6Si2O7 anchored GCNNS in environmental
   applications. (C) 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published

AB The visual analysis of histopathological images is the gold standard for
   diagnosing breast cancer, yet a strenuous and an intricate task that
   requires years of pathologist training. Therefore, automating this task
   using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is highly expected. This paper
   proposes a new transfer learning-based approach to automated
   classification of breast cancer from histopathological images, including
   magnification dependent (MD) and magnification independent (MI) binary
   and eight-class classifications. We apply the deep neural network
   ResNet-18 to this problem, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, a large
   dataset of common images. We then design our transfer learning method to
   refine the network on histopathological images. Our transfer learning
   method is based on block-wise fine-tuning strategy; in which we make the
   last two residual blocks of the deep network model more domain-specific
   to our target data. It substantially helps to avoid over-fitting and
   speed up the training. Furthermore, we strengthen the adaptability of
   the proposed approach by using global contrast normalization (GCN) based
   on the target's data values and three-fold data augmentation on training
   data. The experimental results of MD and MI binary and eight-class
   classifications on the publicly available BreaKHis dataset demonstrate
   that our approach is promising and effective, outperforming recent
   state-of-the-art MD and MI counterparts by a fair margin.

AB A high efficiency hybrid electrocatalyst (Co3O4-rGO-gC(3)N(4)) was
   developed via a facile method of doping cobalt oxide (Co3O4) on reduced
   graphene oxide (rGO) supported by graphitic carbon nitride (GCN,
   g-C3N4). The synthesized composite was tested for supercapacitance and
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The results demonstrate
   excellent supercapacitance properties based on tests with two electrode
   configurations to produce capacitance of 675 F g(-1) at a current
   density of 1 A g(-1). The electrode showed excellent capacitance
   retention ability (85.4%), cycling stability (93%), high energy density
   (28.3 W h kg(-1)) and power density (0.8 kW kg(-1)). The composite
   exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution
   reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 65 mV.dec(-1), a low onset
   overpotential of 75 mV and an overpotential of -180 mV at a current
   density of 10 mA cm(-2). The performance of the doped hybrid was found
   to be superior to those reported for other metallic and non-metallic
   materials.

AB In this study, we reported a novel type-I heterojunction between red
   phosphorus and graphitic carbon nitride under vacuum condition, which is
   a novel synthesis process. For preparing the red phosphorus composites,
   the vacuum condition is appropriate to prevent it from self-ignition.
   The prepared materials were analyzed with different analytic techniques
   for the confirmation of their heterojunctions and structure formation.
   The introduction of red phosphorus into graphitic carbon nitride, reduce
   the structural defects and increase the charge separation ability. After
   medication, the synthesized composite shows an enhanced photocatalytic
   activity against acute toxicity category-III non-color (MTSM,
   Metsulfuron methyl) and color (RhB), organic pollutants. The
   photocatalytic degradation mechanism (Mott-Schottky and VB-XPS) study
   reveal that red phosphorus/graphitic carbon nitride possess type-I
   heterojunction with enhanced catalytic behavior, due to the effective
   transformation of photo-generated electrons from CB of GCN to CB of RP
   with the help of heterojunctions and due to unmoved photo holes on VBs.
   Synthesized composites also maintained their performance after reused

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been widely used in handling
   various graph data analysis tasks. For graph classification tasks,
   existing work on graph classification mainly focuses on two aspects of
   graph similarity: physical structure and practical property. In this
   paper, we consider the problem of graph classification from a new
   perspective, namely structural properties. Graph similarity is defined
   based on structural properties such as maximum clique, minimum vertex
   coverage, and minimum dominating set of graphs. To capture these
   structural features, we design an adaptive motif to mine the
   higher-order connectivity information among nodes. Furthermore, to
   obtain the unique down-sampling in graph pooling stage, we propose a
   de-correlation pooling approach. Our extensive experiments on several
   artificially generated datasets show that our proposed model can
   effectively classify graphs with similar structural property. It is also
   experimentally compared with the baseline approach to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our adaptive motif GCNs.

AB With the development of society and the improvement of people's material
   level, more and more people like to travel by airplane. If we can
   predict the passenger flow of an airline in advance, it can be used as
   an important decision-making basis for its flight route planning, crew
   scheduling planning and ticket price formulation in the process of
   management and operation. However, due to the high complexity of
   aviation network, the existing traffic prediction methods generally have
   the problem of low prediction accuracy. In order to overcome this
   problem, this paper makes full use of graph convolutional neural network
   and long-short memory network to construct a prediction system with
   short-term prediction ability. Specifically, this paper uses the graph
   convolutional neural network as a feature extraction tool to extract the
   key features of air traffic data, and solves the problem of long term
   and short term dependence between data through the long term memory
   network, then we build a high-precision air traffic prediction system
   based on it. Finally, we design a comparison experiment to compare the
   algorithm with the traditional algorithms. The results show that the
   algorithm we proposed in this paper has a higher accuracy in air flow
   prediction according to the lower loss function value.

AB Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare late onset genetic
   disease leading to ptosis, dysphagia and proximal limb muscles at later
   stages. A short abnormal (GCN) triplet expansion in the polyA-binding
   protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene leads to PABPN1-containing aggregates in
   the muscles of OPMD patients. Here we demonstrate that treating mice
   with guanabenz acetate (GA), an FDA-approved antihypertensive drug,
   reduces the size and number of nuclear aggregates, improves muscle
   force, protects myofibers from the pathology-derived turnover and
   decreases fibrosis. GA targets various cell processes, including the
   unfolded protein response (UPR), which acts to attenuate endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress. We demonstrate that GA increases both the
   phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha
   subunit and the splicing of Xbp1, key components of the UPR. Altogether
   these data show that modulation of protein folding regulation is
   beneficial for OPMD and promote the further development of GA or its
   derivatives for treatment of OPMD in humans. Furthermore, they support
   the recent evidences that treating ER stress could be therapeutically
   relevant in other more common proteinopathies.

   researchers have researched mechanism, biomarkers and targeted drugs by
   metabolites. However, compared with our knowledge about genes, RNAs, and
   proteins, we still know few about diseases-related metabolites. All the
   few existed methods for identifying diseases-related metabolites ignore
   the chemical structure of metabolites, fail to recognize the association
   pattern between metabolites and diseases, and fail to apply to isolated
   diseases and metabolites. Results: In this study, we present a graph
   deep learning based method, named Deep-DRM, for identifying
   diseases-related metabolites. First, chemical structures of metabolites
   were used to calculate similarities of metabolites. The similarities of
   diseases were obtained based on their functional gene network and
   semantic associations. Therefore, both metabolites and diseases network
   could be built. Next, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was applied to
   encode the features of metabolites and diseases, respectively. Then, the
   dimension of these features was reduced by Principal components analysis
   (PCA) with retainment 99% information. Finally, Deep neural network was
   built for identifying true metabolite-disease pairs (MDPs) based on
   these features. The 10-cross validations on three testing setups showed
   outstanding AUC (0.952) and AUPR (0.939) of Deep-DRM compared with
   previous methods and similar approaches. Ten of top 15 predicted
   associations between diseases and metabolites got support by other
   studies, which suggests that Deep-DRM is an efficient method to identify
   MDPs.

   glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in physiological buffer (PBS, pH 7.4). GCN
   was prepared by pyrolysis of agriculture urea precursor and

AB In electricity markets, locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting is
   particularly important for market participants in making reasonable
   bidding strategies, managing potential trading risks, and supporting
   efficient system planning and operation. Unlike existing methods that
   only consider LMPs' temporal features, this paper tailors a spectral
   graph convolutional network (GCN) to greatly improve the accuracy of
   short-term LMP forecasting. A three-branch network structure is then
   designed to match the structure of LMPs' compositions. Such kind of
   network can extract the spatial-temporal features of LMPs, and provide
   fast and high-quality predictions for all nodes simultaneously. The
   attention mechanism is also implemented to assign varying importance
   weights between different nodes and time slots. Case studies based on
   the IEEE-118 test system and real-world data from the PJM validate that
   the proposed model outperforms existing forecasting models in accuracy,
   and maintains a robust performance by avoiding extreme errors.

AB CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome-editing technology that has been widely
   applied in targeted gene repair and gene expression regulation. One of
   the main challenges for the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the occurrence of
   unexpected cleavage at some sites (off-targets) and predicting them is
   necessary due to its relevance in gene editing research. Very few deep
   learning models have been developed so far to predict the off-target
   propensity of single guide RNA (sgRNA) at specific DNA fragments by
   using artificial feature extract operations and machine learning
   techniques; however, this is a convoluted process that is difficult to
   understand and implement for researchers. In this research work, we
   introduce a novel graph-based approach to predict off-target efficacy of
   sgRNA in the CRISPR/Cas9 system that is easy to understand and replicate
   for researchers. This is achieved by creating a graph with sequences as
   nodes and by using a link prediction method to predict the presence of
   links between sgRNA and off-target inducing target DNA sequences.
   Features for the sequences are extracted from within the sequences. We
   used HEK293 and K562 t datasets in our experiments. GCN predicted the
   off-target gene knockouts (using link prediction) by predicting the
   links between sgRNA and off-target sequences with an auROC value of
   0.987.

AB A cost-effective, scalable, eco-friendly, flexible smart apparel was
   fabricated by casting method employing polypyrrole(PPy) with
   biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol on cotton fabric. Different
   concentration of PPy is embedded in PVA. The X-ray diffraction pattern
   affirmed the interaction between PVA and PPy. Optical absorption spectra
   showed two peaks corresponding to PVA and the excitonic peak of PPy
   higher concentration of GCN exhibited a low bandgap harvesting the
   visible and IR part of the solar regime. High optical (0.104 S/cm) and
   electrical conductivity (2.3928 x 10-3) were attained for the higher
   concentration of PPy which might be attributed to the availability of
   the more defect centers in between the HUMO and LUMO of PVA. The room
   temperature photoluminescence exhibited enhanced blue emission at 379 nm
   for a higher concentration of PPy in PVA thin film due to the charge
   transfer mechanism. As 5PPy possesses, higher PL emission and higher
   electrical conductivity, it was taken further to fabricate smart apparel
   in cotton cloth. The fabricated smart apparels can be used to
   manufacture flexible, lightweight, eco-friendly optoelectronic devices.

AB In the context of low-carbon globalization, green development has become
   the common pursuit of all countries and the theme of China's development
   in the new era. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the main
   challenges affecting air quality, and how to accurately predict PM2.5
   plays a pivotal role in environmental governance. However, traditional
   data-driven approaches and deep learning methods for prediction rarely
   consider spatiotemporal features. Furthermore, different regions always
   have various implicit or hidden states, which have rarely been
   considered in the off-the-shelf model. To solve these problems, this
   study proposed a novel Spatial-Temporal Matrix Factorization Generative
   Adversarial Network (ST MFGAN) to capture spatiotemporal correlations
   and overcome the regional diversity problem at the same time.
   Specifically, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) composed of graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is
   used to generate a large amount of reliable spatiotemporal data, and
   matrix factorization network is used to decompose the vector output by
   GAN into multiple sub-networks. PM2.5 are finally combined and jointly
   predicted by the fusion layer. Extensive experiments show the
   superiority of the newly designed method.

AB Recognition of partial discharge (PD) patterns in gas insulated
   switchgear (GIS), as a basis of fault diagnosis, provides essential
   information for the condition assessment of GIS. However, traditional
   recognition methods are limited to handcrafted feature extraction or are
   extremely sensitive to the quantity and quality of datasets. Therefore,
   this article proposes a knowledge-driven algorithm, composed of the
   feature space and the knowledge space, to automatically extract PD
   features and improve the performance on noised, insufficient, and
   imbalanced datasets. First, the deep residual network (ResNet) in
   feature space extracts features from raw signals. Second, in knowledge
   space, the graph convolutional network (GCN) extracts additional
   information from the knowledge graph, which compensates for the missing
   information of original datasets. Finally, the algorithm recognizes
   patterns by ranking similarities between feature vectors and knowledge
   vectors. Verified by the comparison experiment, the proposed algorithm
   outperforms traditional methods with the accuracy of 99.58% on the
   experimental dataset and 95.67% on the online-detected dataset.
   Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm achieves 88.79% and
   7037% on noised and insufficient datasets, respectively, while the
   F-measure is higher than those of the comparison methods by 12.95%
   similar to 18.69% on imbalanced datasets.

AB Multi-topic sentiment analysis, which aims to identify the topics and
   classify their corre-sponding sentiment, is of great value in
   understanding consumers' behaviour and improv-ing services. Because of
   the high cost of manual annotation of the datasets, topic model -based
   approaches that model the joint distributions of both topics and
   sentiments have been studied previously. Some studies proposed models
   that leverage the prior knowledge derived from the pre-trained word
   embeddings and have proven effective. However, most of the existing
   models are based on the assumption that words and topics are
   conditionally independent, ignoring the dependency relations among them.
   Additionally, the fine-tuning of the pre-trained word embeddings to
   incorporate the contextual information is also neglected in these
   models. This could result in the ambiguous representations of topics. In
   this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised graph-based joint
   sentiment topic model (W-GJST) that integrates an edge-gated graph
   convolutional network (E-GCN) into a joint sentiment-topic model. An
   importance sampling-based training method is proposed to learn the
   contextual representations of topics and words efficiently.
   Additionally, a self -training multi-topic classifier is designed for
   the multi-label topic identification. Experiments on two benchmark
   datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed W-GJST compared to
   the baseline models in terms of topic modelling, topic identification
   and topic-sentiment identification. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Cu catalysts with different defect types are widely applied in CO2
   activation and conversion, however, the underlying role of Cu surface
   defect types in tuning the activity and selectivity is still unclear due
   to the complexity of surface defect types. This work constructed a
   series of Cu catalysts including the perfect surface, as well as the
   point and line defect surfaces to reveal the role of Cu surface defect
   types on CO2 activation and conversion using theoretical calculations.
   The results show that Cu defect types can effectively tune the activity
   and selectivity of CO2 activation and conversion; the line defect Cu
   surfaces have higher CO2 activation activity than the point defect and
   perfect surfaces. Both the line defect Cu(111)(LD) and (511)(LD)
   surfaces are screened out to present the highest activity toward C-1 and
   C-2 species formation, respectively. Moreover, Cu surfaces with
   different defects present an inverted volcano-type curve between d-band
   center and CO2 activation activity, both Cu(111)(LD) and (511)(LD) with
   excellent activity are attributed to the moderate d-band center.
   Further, the generalized coordination number (GCN) of Cu surface is
   proposed and confirmed as an effective descriptor to predict the
   activity of CO2 activation on different Cu surfaces. The results can
   provide the valuable structural information for the design and
   prediction of Cu catalysts with excellent activity and selectivity in
   CO2 activation and conversion.

AB Luminal A is the most common breast cancer molecular subtype in women
   worldwide. These tumors have characteristic yet heterogeneous
   alterations at the genomic and transcriptomic level. Gene co-expression
   networks (GCNs) have contributed to better characterize the cancerous
   phenotype. We have previously shown an imbalance in the proportion of
   intra-chromosomal (cis-) over inter-chromosomal (trans-) interactions
   when comparing cancer and healthy tissue GCNs. In particular, for breast
   cancer molecular subtypes (Luminal A included), the majority of high
   co-expression interactions connect gene-pairs in the same chromosome, a
   phenomenon that we have called loss of trans- co-expression. Despite
   this phenomenon has been described, the functional implication of this
   specific network topology has not been studied yet. To understand the
   biological role that communities of co-expressed genes may have, we
   constructed GCNs for healthy and Luminal A phenotypes. Network modules
   were obtained based on their connectivity patterns and they were
   classified according to their chromosomal homophily (proportion of
   cis-/trans- interactions). A functional overrepresentation analysis was
   performed on communities in both networks to observe the significantly
   enriched processes for each community. We also investigated possible
   mechanisms for which the loss of trans- co-expression emerges in cancer
   GCN. To this end we evaluated transcription factor binding sites, CTCF
   binding sites, differential gene expression and copy number alterations
   (CNAs) in the cancer GCN. We found that trans- communities in Luminal A
   present more significantly enriched categories than cis- ones.
   Processes, such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, or cell adhesion
   were found in trans- modules. The differential expression analysis
   showed that FOXM1, CENPA, and CIITA transcription factors, exert a major
   regulatory role on their communities by regulating expression of their
   target genes in other chromosomes. Finally, identification of CNAs,
   displayed a high enrichment of deletion peaks in cis- communities. With
   this approach, we demonstrate that network topology determine, to at
   certain extent, the function in Luminal A breast cancer network.
   Furthermore, several mechanisms seem to be acting together to avoid
   trans- co-expression. Since this phenomenon has been observed in other
   cancer tissues, a remaining question is whether the loss of long
   distance co-expression is a novel hallmark of cancer.

AB Despite the great promise of the physics-informed neural networks
   (PINNs) in solving forward and inverse problems, several technical
   challenges are present as roadblocks for more complex and realistic
   applications. First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise
   formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions,
   which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement.
   Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex
   optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional
   neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve
   training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with
   unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a
   novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN)
   and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial
   differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a
   piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and
   facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty
   parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose
   boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and
   inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular
   geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the
   proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse
   computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear
   PDEs.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and graph representation learning are
   two common methods for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.
   Recently, graph convolutional neural networks, a combination of CNN and
   graph representation learning, have shown great potential in the HSI
   classification problem. However, the existing graph convolution network
   (GCN)-based methods have many problems, such as overdependence on the
   adjacency matrix, usage of a single modal feature, and lower accuracy
   than the mature CNN method. In this article, we propose a feature fusion
   hypergraph neural network ((FHNN)-H-2) for HSI classification.
   (FHNN)-H-2 first generates hyperedges from features of different
   modalities to construct a hypergraph representing multimodal features in
   HSI. Then, the HSI and the extracted hypergraph are input into the
   hypergraph convolutional neural network for learning. In addition, we
   propose three feature fusion strategies. The first strategy is the most
   basic spatial and spectral feature fusion. The second strategy fuses the
   spectral features extracted by a pretrained multilayer perceptron (MLP)
   with the spatial features to reduce the redundant information of the
   original spectral features. The third strategy uses the fusion of CNN
   features, spectral features, and spatial features to explore the
   capabilities of (FHNN)-H-2. Sufficient experiments on four datasets have
   proved the effectiveness of (FHNN)-H-2.

AB Partial label learning (PLL) is a weakly supervised learning framework
   where each training instance is associated with more than one candidate
   label, and only one of them is the true label. Most of the existing PLL
   algorithms directly disambiguate the candidate labels according to the
   instance feature sim-ilarity, but fail to discover the latent semantic
   relationship over the entire dataset. In this paper, method GraphDPI, an
   innovative deep partial label disambiguation by graph representation via
   mutual information maximization , is proposed. This method can capture
   the semantic clusters with the most unique infor-mation in the latent
   space and automatically adapt to different feature distributions.
   Specifically, a new sampling method based on the graph is proposed to
   estimate mutual information, extending GCN to the field of weakly
   supervised learning. Therefore, the graph representation of the data can
   contain more distinguishing information to disambiguate candidate labels
   by maximizing the mutual information of the local graph representation
   and the global one. Furthermore, the triplet loss is introduced to fully
   ex-ploit the relationship between instances and extract the latent
   embedding representation over the entire dataset. It thereby can make
   the model output as large as possible on the inter-class variation and
   as small as possible on the intra-class variation. Finally, the
   candidate labels can be disambiguated by the difference between semantic
   clusters. Experiments reveal the overwhelming performances of
   GraphDPI.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Complex and diverse microbial communities have certain impacts on human
   health, and specific drugs are needed to treat diseases caused by
   microbes. However, most of the discovery of associations between
   microbes and drugs is through biological experiments, which are
   time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an
   effective and computational model to detect novel microbe-drug
   associations. In this study, we propose a model based on Multiple Kernel
   fusion on Graph Convolutional Network, called MKGCN, for inferring novel
   microbe-drug associations. Our model is built on the heterogeneous
   network of microbes and drugs to extract multi-layer features, through
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Then, we respectively calculate the
   kernel matrix by embedding features on each layer, and fuse multiple
   kernel matrices based on the average weighting method. Finally, Dual
   Laplacian Regularized Least Squares is used to infer new microbe-drug
   associations by the combined kernel in microbe and drug spaces. Compared
   with the existing tools for detecting biological bipartite networks, our
   model has excellent prediction effect on three datasets via three types
   of cross-validation. Furthermore, we also conduct a case study of the
   SARS-Cov-2 virus and make a deduction about drugs that may be able to
   associate with COVID-19. We have proved the accuracy of the prediction
   results through the existing literature.

AB Graph clustering based on embedding aims to divide nodes with higher
   similarity into several mutually disjoint groups, but it is not a
   trivial task to maximumly embed the graph structure and node attributes
   into the low dimensional feature space. Furthermore, most of the current
   advanced methods of graph nodes clustering adopt the strategy of
   separating graph embedding technology and clustering algorithm, and
   ignore the potential relationship between them. Therefore, we propose an
   innovative end to-end graph clustering framework with joint strategy to
   handle the complex problem in a non-Euclidean space. In terms of
   learning the graph embedding, we propose a new variational graph
   auto-encoder algorithm based on the Graph Convolution Network (GCN),
   which takes into account the boosting influence of joint generative
   model of graph structure and node attributes on the embedding output. On
   the basis of embedding representation, we implement a self-training
   mechanism through the construction of auxiliary distribution to further
   enhance the prediction of node categories, thereby realizing the
   unsupervised clustering mode. In addition, the loss contribution of each
   cluster is normalized to prevent large clusters from distorting the
   embedding space. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets
   validate our design and demonstrate that our algorithm has highly
   competitive in graph clustering over state-of-theart methods. (c) 2021

AB We propose a spherical kernel for efficient graph convolution of 3D
   point clouds. Our metric-based kernels systematically quantize the local
   3D space to identify distinctive geometric relationships in the data.
   Similar to the regular grid CNN kernels, the spherical kernel maintains
   translation-invariance and asymmetry properties, where the former
   guarantees weight sharing among similar local structures in the data and
   the latter facilitates fine geometric learning. The proposed kernel is
   applied to graph neural networks without edge-dependent filter
   generation, making it computationally attractive for large point clouds.
   In our graph networks, each vertex is associated with a single point
   location and edges connect the neighborhood points within a defined
   range. The graph gets coarsened in the network with farthest point
   sampling. Analogous to the standard CNNs, we define pooling and
   unpooling operations for our network. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed spherical kernel with graph neural networks for point
   cloud classification and semantic segmentation using ModelNet, ShapeNet,
   RueMonge2014, ScanNet and S3DIS datasets. The source code and the
   trained models can be downloaded from

AB Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention for its ubiquitous
   real-life applications in traffic management, urban computing, public
   safety, and so on. Recently, the availability of massive trajectory data
   and the success of deep learning motivate a plethora of deep traffic
   prediction studies. However, the existing neural-network-based
   approaches tend to ignore the correlations between multiple types of
   moving objects located in the same spatio-temporal traffic area, which
   is suboptimal for traffic prediction analytics.
   In this paper, we propose a multi-source deep traffic prediction
   framework over spatio-temporal trajectory data, termed as MDTP. The
   framework includes two phases: spatio-temporal feature modeling and
   multi-source bridging. We present an enhanced graph convolutional
   network (GCN) model combined with long short-term memory network (LSTM)
   to capture the spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics of traffic in
   the feature modeling phase. In the multi-source bridging phase, we
   propose two methods, Sum and Concat, to connect the learned features
   from different trajectory data sources. Extensive experiments on two
   real-life datasets show that MDTP i) has superior efficiency, compared
   with classical time-series methods, machine learning methods, and
   state-of-the-art neural-network-based approaches; ii) offers a
   significant performance improvement over the single-source traffic
   prediction approach; and iii) performs traffic predictions in seconds
   even on tens of millions of trajectory data. we develop MDTP+, a
   user-friendly interactive system to demonstrate traffic prediction
   analysis.

AB In this work, we benchmark a variety of single- and multi-task graph
   neural network (GNN) models against lower-bar and higher-bar traditional
   machine learning approaches employing human engineered molecular
   features. We consider four GNN variants - Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), Message Passing Neural Network
   (MPNN), and Attentive Fingerprint (AttentiveFP). So far deep learning
   models have been primarily benchmarked using lower-bar traditional
   models solely based on fingerprints, while more realistic benchmarks
   employing fingerprints, whole-molecule descriptors and predictions from
   other related endpoints (e. g., LogD7.4) appear to be scarce for
   industrial ADME datasets. In addition to time-split test sets based on
   Genentech data, this study benefits from the availability of
   measurements from an external chemical space (Roche data). We identify
   GAT as a promising approach to implementing deep learning models. While
   all the deep learning models significantly outperform lower-bar
   benchmark traditional models solely based on fingerprints, only GATs
   seem to offer a small but consistent improvement over higher-bar
   benchmark traditional models. Finally, the accuracy of in vitro assays
   from different laboratories predicting the same experimental endpoints
   appears to be comparable with the accuracy of GAT single-task models,
   suggesting that most of the observed error from the models is a function
   of the experimental error propagation.

AB As urban traffic pollution continues to increase, there is an urgent
   need to build traffic emission monitoring and forecasting system for the
   urban traffic construction. The traffic emission monitoring and
   forecasting system's core is the prediction of traffic emission's
   evolution. And the traffic flow prediction on the urban road network
   contributes greatly to the prediction of traffic emission's evolution.
   Due to the complex non-Euclidean topological structure of traffic
   networks and dynamic heterogeneous spatial-temporal correlations of
   traffic conditions, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory prediction
   results with less computation cost. To figure these issues out, a novel
   deep learning traffic flow forecasting framework is proposed in this
   paper, termed as Ensemble Attention based Graph Time Convolutional
   Networks (EAGTCN). More specifically, each component of our model
   contains two major blocks: (1) the global spatial patterns are captured
   by the spatial blocks which are fused by the Graph Convolution Network
   (GCN) and spatial ensemble attention layer; (2) the temporal patterns
   are captured by the temporal blocks which are composed by the Time
   Convolution Net (TCN) and temporal ensemble attention layers.
   Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model
   obtains more accurate prediction results than the state-of-the-art
   baselines at less computation expense especially in the long-term
   prediction situation.

AB Intelligent fault diagnosis has made significant progress, thanks to
   machine learning, particularly deep-learning algorithms. However, most
   machine-learning algorithms treat samples as independent and ignore the
   correlations between samples that contain valuable information for
   creating discriminative features. In recent years, graph neural networks
   have increased diagnostic performance by capturing the correlation
   between samples according to establishing the inherent structure of
   data, but they also suffer from two shortcomings. First, a simple graph
   only represents pairwise relationships of samples and cannot depict
   complex higher-order structures. Second, the generated graph structure
   is insufficient to characterize the data without an explicit structure.
   To address the above two issues, this article proposes a multiresolution
   hypergraph neural network, a novel algorithm that can discover
   higher-order complex relationships between samples, and mine the
   structure hidden in data by establishing and fusing hypergraph
   structures at multiple resolutions. Experiments are conducted on three
   datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) build on the success of deep learning
   models by extending them for use in graph spaces. Transfer learning has
   proven extremely successful for traditional deep learning problems,
   resulting in faster training and improved performance. Despite the
   increasing interest in GNNs and their use cases, there is little
   research on their transferability. This research demonstrates that
   transfer learning is effective with GNNs, and describes how source tasks
   and the choice of GNN impact the ability to learn generalisable
   knowledge. We perform experiments using real-world and synthetic data
   within the contexts of node classification and graph classification. To
   this end, we also provide a general methodology for transfer learning
   experimentation and present a novel algorithm for generating synthetic
   graph classification tasks. We compare the performance of GCN, GraphSAGE
   and GIN across both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results
   demonstrate empirically that GNNs with inductive operations yield
   statistically significantly improved transfer. Further, we show that
   similarity in community structure between source and target tasks
   support statistically significant improvements in transfer over and
   above the use of only the node attributes.

AB Recent advances on aerial image semantic segmentation mainly employ the
   domain adaption to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the
   target domain. Despite the remarkable achievement, most methods focus on
   the global marginal distribution alignment to reduce the domain shift
   between source and target domains, leading to a wrong mapping of the
   well-aligned features. In this article, we propose an effective
   unsupervised domain adaptation approach, which relies on a novel entropy
   guided adversarial learning algorithm, for aerial image semantic
   segmentation. In specific, we perform local feature alignment between
   domains by learning a self-adaptive weight from the target prediction
   probability map to measure the interdomain discrepancy. To exploit the
   meaningful structure information among semantic regions, we propose to
   utilize the graph convolutions for long-range semantic reasoning.
   Comprehensive experimental results on the benchmark dataset of aerial
   image semantic segmentation and natural scenes demonstrate the superior
   performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art
   methods.

   existing works adopted RNN and CNN/GCN, among which GCRN is the
   state-of-the-art work, to characterize the temporal and spatial
   correlation of traffic flows. However, it is hard to apply GCRN to the
   large-scale road networks due to high computational complexity. To
   address this problem, we propose abstracting the road network into a
   geometric graph and building a Fast Graph Convolution Recurrent Neural
   Network (FastGCRNN) to model the spatial-temporal dependencies of
   traffic flow. Specifically, we use FastGCN unit to efficiently capture
   the topological relationship between the roads and the surrounding roads
   in the graph with reducing the computational complexity through
   importance sampling, combine GRU unit to capture the temporal dependency
   of traffic flow, and embed the spatiotemporal features into Seq2Seq
   based on the Encoder-Decoder framework. Experiments on large-scale
   traffic data sets illustrate that the proposed method can greatly reduce
   computational complexity and memory consumption while maintaining
   relatively high accuracy.

AB The development of social media has caused a boom in information
   sharing, but it also provides an ideal platform for publishing and
   spreading rumors. On social media platforms, there are a lot of
   comments, which contain the user's most direct views and reactions to
   the post. They can be utilized as clues to detect rumors. Recently, some
   methods are proposed to detect rumors through post and comments which
   usually focus on content information. However, except for this, other
   information such as reply structure, mutual selection information
   between post and comments, topic drift within comments also can help
   detect rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel model, PostCom2DR, for
   rumor detection. In PostCom2DR, a reply graph between post and comments
   is first created. Then a bilevel GCN and self-attention mechanism are
   built to learn the representation of comments. Secondly, a post-comment
   co-attention mechanism is introduced to selectively fuse information,
   and this helps the model focus on more relevant information. Through the
   above modules, we can get the global representation of post and
   comments. In addition, a 1D CNN is built to capture the local topic
   drift on time series inside the comments. Finally, we concatenate the
   global representation and local representation for rumor detection.
   Extensive experiments conducted on Chinese and English datasets show
   that PostCom2DR significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models
   on both rumor detection and early detection.

AB Graph convolutional neural networks have established significant success
   in solving various machine learning and computer vision problems. For
   skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional neural networks
   are the most suitable choice since human skeleton resembles to a graph.
   Stacking body skeletons over the length of video sequence results in a
   very complex spatio-temporal graph of many nodes and edges. Modeling the
   graph convolutional network directly with such a complex graph curtails
   the performance due to the redundancy of insignificant nodes and edges
   in the graph. Also for skeleton based action recognition, the long-term
   contextual information is of central importance and many current
   architectures may fail to capture such contextual information. Therefore
   in order to alleviate these problems, we propose graph sparsification
   technique using edge effective resistance to better model the global
   context information and to eliminate redundant nodes and edges in the
   graph. Furthermore, we incorporate self-attention graph pooling to
   retain local properties and graph structures while pooling operation. To
   the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply graph
   sparsification using edge effective resistance for skeleton-based action
   recognition and our proposed method is confirmed to be effective on
   action recognition, which achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly
   available datasets: UTD-MHAD, J-HMDB, NTU-RGB + D-60, NTU-RGB + D-120

AB The vehicle HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) system
   aims to keep passengers thermal comfort and reduce energy consumption.
   One effective measure is to use temperature prediction to optimize HVAC
   systems. This paper aimed to comprehensively investigate the potential
   of machine learning methods applied to cockpit temperature prediction
   and proposed a deep learning method considering the Spatio-temporal
   correlation of the temperature field. Specifically, this study
   constructs a topological description of the temperature field inspired
   by the spatial and temporal correlations revealed by the Navier-Stokes
   equations. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to capture the
   topological structure to obtain spatial features, and the Gated
   Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to capture the dynamic change of node
   attribute to obtain temporal features. Finally, the GCGRU model can
   extract Spatiotemporal features of the temperature field. The
   experimental results show that the prediction method using
   Spatio-temporal features for the temperature field is feasible. The
   prediction performance is better than all the baseline methods and has
   the robustness to the data noise. This work is enlightening and may have
   a further reference to the feasibility study of the vehicle cabin air

AB Choosing useful indexes for a relational database is important for
   efficient query optimiza-tion. However, current methods tend to use the
   cost estimated by the optimizer in the database management system (DBMS)
   to measure the benefits of the index and, due to inaccurate cost
   estimates, do not bring to the most optimal solution. In addition,
   existing reinforcement learning methods treat the creation of different
   indexes as independent actions, ignoring the relationships among
   indexes, which may bring to unnecessary train-ing costs. To address
   these problems, we propose DeepIndex, an automatic index selector with a
   learning-based cost estimator to improve the quality of index selection.
   To accu-rately estimate the benefit of an index, we design a
   learning-based cost estimator to predict the execution time of queries
   on certain indexes. In particular, we treat query plans as graphs and
   develop a model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn
   features from queries and indexes. After that, we design a
   reinforcement-learning-based index selection model considering the
   relationships among indexes and combine our cost estima-tor to select
   indexes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark workloads JOB and TPC-DS
   show that our model performs better than state-of-the-art models with
   the lowest storage costs, and our lowest relative execution cost
   outperforms the baselines by 38.59% on JOB and 10.42% on TPC-DS.(c) 2022

AB We present a Multi-actor Activity Detection Framework (MADF) to model
   the interactive relationship among multiple actors for activity
   detection in extended videos. MADF can detect 3 groups of multi-actor
   activities with different kinds of actors, which involves three stages:
   detection, classification and post-processing. In the detection stage,
   both interaction proposals and actor proposals are generated in each
   video clip, in order to eliminate irrelevant background in the scene. In
   the classification stage, 3 different classification networks are
   proposed to classify the 3 groups of activities. And further, for
   person-object interaction, an attention mechanism is adopted to help the
   person-object classification network to pay more attention to the
   small-scale objects; for person-person interaction, a suppression module
   is used to improve the accuracy of the person-person activity detection;
   for person-vehicle interaction, a spatial-temporal graph convolution
   network (GCN) module is embedded to model the fine-grained relationship
   between the person and vehicle in the person-vehicle classification
   network, with a proposed Mutually Exclusive Category Loss (MECLoss)
   helping this network distinguish mutually exclusive activities. At last,
   we use the off-the-shelf post-processing methods to re-score the
   proposals for more stable results. The proposed system achieves a great
   progress on our baseline and achieves the state-of-the-art results in

AB Cross-media association mining based on heterogeneous information
   network(HIN) has received widespread attention. However, video is
   described by only a few words, leading to the lack of association
   between visual and textual information. As a result, the heterogeneous
   graph is inevitably incomplete, which brings great challenges to event
   mining. Fortunately, topological relationships can infer correlations
   between similar nodes. In view of this, a novel framework of web video
   event mining based on attention graph structure learning is proposed to
   generate a new adjacency matrix, which reconstructs the association
   among nodes. First, a novel heterogeneous network is constructed, while
   each relation subgraph is produced separately. Then, in each relational
   subgraph, feature graphs are generated by feature similarity, which can
   capture potential relationships between nodes. Simultaneously, semantic
   graph is also created by learning semantic structures to describe
   complex heterogeneous interactions between node semantics. Next, these
   graphs are fused by channel attention to reconstruct the correlation
   among nodes. Finally, graph convolutional network(GCN) is applied for
   web video event mining. Experiments on web videos from YouTube
   demonstrate that our proposed method is more effective than the
   state-of-the-art methods with significant improvement. (C) 2022

AB Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuels is recognized as a favorable
   solution to solve the energy crisis and greenhouse effect
   simultaneously. Herein, to improve the photoreduction efficiency of CO2,
   a direct Z-scheme NiTiO3/g-C3N4 (NT/GCN) photocatalyst is constructed by
   a facile calcination method. The highest yield of CH3OH
   (13.74.mol.g(-1).h(-1)) can be obtained at the optimized NT/GCN40
   without any sacrificial agent and cocatalyst, almost 3.29 times higher
   compared with g-C3N4. Simultaneously, mechanism study by the band
   potential estimation and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis provide
   evidences that the enhanced photoactivity is ascribed to the Z-scheme.
   This unique structure can enhance the spatial separation of
   hole-electron pairs, suppress the recombination of charge carriers and
   remain the strong redox ability. Moreover, this direct Z-scheme NT/GCN40
   composite shows good reusability. This work may present a novel way for
   the design and manufacture of Z-scheme photocatalysts for energy
   conversion and environmental remediation.

AB Herein, a novel composite photocatalyst was prepared by the vapor
   deposition of g-C3N4 on TiO2 nanosquare, dominated with {001} facets.
   The deposition method is robust, convenient, and effective. The surface
   topography and structure of the composites were analyzed by XRD, XPS,
   SEM, and TEM. The mechanism for enhanced photocatalysis was studied
   using PL, PC, UV-vis-NIR-DRS, TRPL, EIS and EPR. The photocatalytic
   activities of the fabricated composites were evaluated by the
   degradation of methylene blue (MB) and hexavalent chromium ions (Cr6+)
   under visible light irradiation. The photodegradation of MB and Cr6+ was
   completed in 50 and 40 min, respectively. Based on a pseudo-first-order
   kinetic model (ln(C-0/C) = kt), the measured the degradation rate
   constant for MB using gCN/TO5 was 4.6 and 35.9 times higher than that of
   pure g-C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. Similar results were found for the
   Cr6+ degradation. The outstanding photocatalytic performance of the
   g-C3N4 on TiO2 composite was ascribed to the presence of the TiO2/g-C3N4
   heterojunctions, which effectively improved the separation of the
   photoexcited electrons and holes hence the enhancement of visible-light
   photoactivity. Overall, this work showed a convenient and efficient
   method for fabricating the visible light photocatalysts with established
   possible mechanisms for the photoactivity of the hybrid photocatalytic
   composite material.

AB The human cerebral cortex is folded into two fundamentally anatomical
   units: gyri and sulci. Previous studies have demonstrated the genetical,
   structural, and functional differences between gyri and sulci, providing
   a unique perspective for revealing the relationship among brain
   function, cognition, and behavior. While previous studies mainly focus
   on the functional differences between gyri and sulci under resting or
   task-evoked state, such characteristics under naturalistic stimulus (NS)
   which reflects real-world dynamic environments are largely unknown. To
   address this question, this study systematically investigates
   spatio-temporal functional connectivity (FC) characteristics between
   gyri and sulci under NS using a spatio-temporal graph convolutional
   network model. Based on the public Human Connectome Project dataset of
   174 subjects with four different runs of both movie-watching NS and
   resting state 7T functional MRI data, we successfully identify unique FC
   features under NS, which are mainly involved in visual, auditory,
   emotional and cognitive control, and achieve high discriminative
   accuracy 93.06 % to resting state. Moreover, gyral regions as well as
   gyro-gyral connections consistently participate more as functional
   information exchange hubs than sulcal ones among these networks. This
   study provides novel insights into the functional brain mechanism under
   NS and lays a solid foundation for accurately mapping the brain
   anatomy-function relationship.

AB Monocular depth estimation is a foundation task of three-dimensional
   (3D) reconstruction which is used to improve the accuracy of environment
   perception. Because of the simpler hardware requirement, it is more
   suitable than other multi-view methods. In this study, a new monocular
   depth estimation algorithm based on graph convolution network (GCN) is
   proposed. The pixel-wise depth relationship is introduced into
   conventional convolution neural network (CNN) to make up the
   disadvantage of processing non-Euclidian data. And the remaining depth
   topological graph information on the spatial latent variables are
   extracted based on a multi-scale reconstruction strategy. The final
   results on NYU-v2 depth dataset and KITTI depth dataset demonstrate that
   our algorithm improves the quality of monocular depth estimation,
   especially there are several little objects coexisting in the scenes.

AB In joint entity and relation extraction, the input document is divided
   into multiple potential entity regions and context regions, where the
   characteristics of entities and their relations can often be reflected
   in the context. Therefore, an effective joint modeling method designed
   toward the features of different regions can lead to superior
   performance of joint entity and relation extraction. Previous works tend
   to implement in-depth modeling only for potential entity regions,
   ignoring the importance of contextual information for joint entity and
   relation extraction. In this paper, we propose a Region-based Hypergraph
   Network (RHGN) for joint entity and relation extraction. The RHGN
   introduces the concept of regional hypernodes for the first time, and
   proposes a cooperative method of GCN and BiLSTM to generate hypernodes
   for each region. Then, a region-based relation hypergraph is constructed
   for fairly and efficiently aggregate the features of all regions in the
   sentence. In order to initialize and update the features of the edges
   and hypernodes in the hypergraph, a Sequence-Enhanced Graph (SEG) unit
   is designed. Finally, we perform comparison experiments with existing
   competitive models on three public datasets: the CoNLL04, SciERC and ADE
   datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a
   significant improvement over the previous models on both entity
   recognition and relation extraction, and it also shows superior
   performance for dataset with nested entities. Extensive additional
   experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2021

AB In recent years, object detection has shown excellent results on a large
   number of annotated data, but when there is a discrepancy between the
   annotated data and the real test data, the performance of the trained
   object detection model is often degraded when it is directly transferred
   to the real test dataset. Compared with natural images, remote sensing
   images have great differences in appearance and quality. Traditional
   methods need to re-label all image data before interpretation, which
   will consume a lot of manpower and time. Therefore, it is of practical
   significance to study the Cross-Domain Adaptation Object Detection
   (CDAOD) of remote sensing images. To solve the above problems, our paper
   proposes a Rotation-Invariant and Relation-Aware (RIRA) CDAOD network.
   We trained the network at the image-level and the prototype-level based
   on a relation aware graph to align the feature distribution and added
   the rotation-invariant regularizer to deal with the rotation diversity.
   The Faster R-CNN network was adopted as the backbone framework of the
   network. We conducted experiments on two typical remote sensing building
   detection datasets, and set three domain adaptation scenarios: WHU 2012
   -> WHU 2016, Inria (Chicago) -> Inria (Austin), and WHU 2012 -> Inria
   (Austin). The results show that our method can effectively improve the
   detection effect in the target domain, and outperform competing methods
   by obtaining optimal results in all three scenarios.

AB Citation recommendation is an effective and efficient way to facilitate
   authors finding desired references. This paper presents a novel neural
   network based model, called gated relational probabilistic stacked
   denoising autoencoder with localized author (GRSLA) embedding, for
   global citation recommendation task. Our model is comprised of two
   modules with different neural network architecture. For each citing and
   cited papers, we use a gated paper embedding module, which is extended
   from probabilistic stacked denoising autoencoder (PSDAE) by adding gated
   units, to obtain their paper vectors. The added gated units are able to
   utilize text information of cited paper to refine the vector
   representation of citing paper in multiple semantic levels. For an
   author in papers, we first apply topic model to obtain his/her semantic
   neighbors, and then use a localized author embedding (LAE) module to
   excavate author vector representation from semantic and explicit
   neighbors. Unlike most graph convolutional network (GCN) based methods,
   the LAE module is able to avoid computing global Laplacian in whole
   graph by taking limited neighbors. Moreover, the LAE module can also be
   stacked to absorb more neighbors, which makes our model have high
   extendibility. Based on the generation process of GRSLA, we also derive
   a learning algorithm of our model by maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   estimation. We conduct experiments on the AAN, DBLP and CORD-19
   datasets, and the results show that GRSLA model works well than previous
   global citation recommendation methods.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim to make transportation
   smarter, safer, reliable, and environmentally friendly without
   detrimentally affecting the service quality. ITS can face security
   issues due to their complex, dynamic, and non-linear properties. One of
   the most critical security problems is attacks that damage the
   infrastructure of the entire ITS. Attackers can inject malware code that
   triggers dangerous actions such as information theft and unwanted system
   moves. The main objective of this study is to improve the performance of
   malware detection models using Graph Attention Networks. To detect
   malware attacks addressing ITS, a Graph Attention Network (GAN)-based
   framework is proposed in this study. The inputs to this framework are
   the Application Programming Interface (API)-call graphs obtained from
   malware and benign Android apk files. During the graph creation, network
   metrics and the Node2Vec model are utilized to generate the node
   features. A GAN-based model is combined with different types of node
   features during the experiments and the performance is compared against
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Experimental results demonstrated
   that the integration of the GAN and Node2Vec models provides the best
   performance in terms of F-measure and accuracy parameters and, also, the
   use of an attention mechanism in GAN improves the performance.
   Furthermore, node features generated with Node2Vec resulted in a 3%
   increase in classification accuracy compared to the features generated
   with network metrics.</p>

AB Ab initio studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrogen
   storage by Mg decorated graphite carbon nitride (g-CN, heptazine
   structure). In our calculations, we found that each unit of this
   material can accommodate one Mg atom. Partial charges from Mg were
   transferred to the pristine material, making itself more
   electropositive. This is favorable for hydrogen storage, as the adsorbed
   H-2 molecules can be easily polarized, and the electrostatic
   interactions can be enhanced. The configurations of the Mg-decorated gCN
   with multiple adsorbed H-2 molecules were presented in this study, and
   the related adsorption mechanisms were also discussed in details. Each
   unit can adsorb at most 7 H-2 molecules with adsorption energies ranging
   from-0.276 eV to-0.130 eV. In addition, besides Mg, we also noticed that
   the nitrogen atoms also perform well in hydrogen adsorption. For this
   novel material, its highest capacity of hydrogen storage can reach to
   7.8 wt%, highly surpassing the target value of 5.5 wt% set by the U.S.
   department of energy (DOE)[1]. The computational results provided in
   this study indicates a promising prospect for alkali metal
   functionalized 2D materials in energy storage; and through decent explo-
   rations, the performance of this class of materials can be largely
   improved. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important index to detect ocean
   changes, predict SST anomalies, and prevent natural disasters caused by
   abnormal changes, dynamic variation of which have a profound impact on
   the whole marine ecosystem and the dynamic changes of climate. In order
   to better capture the dynamic changes of ocean temperature, it's vitally
   essential to predict the SST in the future. A new spatio-temporal
   attention graph convolutional network (STAGCN) for SST prediction was
   proposed in this paper which can capture spatial dependence and temporal
   correlation in the way of integrating gated recurrent unit (GRU) model
   with graph convolutional network (GCN) and introduced attention
   mechanism. The STAGCN model adopts the GCN model to learn the
   topological structure between ocean location points for extracting the
   spatial characteristics from the ocean position nodes network. Besides,
   capturing temporal correlation by learning dynamic variation of SST time
   series data, a GRU model is introduced into the STAGCN model to deal
   with the prediction problem about long time series, the input of which
   is the SST data with spatial characteristics. To capture the
   significance of SST information at different times and increase the
   accuracy of SST forecast, the attention mechanism was used to obtain the
   spatial and temporal characteristics globally. In this study, the
   proposed STAGCN model was trained and tested on the East China
   Sea.Experiments with different prediction lengths show that the model
   can capture the spatio-temporal correlation of regional-scale sea
   surface temperature series and almost uniformly outperforms other
   classical models under different sea areas and different prediction
   levels, in which the root mean square error is reduced by about 0.2
   compared with the LSTM model.

AB Fault diagnosis for rolling bearings has been an important engineering
   problem for decades. To detect the damaged bearing surface, engineers
   analyze the features from the extracted vibration signals of the
   machine. As artificial intelligence rapidly develops and provides
   favorable effects in data analytics, using deep-learning technology to
   attack fault diagnosis problems has attracted increasing research
   interest in recent years. However, most existing methods do not provide
   satisfactory performance in mining the relationship between the signals.
   Even graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can perform well in
   non-Euclidean spaces have limitations, since it only considers
   extracting features from a single scale, ignoring the potential
   relationship between signals at various scales. For salvation, we
   propose a multiscale graph convolutional network (MS-GCN) for this
   specific problem. In MS-GCN, we put forward a multiscale feature
   extraction module, which extracts the features of vibration signals two
   times under diverse receptive field ranges, ensuring that the
   regularities of signal features can be fully discovered. In addition, we
   devise a multiscale graph iteration module, which incorporates two
   single-scale graph iteration modules and a cross-scale graph iteration
   module, which can fully retain local features based on extensive mining
   of global information. We also propose a mutual fusion module based on
   the Bayesian method, which forcibly manipulates various features as a
   prior and achieves a convincing result. The horizontal visibility graph
   (HVG) method is used to construct graph models at multiple scales, which
   can better capture the hidden information of signal vibrations. In
   experiments, we verify the proposed model on the CWRU dataset to
   evaluate the method's performance. The results show that our model
   significantly improved accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art
   methods.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant progress in
   the field of cloud detection in remote sensing images thanks to their
   powerful feature representation capabilities. Existing methods typically
   aggregate low-level features containing details and high-level features
   containing semantics to make full use of both features to accurately
   detect cloud regions. However, CNNs are still limited in their ability
   to reason about the relationships between features, while not being able
   to model context well. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a
   novel feature interaction graph convolutional network model that extends
   the feature fusion process of convolutional neural networks from
   Euclidean space to non-Euclidean space. The algorithm consists of three
   main components: remote sensing image feature extraction, feature
   interaction graph reasoning, and high-resolution feature recovery. The
   algorithm constructs a feature interaction graph reasoning (FIGR) module
   to fully interact with low-level and high-level features and then uses a
   residual graph convolutional network to infer feature higher-order
   relationships. The network model effectively alleviates the problem of a
   semantic divide in the feature fusion process, allowing the aggregated
   features to fuse valuable details and semantic information. The
   algorithm is designed to better detect clouds with complex cloud layers
   in remote sensing images with complex cloud shape, size, thickness, and
   cloud-snow coexistence. Validated on publicly available 38-Cloud and
   SPARCS datasets and the paper's own Landsat-8 cloud detection dataset
   with higher spatial resolution, the proposed method achieves competitive
   performance under different evaluation metrics. Code is available at

AB In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent recommendation is
   playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized
   information to users is the core concern of Internet content service
   providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to
   go beyond merely user-item interaction records and take social relations
   into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs)
   shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to
   refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not
   been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user
   preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to
   simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in
   both user-item interaction graph and user-user social graph and 2) they
   typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model,
   which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and
   hardly makes full use of GPU's computing ability. In light of this, we
   propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient
   adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce
   a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore
   the propagation process of user interest and social influence.
   Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate
   user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social
   IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN's parameters
   with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments
   under four scenarios show that our solution consistently and
   significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in both model
   effectiveness and training efficiency.

   avoid salt-and-pepper effects and cannot achieve high accuracy either.
   To solve these problems, object-based models such as graph neural
   networks (GNNs) are considered. However, traditional GNNs directly use
   similarity or spatial correlations between nodes to aggregate nodes'
   information, which rely too much on the contextual information of the
   sample. The contextual information of the sample is often distorted,
   which results in a reduction in the node classification accuracy. To
   solve this problem, a knowledge and geo-object-based graph convolutional
   network (KGGCN) is proposed. The KGGCN uses superpixel blocks as nodes
   of the graph network and combines prior knowledge with spatial
   correlations during information aggregation. By incorporating the prior
   knowledge obtained from all samples of the study area, the receptive
   field of the node is extended from its sample context to the study area.
   Thus, the distortion of the sample context is overcome effectively.
   Experiments demonstrate that our model is improved by 3.7% compared with
   the baseline model named Cluster GCN and 4.1% compared with U-Net.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been widely utilized in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification research due to its ability to
   automatically learn robust and powerful feature representations.
   Inter-patient relationships are effectively captured by constructing
   patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as graph data, where
   nodes represent individuals and edges denote the relationships between
   them. However, the performance of GCNs might be constrained by the
   construction of the graph adjacency matrix, thereby leading to learned
   features potentially overlooking intrinsic correlations among patients,
   which ultimately causes inaccurate disease classifications. To address
   this issue, we propose an Alzheimer's disease Classification network
   based on MRI utilizing diffusion maps for multi-scale feature fusion in
   graph convolution. This method aims to tackle the problem of features
   neglecting intrinsic relationships among patients while integrating
   features from diffusion mapping with different neighbor counts to better
   represent patients and achieve an accurate AD classification. Initially,
   the diffusion maps method conducts diffusion information in the feature
   space, thus breaking free from the constraints of diffusion based on the
   adjacency matrix. Subsequently, the diffusion features with different
   neighbor counts are merged, and a self-attention mechanism is employed
   to adaptively adjust the weights of diffusion features at different
   scales, thereby comprehensively and accurately capturing patient
   characteristics. Finally, metric learning techniques enhance the
   similarity of node features within the same category in the graph
   structure and bring node features of different categories more distant
   from each other. This study aims to enhance the classification accuracy
   of AD, by providing an effective tool for early diagnosis and
   intervention. It offers valuable information for clinical decisions and
   personalized treatment. Experimentation on the publicly accessible
   Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset validated our
   method's competitive performance across various AD-related
   classification tasks. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach
   captures patient characteristics more effectively and demonstrates
   superior generalization capabilities.

AB Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in
   long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article
   investigates multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks via link
   prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal
   muscle atrophy. Key target genes that cause muscle atrophy in the left
   and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius,
   quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are detected using
   graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic datasets
   collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We
   identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson
   correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease
   knowledge graph was constructed using the scalable precision medicine
   knowledge engine. We computed node embeddings, random walk measures from
   the networks. Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks,
   random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the
   embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top
   gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were
   selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link
   prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify
   top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy.
   The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on
   receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The
   key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with
   metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs selected for
   repurposing using the graph convolution network method were nutrients,
   corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and others related to
   insulin.

AB With the advancement of the user application service demands, the IoT
   system tends to offload the tasks to the edge server for execution. Most
   of the current studies on edge computation offloading ignore the
   dependencies between components of the application. The few pieces of
   research on edge computing offloading which focus on the topology of
   application are primarily applied in single-user scenarios. Unlike
   previous work, our work mainly solves dependent task offloading with
   edge computing in multiuser scenarios, which is more in line with
   reality. In this article, the dependent task offloading problem is
   modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) first. Then, we propose an
   actor-critic mechanism with two embedding layers for directed acyclic
   graphs (DAGs)-based multiple dependent tasks computation offloading,
   namely, ACED, by jointly considering the topology of the application and
   the channel interference between several users. Finally, the results of
   simulations also show the priorities of the proposed ACED algorithm.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become one of the essential
   approaches to effectively resolve problems such as traffic safety, road
   congestion, and energy consumption. However, due to the spatial-temporal
   interaction of the mixed traffic environment, the driving behaviors of
   traffic participants are continuously transmitted in time and space.
   This makes it difficult for the existing decision-making system of CAVs
   to make accurate judgments and effective strategies. In this study, a
   rate graph convolution Q-learning network (Rate GQN) is proposed to
   train a discrete strategy that can improve the comprehensive performance
   of CAVs in scenarios with spatial-temporal interaction. Firstly, the
   Rate algorithm is proposed to impose a ratio on the estimates of
   Q-values from the previous learning process, which improves the
   stability and performance of the algorithm by reducing the approximate
   error variance of the target value. Secondly, the traffic Scenario is
   modeled as a graph structure. And graph convolutional networks are
   adopted to extract the features information of graph structure to help
   the CAVs grasp the dynamic traffic interaction information quickly and
   accurately. Additionally, an internal dynamic multi-objective reward
   function is presented to improve the comprehensive performance of CAVs,
   including safety, efficiency, energy saving, and comfort. Finally,
   comparison and ablation experiments are constructed in a task-based
   traffic scenario (station stop and traffic light passing). The
   simulation results show that our Rate GQN method has faster training
   speed, a more stable training process, and better overall performance
   than the deep Q-learning network (DQN) and algorithms of the comparison
   group.

AB The purpose of text classification is to label the text with known
   labels. In recent years, the method based on graph neural network (GNN)
   has achieved good results. However, the existing methods based on GNN
   only regard the text as the set of co-occurring words, without
   considering the position information of each word in the statement. At
   the same time, the method mainly extracts the node features in the
   graph, and the edge features between the nodes are not used enough. To
   solve these problems, a new text classification method, graph
   convolutional network using positions and edges, is proposed. In the
   word embedding section, a positional encoding input representation is
   employed to enable the neural network to learn the relative positional
   information among words. Meanwhile, the dimension of the adjacency
   matrix is increased to extract the multi-dimensional edge features.
   Through experiments on multiple text classification datasets, the
   proposed method is shown to be superior to the traditional text
   classification method, and has achieved a maximum improvement of more
   than 4%.

AB Applying deep learning concepts from image detection and graph theory

   deep learning architecture consisting of a 3-dimensional convolutional

   convolu-tional networks utilizing attention-based aggregation of node
   features. HAC-Net (Hybrid Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network)
   obtains state-of-the-art results on the PDBbind v.2016 core set, the
   most widely recognized benchmark in the field. We extensively assess the
   generalizability of our model using multiple train-test splits, each of
   which maximizes differences between either protein structures, protein
   sequences, or ligand extended -connectivity fingerprints of complexes in
   the training and test sets. Furthermore, we perform 10-fold
   cross-validation with a similarity cutoff between SMILES strings of
   ligands in the training and test sets and also evaluate the performance
   of HAC-Net on lower -quality data. We envision that this model can be
   extended to a broad range of supervised learning problems related to
   structure -based biomolecular property prediction. All of our software
   is available as an open-source repository at

AB With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), object
   re-identification (Re-ID) based on the UAV platforms has attracted
   increasing attention, and several excellent achievements have been shown
   in the traditional scenarios. However, object Re-ID in aerial imagery
   acquired from the UAVs is still a challenging task, which is mainly due
   to the reason that variable locations and diverse viewpoints in UAVs
   platform are always resulting in more appearance ambiguities among the
   intra-objects and inter-objects. To address the above issues, in this
   paper, we proposed an adaptively attention-driven cascade part-based
   graph embedding framework (AAD-CPGE) for UAV object Re-ID. The AAD-CPGE
   aims to optimally fuse node features and their topological
   characteristics on the multi-scale structured graphs of parts-based
   objects, and then adaptively learn the most correlated information for
   improving the object Re-ID performance. Specifically, we first executed
   GCNs on the parts-based cascade node feature graphs and topological
   feature graphs for acquiring multi-scale structured-graph feature
   representations. After that, we designed a self-attention-based module
   for adaptive node and topological features fusion on the constructed
   hierarchical parts-based graphs. Finally, these learning hybrid
   graph-structured features with the most correlation discriminative
   capability were applied for object Re-ID. Several experimental
   verifications on three widely used UAVs-based benchmark datasets were
   carried out, and comparison with some state-of-the-art object Re-ID
   approaches validated the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed
   AAD-CPGE Re-ID framework.

AB Organic crystal structures exert a profound impact on the
   physicochemical properties and biological effects of organic compounds.
   Quantum mechanics (QM)-based crystal structure predictions (CSPs) have
   somewhat alleviated the dilemma that experimental crystal structure
   investigations struggle to conduct complete polymorphism studies, but
   the high computing cost poses a challenge to its widespread application.
   The present study aims to construct DeepCSP, a feasible pure machine
   learning framework for minute-scale rapid organic CSP. Initially, based
   on 177,746 data entries from the Cambridge Crystal Structure Database, a
   generative adversarial network was built to conditionally generate trial
   crystal structures under selected feature constraints for the given
   molecule. Simultaneously, a graph convolutional attention network was
   used to predict the density of stable crystal structures for the input
   molecule. Subsequently, the distances between the predicted density and
   the definition-based calculated density would be considered to be the
   crystal structure screening and ranking basis, and finally, the
   density-based crystal structure ranking would be output. Two such
   distinct algorithms, performing the generation and ranking
   functionalities, respectively, collectively constitute the DeepCSP,
   which has demonstrated compelling performance in marketed drug
   validations, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 80% and a hit rate
   surpassing 85%. Inspiringly, the computing speed of the pure machine
   learning methodology demonstrates the potential of artificial
   intelligence in advancing CSP research.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable
   performance in driver drowsiness detection based on the extraction of
   deep features of drivers' faces. However, the performance of driver
   drowsiness detection methods decreases sharply when complications, such
   as illumination changes in the cab, occlusions and shadows on the
   driver's face, and variations in the driver's head pose, occur. In
   addition, current driver drowsiness detection methods are not capable of
   distinguishing between driver states, such as talking versus yawning or
   blinking versus closing eyes. Therefore, technical challenges remain in
   driver drowsiness detection. In this article, we propose a novel and
   robust two-stream spatial-temporal graph convolutional network
   (2s-STGCN) for driver drowsiness detection to solve the above-mentioned
   challenges. To take advantage of the spatial and temporal features of
   the input data, we use a facial landmark detection method to extract the
   driver's facial landmarks from real-time videos and then obtain the
   driver drowsiness detection result by 2s-STGCN. Unlike existing methods,
   our proposed method uses videos rather than consecutive video frames as
   processing units. This is the first effort to exploit these processing
   units in the field of driver drowsiness detection. Moreover, the
   two-stream framework not only models both the spatial and temporal
   features but also models both the first-order and second-order
   information simultaneously, thereby notably improving driver drowsiness
   detection. Extensive experiments have been performed on the yawn
   detection dataset (YawDD) and the National TsingHua University drowsy
   driver detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset. The experimental results validate
   the feasibility of the proposed method. This method achieves an average
   accuracy of 93.4% on the YawDD dataset and an average accuracy of 92.7%
   on the evaluation set of the NTHU-DDD dataset.

   (DMP). The X% CuO/g-C(3)N(4 )Z-shceme photocatalyst samples were
   fabricated by thermal calcination method, varing the CuO percentage (X =
   2 %, 4 % and 8 %) loaded on g-C3N4. A lab-scale photoreactor was used to
   assess and select the optimal removal efficiency for DMP degradation.
   The photocatalyst was characterized by advanced spectral techniques.
   Coupling of CuO/GCN system with H2O2 significantly improved
   photocatalytic activity via photo-Fenton process. The kinetics of
   photo-degradation was found to exhibit pseudo-first order reaction
   rules. The rate of photodegradation was strongly influenced by pH and
   different concentrations of H2O2. 4%CuO/g-C3N4/H2O2 system proved to be
   the most efficient and exhibited much higher photo removal efficiency
   than CuO/g-C3N4 system and permitted attaining 99 % degradation of DMP
   in reaction time of 120 min. The successful implementation of this work
   was effective and of significance for the economical decomposition
   process of pollutants present in water under visible light irradiation.
   Overall, utilization of the studied system leads to high catalytic
   efficiency in a relatively short degradation period, which is of immense
   potential in water purification. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical

AB In the era of the Internet and big data, online social media platforms
   have been developing rapidly, which accelerate rumors circulation. Rumor
   detection on social media is a worldwide challenging task due to rumor's
   feature of high speed, fragmental information and extensive range. Most
   existing approaches identify rumors based on single-layered hybrid
   features like word features, sentiment features and user
   characteristics, or multimodal features like the combination of text
   features and image features. Some researchers adopted the hierarchical
   structure, but they neither used rumor propagation nor made full use of
   its retweet posts. In this paper, we propose a novel model for rumor
   detection based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named Hierarchically
   Aggregated Graph Neural Networks (HAGNN). This task focuses on capturing
   different granularities of high-level representations of text content
   and fusing the rumor propagation structure. It applies a Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) with a graph of rumor propagation to learn
   the text-granularity representations with the spreading of events. A GNN
   model with a document graph is employed to update aggregated features of
   both word and text granularity, it helps to form final representations
   of events to detect rumors. Experiments on two real-world datasets
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the baseline
   methods. Our model achieves the accuracy of 95.7% and 88.2% on the Weibo
   dataset Ma et al. 2017 and the CED dataset Song et al. IEEE Trans Knowl
   Data Eng 33(8):3035-3047, 2019 respectively.

AB The classification and recognition of the shapes of buildings in map
   space play an important role in spatial cognition, cartographic
   generalization, and map updating. As buildings in map space are often
   represented as the vector data, research was conducted to learn the
   feature representations of the buildings and recognize their shapes
   based on graph neural networks. Due to the principles of graph neural
   networks, it is necessary to construct a graph to represent the
   adjacency relationships between the points (i.e., the vertices of the
   polygons shaping the buildings), and extract a list of geometric
   features for each point. This paper proposes a deep point convolutional
   network to recognize building shapes, which executes the convolution
   directly on the points of the buildings without constructing the graphs
   and extracting the geometric features of the points. A new convolution
   operator named TriangleConv was designed to learn the feature
   representations of each point by aggregating the features of the point
   and the local triangle constructed by the point and its two adjacency
   points. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with related
   methods based on a dataset consisting of 5010 vector buildings. In terms
   of accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1, the results
   show that the proposed method has comparable performance with typical
   graph neural networks of GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, and point cloud neural
   networks of PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN in the task of recognizing
   and classifying building shapes in map space.

AB Aiming at the problems of complex background, diverse shapes, and object
   occlusion in aerial images, a cascade reasoning graph network (CRGN) is
   proposed for multi-fitting detection on transmission lines. First of
   all, for these three problems mentioned above, co-occurrence knowledge,
   semantic knowledge, and spatial knowledge were constructed to represent
   the co-relation of objects by analyzing the characteristics of the
   transmission line fittings. Next, the Supervised Graph Learning (SGL),
   Graph Attention network (GAT), and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   were employed to reason corresponding knowledge. In addition, to
   generate more accurate proposals for the graph reasoning module,
   resampling was carried out through the cascade network. Finally, the
   enhanced features were fused with the original visual features to
   recognize and position the fittings. Test results show that CRGN can
   improve the detection effect of multi-fittings on the transmission line,
   especially for some hard-detection fittings.

AB This study reports the synthesis of a highly efficient
   visible-light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and H2O2
   production by manipulating the electronic band structure and surface
   properties of g-C3N4. Boron and caesium co-doped g-C3N4 porous and
   wrinkled nanosheets were nobly synthesized by using recrystallization of
   melamine in water in the presence of boric acid and CsCl followed by
   calcination and thermal etching. The prepared nanosheets showed an
   extremely porous and wrinkled structure with high surface area and edge
   sites. The optimized B, Cs co-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibited a stable
   hydrogen evolution rate of 1,120 mu molg-1h-1 in the presence of
   triethanolamine, which is 7.7 times higher than that of the bulk.
   Moreover, this optimized structure showed a greatly increased hydrogen
   peroxide production rate of 113 mu molg-1h-1 compared to that (19 mu
   molg-1h- 1) of the bulk GCN-B. Meanwhile, the optimized structure showed
   a high photooxidation ability toward RhB oxidation. This outstanding
   improvement in photocatalytic performance is attributed to the enhanced
   charge carrier mobility in the pi-conjugated structure and increased
   accessible reaction sites for photocatalytic reactions originated from
   the synergetic effect of co-doping and formation of the porous and
   wrinkled nanosheets.

AB In the User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA), unknown malicious
   behaviours are often difficult to be automatically detected due to the
   lack of labelled data. Most of the existing methods also fail to take
   full advantage of the threat intelligence and incorporate the impact of
   the behaviour patterns of the benign users. To address this issue, this
   paper proposes a Generalised Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) method based on
   hyper-spherical Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). Compared to the VAEs,
   the authors' proposed method is more robust and suitable for capturing
   data with richer and more nuanced structures. The authors' method
   analyses the unknown malicious behaviours by projecting them and their
   semantic attributes to shared space. These are then matched by the
   cosine similarity. The authors further use a Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) to reduce the impact of different user behaviour patterns before
   projection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method
   is efficient in the analysis of unknown malicious behaviours.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally, killing 1.8
   million people yearly. Over 85% of lung cancer cases are non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung cancer running in families has shown that some
   genes are linked to lung cancer. Genes associated with NSCLC have been
   found by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS). Many papers, however, neglected the complex information
   about interactions between gene pairs. Along with its high cost, GWAS
   analysis has an obvious drawback of false-positive results. Based on the
   above problem, computational techniques are used to offer researchers
   alternative and complementary low-cost disease-gene association
   findings. To help find NSCLC-related genes, we proposed a new
   network-based machine learning method, named deepRW, to predict genes
   linked to NSCLC. We first constructed a gene interaction network
   consisting of genes that are related and irrelevant to NSCLC disease and
   used deep walk and graph convolutional network (GCN) method to learn
   gene-disease interactions. Finally, deep neural network (DNN) was
   utilized as the prediction module to decide which genes are related to
   NSCLC. To evaluate the performance of deepRW, we ran tests with 10-fold
   cross-validation. The experimental results showed that our method
   greatly exceeded the existing methods. In addition, the effectiveness of
   each module in deepRW was demonstrated in comparative experiments.

AB The real-world recommender system needs to be regularly retrained to
   keep with the new data. In this work, we consider how to efficiently
   retrain graph convolution network (GCN)-based recommender models that
   are state-of-the-art techniques for the collaborative recommendation. To
   pursue high efficiency, we set the target as using only new data for
   model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing the recommendation accuracy
   compared with full model retraining. This is nontrivial to achieve since
   the interaction data participates in both the graph structure for model
   construction and the loss function for model learning, whereas the old
   graph structure is not allowed to use in model updating. Toward the
   goal, we propose a causal incremental graph convolution (IGC) approach,
   which consists of two new operators named IGC and colliding effect
   distillation (CED) to estimate the output of full graph convolution. In
   particular, we devise simple and effective modules for IGC to
   ingeniously combine the old representations and the incremental graph
   and effectively fuse the long- and short-term preference signals. CED
   aims to avoid the out-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in
   the incremental graph, which connects the new data with inactive nodes
   through causal inference. In particular, CED estimates the causal effect
   of new data on the representation of inactive nodes through the control
   of their collider. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
   demonstrate both accuracy gains and significant speed-ups over the
   existing retraining mechanism.

AB In recent years, traffic flow prediction has been extensively explored
   in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is beneficial for reducing
   traffic jams and accidents as well as optimizing traffic network
   resources. Most of the previous methods divide cities into equal-sized
   grids and predict flows within one grid. However, we believe that each
   area is not independent, and there are interactions between areas. And
   the interaction between areas belonging to different attributes is more
   regular. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Attribute Graph Convolutional
   Network (MAGCN) for regional traffic flow prediction. Based on the
   attributes to which the areas belong, we divide cities into
   unequal-sized grids, and then a matrix is constructed using the flow of
   Functional area-based Origin-Destination pairs. GCN and dilated causal
   convolution allow the model to capture the spatial correlation and
   temporal dependence between functional regions while overcoming the
   under-fitting of local peaks. Extensive experimental results and
   evaluation metrics on two real-world datasets show that the MAGCN
   outperforms the baselines and has a higher accuracy for traffic flow
   prediction.

AB Metro passenger flow prediction is a strategically necessary demand in
   an intelligent transportation system to alleviate traffic pressure,
   coordinate operation schedules, and plan future constructions.
   Graph-based neural networks have been widely used in traffic flow
   prediction problems. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) captures
   spatial features according to established connections but ignores the
   high-order relationships between stations and the travel patterns of
   passengers. In this paper, we utilize a novel representation to tackle
   this issue - hypergraph. A dynamic spatio-temporal hypergraph neural
   network to forecast passenger flow is proposed. In the prediction
   framework, the primary hypergraph is constructed from metro system
   topology and then extended with advanced hyperedges discovered from
   pedestrian travel patterns of multiple time spans. Furthermore,
   hypergraph convolution and spatio-temporal blocks are proposed to
   extract spatial and temporal features to achieve node-level prediction.
   Experiments on historical datasets of Beijing and Hangzhou validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and superior performance of
   prediction accuracy is achieved compared with the state-of-the-arts.

AB As a typical unsupervised machine learning task, clustering is always a
   hot research topic. Motivated by deep learning approaches, deep
   clustering has become prevalent in recent years, and achieves appealing
   performance. Most of current deep clustering methods focus on learning a
   new discriminative represen-tation to enhance separability of original
   data, i.e., autoencoder, multilayer perceptrons and deep belief
   networks. However, the structure information which is very important in
   unsupervised learning, attracts little attention in previous deep
   feature representation learning clustering works. In this paper, a
   dynamic graph evolution based graph convolutional network (DGE-GCN) is
   introduced for clustering task, in which the data structural information
   and learned latent features are integrated into a unified network for
   deep clustering. Instead of using a fixed graph during the graph
   convolution process, we design a dynamic graph evolution strategy to
   refine the initial graph which could be not accurate. In addition, the
   latent representations learned by an autoencoder are embedded for
   refining the graph in a layer-wise man-ner. In such a manner, the latent
   features can help improve the graph structure, while the refined graph
   can in turn constrain the autoencoder to learn more discriminative
   features. In order to unify the graph convolutional network branch and
   autoencoder branch, a dual self-supervised mechanism is designed to
   guide the parameter learning of the whole network architecture.
   Comprehensive experiments demon-strate that the proposed network

AB Exploiting the inner-shot and inter-shot dependencies is essential for
   key-shot based video summarization. Current approaches mainly devote to
   modeling the video as a frame sequence by recurrent neural networks.
   However, one potential limitation of the sequence models is that they
   focus on capturing local neighborhood dependencies while the high-order
   dependencies in long distance are not fully exploited. In general, the
   frames in each shot record a certain activity and vary smoothly over
   time, but the multi-hop relationships occur frequently among shots. In
   this case, both the local and global dependencies are important for
   understanding the video content. Motivated by this point, we propose a
   reconstructive sequence-graph network (RSGN) to encode the frames and
   shots as sequence and graph hierarchically, where the frame-level
   dependencies are encoded by long short-term memory (LSTM), and the
   shot-level dependencies are captured by the graph convolutional network
   (GCN). Then, the videos are summarized by exploiting both the local and
   global dependencies among shots. Besides, a reconstructor is developed
   to reward the summary generator, so that the generator can be optimized
   in an unsupervised manner, which can avert the lack of annotated data in
   video summarization. Furthermore, under the guidance of reconstruction
   loss, the predicted summary can better preserve the main video content
   and shot-level dependencies. Practically, the experimental results on
   three popular datasets (i.e., SumMe, TVsum and VTW) have demonstrated
   the superiority of our proposed approach to the summarization task.

AB Generating person images has been a promising approach to enhance the
   input richness for re-identification (reID) tasks in recent works. A key
   challenge is that the generated data often contains noise, which is
   caused by identity inconsistency between the generated person and the
   original input and failure cases in generative adversarial networks
   (GAN). Directly training using generated images may greatly affect
   learning good feature embeddings, resulting in unsatisfactory reID
   performance. This work presents a two-stage framework that can generate
   high-quality person images and purify failure cases for reID training.
   Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed generative model can
   produce person images with superior appearance consistency comparing
   with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that our
   method yields a significant improvement in re-identification (reID) task
   on public datasets with insufficient training data.

AB Deep-learning-based salient object detection (SOD) has achieved
   significant success in recent years. The SOD focuses on the context
   modeling of the scene information, and how to effectively model the
   context relationship in the scene is the key. However, it is difficult
   to build an effective context structure and model it. In this article,
   we propose a novel SOD method called dynamic and adaptive graph
   convolutional network (DAGCN) that is composed of two parts, adaptive
   neighborhood-wise graph convolutional network (AnwGCN) and spatially
   restricted K-nearest neighbors (SRKNN). The AnwGCN is novel adaptive
   neighborhood-wise graph convolution, which is used to model and analyze
   the saliency context. The SRKNN constructs the topological relationship
   of the saliency context by measuring the non-Euclidean spatial distance
   within a limited range. The proposed method constructs the context
   relationship as a topological graph by measuring the distance of the
   features in the non-Euclidean space, and conducts comparative modeling
   of context information through AnwGCN. The model has the ability to
   learn the metrics from features and can adapt to the hidden space
   distribution of the data. The description of the feature relationship is
   more accurate. Through the convolutional kernel adapted to the
   neighborhood, the model obtains the structure learning ability.
   Therefore, the graph convolution process can adapt to different graph
   data. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution achieves
   satisfactory performance on six widely used datasets and can also
   effectively detect camouflaged objects. Our code will be available at:

   algorithm with graph convolution network and multi-alignment in mixed
   latent space, which leverages domain labels, data structure, and
   category labels in a unified network but improves domain-invariant
   semantic representation by several innovations. Specifically, a novel
   data structure alignment is proposed to exploit the inherent properties
   of different domains while using current domain alignment and
   classification result alignment. Through this design, category
   consistency can be considered in both latent space, and domain and
   structure discrepancy between different source domains and the target
   domain can be eliminated. Moreover, we also use category alignment based
   on both CNN and GCN features to optimize category decision boundary.
   Experiment results show that the proposed method brings sufficient
   improvement especially for adaptation tasks with large shift in data
   distribution.

AB Accurate urban travel demand forecasting can help organize traffic flow,
   improve traffic utilization, reduce passenger waiting time, etc. It
   plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Most of
   the existing research methods construct static graphs from a single
   perspective or two perspectives, without considering the dynamic impact
   of time changes and various factors on traffic demand. Moreover, travel
   demand is also affected by regional functions such as weather, etc. To
   address these issues, we propose an urban travel demand prediction
   framework based on dynamic multi-view coupled graph convolution
   (DMV-GCN). Specifically, we dynamically construct demand similarity
   graphs based on node features to model the dynamic correlation of
   demand. Then we combine it with the predefined geographic similarity
   graph, functional similarity graph, and road similarity graph. We use
   coupled graph convolution network and gated recurrent units (GRU), to
   model the spatio-temporal correlation in traffic. We conduct extensive
   experiments over two large real-world datasets. The results verify the
   superior performance of our proposed approach for the urban travel
   demand forecasting task.

AB Because of the advantages of graphs in visualizing the relationship
   between individuals, complex networks have been widely used and greatly
   developed. In real-world applications of Dempster-Shafer evidence
   theory, there are usually thousands of sensors collecting information.
   It is easy to be overwhelmed by the mass of information and ignore the
   connections between them. The rise of the semisupervised learning method
   graph convolutional network makes it possible to address this issue. In
   this article, inspired by complex network, the basic probability
   assignment function, the base function of evidence theory, is modeled in
   a novel form of the network graph. Some typical issues of evidence
   theory, such as conflicting evidence, multiclass evidence clustering,
   and computational complexity for large-scale fusion are systematically
   addressed in the framework of the proposed network model. What's more, a
   new combination rule is presented from the point view of the graph. The
   empirical results of experiments on real data set demonstrate the
   potential and feasibility of complex networks in traditional evidence

AB Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) aims to recognize novel actions that
   have not been seen in the training stage. However, ZSAR always suffers
   from serious domain shift problem, which causes poor performance. This
   is because: 1) Videos contain complicated intrinsic structures,
   including cross-sample visual correlations and cross-category semantic
   relationships, which make it challenging to generalize domain shift over
   categories and transfer knowledge across videos. 2) Existing methods do
   not disentangle unique and shared information underlying unseen videos
   during embedding. They are always weakly adaptive to novel categories
   and easily shift unseen videos to irrelevant action prototypes. In this
   paper, we propose a novel Coupling Adversarial Graph Embedding (CAGE)
   method for ZSAR, which formulates an effective visual-to-semantic
   embedding to alleviate the domain shift problem. Our model implements in
   a transductive setting that assumes accessing to a full set of unseen
   videos. Firstly, a structured graph is built for expressing both seen
   and unseen videos, which integrally captures visual and semantic
   relationships between them. Then, an effective visual-to-semantic
   embedding is formulated based on graph convolutional network (GCN),
   which is generalized to disjoint action categories and optimized for
   label propagation. In addition, a couple of adversarial constraints are
   proposed to characterize unique information of unseen videos and purify
   shared information across categories, which further improve the
   adaptability and discriminability of our model. Experiments on Olympic
   sports, HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets show that our model achieves
   impressive performance on ZSAR task. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB As a multi-label classification task, audio tagging aims to predict the
   presence or absence of certain sound events in an audio recording.
   Existing works in audio tagging do not explicitly consider the
   probabilities of the co-occurrences between sound events, which is
   termed as the label dependencies in this study. To address this issue,
   we propose to model the label dependencies via a graph-based method,
   where each node of the graph represents a label. An adjacency matrix is
   constructed by mining the statistical relations between labels to
   represent the graph structure information, and a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) is employed to learn node representations by propagating
   information between neighboring nodes based on the adjacency matrix,
   which implicitly models the label dependencies. The generated node
   representations are then applied to the acoustic representations for
   classification. Experiments on Audioset show that our method achieves a
   state-of-the-art mean average precision (mAP) of 0.434.

AB With the rapid development of edge computing, online social network
   services are growing explosively. Social influence plays a critical role
   in the propagation of social network information. Influence maximization
   is a key issue in social network analysis. Temporal-aware influence
   maximization has been emerging in recent years. It integrates temporal
   information into the classical influence maximization. The purpose for
   temporal-aware influence maximization is to identify the optimal users
   in a network that can influence the most individuals under a certain
   time constraint. Although each node activation is treated equally within
   a finite time window in existing studies. In reality, the time required
   for each user to get influenced varies. In contrast, because
   temporal-aware influence maximization is NP-hard, a number of studies
   have proposed approximate algorithms based on sample instances to
   estimate the expected influence spread of nodes. However, these methods
   require significant computational overheads. Therefore, this study
   presents learning-based time-decaying influence maximization.
   Specifically, this study first presents the time-decaying influence
   maximization, where each user has a utility score that monotonically
   decreases over time. Subsequently, it develops AttenLSTM-GCN to generate
   node embeddings that capture structural-temporal information. Then, it
   adopts Q-learning algorithm to predict the time-decaying influence of
   nodes. Based on these algorithms, the solution of time-decaying
   influence maximization can be obtained. Experimental studies on real
   world networks demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more
   significant accelerations and high-quality solutions than advanced
   algorithms.

AB The development of effective sorbents is of great significance for
   realizing the immobilization of gaseous elemental mercury from
   coal-fired flue gas. Herein, CuS/CeO2 composite sorbent was synthesized
   by a simple precipitation method for the removal of elemental mercury
   from flue gas. The ability of CuS/CeO2 to capture mercury at different
   temperatures and different flue gas components (HCl, SO2, O2 and NO)
   were tested. It indicates that CuS/CeO2 exhibits excellent Hg0 removal
   performance both at 60-150 degrees C and in different flue gas
   components. Moreover, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of CuS/CeO2
   was 32.304 mg g-1 at 120 degrees C, which was 59.8 times that of CuS/GCN
   and 190 times that of ZnS modified activated carbon. Density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations further verified that the synergistic
   relationship between defect oxygen and unsaturated sulfur sites on the
   surface promotes the Hg0 removal performance of CuS/CeO2. By virtue of
   these advantages, CuS/ CeO2 is a prodigious candidate for the effective
   mercury removal from various types of industrial flue gases. This work
   may open-up new approaches for the development of heavy metal sorbents
   through the inter-doping of metal sulfides with transition metal oxides
   to enhance surface active sites to tune the adsorption capacity.

   for Branch1 and Branch3, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used
   to predict lameness according to the input images and optical flow, and
   for Branch2, a spatial temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) was
   used to predict lameness according to the cows' skeletons. Finally, the
   weight was adjusted, and the prediction scores of these three branches
   were fused to complete the lameness detection process. In this research,
   680 different videos were used for training and testing. The
   segmentation ratio of the train set and test set was 6:1. The best ACC
   was 97.20% when the weight of the RGB, optical flow and skeletons was
   1:0.5:0.5. To verify the robustness of the method, the gamma transform
   was used to adjust the brightness of the image to simulate a change in
   illumination. Under different illumination settings, the maximum error
   of the method was 2.65%, which was significantly lower than other
   methods without skeletons. The results showed that the proposed method
   was effective for the detection of early-stage lameness, severe
   lameness, and non-lameness of dairy cows.(c) 2022 IAgrE. Published by

AB Long gamma-ray burst GRB 191016A was a bright and slow rising burst that
   was detected by the Swift satellite and followed up by ground based
   Liverpool Telescope (LT). LT follow up started 2411 s after the Swift
   Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger using imager IO:O around the time of
   the late optical peak. From 3987-7687 s, we used the LT polarimeter
   RINGO3 to make polarimetric and photometric observations of the GRB
   simultaneously in the V, R, and I bands. The combined optical light
   curve shows an initial late peak followed by a decline until 6147 s,
   6087 s, and 5247 s for I, R, and V filters respectively followed by a
   flattening phase. There is evidence of polarization at all phases
   including polarization (P = 14.6 +/- 7.2 per cent) which is coincident
   with the start of the flattening phase. The combination of the light
   curve morphology and polarization measurement favours an energy
   injection scenario where slower magnetized ejecta from the central
   engine catches up with the decelerating blast wave. We calculate the
   minimum energy injection to be Delta E/E > 0.36. At a later time,
   combining the optical light curve from Burst Observer and Optical
   Transient Exploring System (BOOTES) (reported via GCN) and IO:O we see
   evidence of a jet break with jet opening angle 2 degrees.

AB Gene co-expression networks (GCN) present undirected relations between
   genes to understand molecular structures behind the diseases, including
   cancer. The utilization of various biological datasets and gene network
   inference (GNI) algorithms can reveal meaningful gene-gene interactions
   of GCNs. This study applies three GNI algorithms on mRNA gene
   expression, RNA-Seq, and miRNA-target genes datasets to infer GCNs of
   breast and prostate cancers. To evaluate the performance of the GCNs, we
   utilize overlap analysis via literature data, topological assessment,
   and Gene Ontology-based biological assessment. The results emphasize how
   the selection of biological datasets and GNI algorithms affect the
   performance results on different evaluation criteria. GCNs on microarray
   gene expression data slightly outperform in overlap analysis. Also, GCNs
   on RNA-Seq and gene expression datasets follow scale-free topology. The
   biological assessment results are close to each other on all biological
   datasets. C3NET algorithm-based GCNs did not contain any biological
   assessment modules; therefore, it is not optimal for biological
   assessment. GNI algorithms' selection did not change the overlap
   analysis and topological assessment results. Our primary objective is to
   compare the performance results of biological datasets and GNI
   algorithms based on different evaluation criteria. For this purpose, we
   developed the GNIAP R package that enables users to select different GNI
   algorithms to infer GCNs. The GNIAP R package also provides
   literature-based overlap analysis, and topological and biological
   analyses on GCNs. Users can access the GNIAP R package via .

AB Author summary
   The recognition of circRNA-disease association is the key of disease
   diagnosis and treatment, and it is of great significance for exploring
   the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Computational methods can predict
   the potential disease-related circRNAs quickly and accurately. Based on
   the hypothesis that circRNA with similar function tends to associate
   with similar disease, GCNCDA model is proposed to effectively predict
   the potential association between circRNAs and diseases by combining
   FastGCN algorithm. The performance of the model was verified by
   cross-validation experiments, different feature extraction algorithm and
   classifier models comparison experiments. Furthermore, 16, 15 and 17 of
   the top 20 candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores in
   disease including breast cancer, glioma and colorectal cancer were
   respectively confirmed by relevant literature and databases. It is
   anticipated that GCNCDA model can give priority to the most promising
   circRNA-disease associations on a large scale to provide reliable
   candidates for further biological experiments.
   Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely
   involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the
   association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in
   exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the
   diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex
   mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and
   time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by
   biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for
   utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease
   associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called
   GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional
   Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated
   circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by
   fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA
   Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based
   on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then
   used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the
   fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are
   accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA)
   classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved
   91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on
   circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier
   models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods,
   GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, we conducted case
   study experiments on diseases including breast cancer, glioma and
   colorectal cancer. The results showed that 16, 15 and 17 of the top 20
   candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were respectively
   confirmed by relevant literature and databases. These results suggest
   that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease
   associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological
   experiments.

AB Objective. To extend the highly successful U-Net Convolutional Neural
   Network architecture, which is limited to rectangular pixel/voxel
   domains, to a graph-based equivalent that works flexibly on irregular
   meshes; and demonstrate the effectiveness on electrical impedance
   tomography (EIT). Approach. By interpreting the irregular mesh as a
   graph, we develop a graph U-Net with new cluster pooling and unpooling
   layers that mimic the classic neighborhood based max-pooling important
   for imaging applications. Main results. The proposed graph U-Net is
   shown to be flexible and effective for improving early iterate total
   variation (TV) reconstructions from EIT measurements, using as little as
   the first iteration. The performance is evaluated for simulated data,
   and on experimental data from three measurement devices with different
   measurement geometries and instrumentations. We successfully show that
   such networks can be trained with a simple two-dimensional simulated
   training set, and generalize to very different domains, including
   measurements from a three-dimensional device and subsequent 3D
   reconstructions. Significance. As many inverse problems are solved on
   irregular (e.g. finite element) meshes, the proposed graph U-Net and
   pooling layers provide the added flexibility to process directly on the
   computational mesh. Post-processing an early iterate reconstruction
   greatly reduces the computational cost which can become prohibitive in
   higher dimensions with dense meshes. As the graph structure is
   independent of 'dimension', the flexibility to extend networks trained
   on 2D domains to 3D domains offers a possibility to further reduce
   computational cost in training.

AB Recently, the major environmental pollution produced by the release of
   wastewater in liquid type is one of the most extensive forms of foremost
   pollution in water ecosystems. In this article, the Bi2O3/g-C3N4
   nanocomposite with a direct Z-scheme was effectively obtained by a
   facile hydrothermal system. The crystal structures, surface morphology,
   chemical composition, and the optical belongings of the as-obtained
   composite catalysts were examined by Power XRD, FT-IR spectra,
   High-resolution XPS spectra, FE-SEM images with EDX spectra, High
   -resolution TEM images, UV-Vis DRS, and PL spectra respectively.
   Furthermore, the photocatalytic perfor-mance was assessed by the
   degradation of aqueous Rhodamine B (Rh B) dye under visible-light
   exposure. The Bi2O3/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts (PCs) showed the
   maximum photo-degradation efficiency through a rate constant value of
   0.0149 min-1, which is 4.9 and 5.3 folds superior to Bi2O3, and GCN,
   respectively. The better GBO2 nanocomposite PCs showed a superior
   photocatalytic degradation performance (>82%) of aqueous Rh B dye after
   five successive recycles. Moreover, based on these outcomes of the
   radical scavenging test, a direct and effective Z-scheme photocatalytic
   charger transfer mechanism was also projected. Finally, the reusability
   of the as-obtained Bi2O3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite has better stability and
   reusability, which was a favourable applicant for wastewater handling.

AB Abstract Footpad dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin that affects
   the surface of the sole of the foot; the skin of the tarsal joint and;
   in severe cases; the bone of the pectoral keel. It is a multicausal
   pathology in which the environment; nutrition and intestinal integrity
   are involved. It affects animal welfare and generates economic losses
   due to confiscation during slaughtering. The objective of this work was
   to evaluate the plantar lesions in 40-day-old Cobb 500 chickens; housed
   in two production systems: new litter (NL) and litter used in four
   periods (UL). It was observed that 77% of the animals housed in NL did
   not present lesions; and 23% presented lesions of grade 1 or 2. On the
   other hand; 28% of the animals housed in UL did not present lesions;
   while 72% presented lesions of grade 1 or 2. The percentages of lesions
   found in both groups were significantly different (p<0.001); pointing
   out that animals located on UL are 8.6 times more likely to present
   lesions of greater degree than those housed on a new bed.
X4 Resumen La dermatitis de contacto es una inflamación cutánea que afecta
   la superficie de la planta del pie; la piel de la articulación del tarso
   y; además -en casos severos- el área del hueso de la quilla pectoral. Es
   una patología originada por múltiples causas; en la que están
   involucrados el medio ambiente; la nutrición y la integridad intestinal.
   Su importancia radica en que afecta el bienestar animal y genera
   pérdidas económicas por decomisos en la faena. El objetivo de este
   trabajo fue evaluar las lesiones plantares; en pollos Cobb 500 de 40
   días de edad alojados en dos sistemas de producción: galpón con cama
   nueva (GCN) y galpón con cama utilizada en cuatro períodos (GCU). Se
   observó que el 77% de los animales alojados en GCN no presentaron
   lesiones; y que el 23% restante presentó lesiones de grado 1 ó 2;
   mientras que 28% de los animales alojados en GCU no presentaron lesiones
   y el 72% presentaron lesiones de grado 1 ó 2. Los porcentajes de
   lesiones hallados en ambos grupos fue significativamente diferente
   (p<0;001); señalando que los animales que se encuentran en la cama usada
   tienen 8;6 veces más probabilidades de presentar lesiones de mayor grado
   que los alojados sobre cama nueva.

AB Objective Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) features high frequency of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) and fluctuating complement levels. The
   clinical trial Atherosclerosis Prevention in Pediatric Lupus
   Erythematosus (APPLE) aimed to evaluate whether atorvastatin treatment
   reduced the progression of atherosclerosis in 221 patients with
   childhood-onset SLE (cSLE), using carotid intima media thickness (CIMT)
   as surrogates. We leveraged APPLE biorepository and trial data to
   investigate the relationship between complement and CVD in cSLE.
   Methods Gene copy numbers (GCNs) for total C4, C4A and C4B were measured
   by TaqMan-based real-time PCR and Southern blotting, and analysed with
   laboratory and clinical parameters through Student's t-test and chi(2)
   analyses. Effects of total C4, C4A and C4B GCNs on the response to
   placebo or atorvastatin treatment and progression of CIMT were examined
   by regression analyses.
   Results At baseline, C4 protein levels strongly correlated with GCNs of
   total C4 (p=1.8x10(-6)). Each copy of C4 gene increased mean serum C4 by
   3.28 mg/dL. Compared with those without hypertension (N=142),
   individuals with hypertension demonstrated significantly elevated serum
   levels for C4 and C3 at baseline and serially (C4: P=5.0x10(-25); C3:
   P=5.84x10(-20)). Individuals with >= 2 C4B genes had 2.5 times the odds
   of having hypertension (p=0.016) and higher diastolic blood pressure
   (p=0.015) compared with those with C4B deficiency. At the study end,
   subjects with >= 2 C4B and atorvastatin treatment had significantly
   slower increase in CIMT compared with those treated with placebo
   (p=0.018).
   Conclusions cSLE with hypertension had elevated serum levels of C4 and
   C3 and higher GCN of C4B; cSLE with >= 2 C4B genes would benefit from
   statins therapy to prevent atherosclerosis.

AB To explore the prognostic related factors and mechanisms of gastric
   cancer (GC), we performed the systematic analysis with integrated
   bioinformatics tools based on multiple on-line datasets. With univariate
   COX analysis, we screened out 37 survival hazardous genes in GC. Further
   GO assays disclosed that the signatures related with extracellular
   matrix and structure, and the functions of "cell adhesion molecule
   binding" and "integrin binding" were the vital mechanisms of disease
   progression, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) was the
   potential biomarker for prognosis. Based on GSEA, GSVA and GCN, TIMP2
   was demonstrated to interact with multiple integrin pathways and involve
   in the regulation of EMT, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis of GC. The
   associations of TIMP2 expression with reduced OS and RFS of patients
   were declared by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and further confirmed by 1000
   internal bootstrap replications and external KM plotter analysis. With
   multi-variate COX regression and time-dependent ROC analysis, we
   validated the prediction independency and capacity of TIMP2 for
   prognosis. The relationships of TIMP2 with clinicopathological
   characteristics were also uncovered. Taken together, our findings
   identify TIMP2 as the novel candidate biomarker for poorer outcome of GC
   patients, and revealed the underlying functions of TIMP2 and the
   potential mechanisms for GC progression.

AB Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have recently attracted considerable attention
   due to their key roles in biology. The ncRNA-proteins interaction (NPI)
   is often explored to reveal some biological activities that ncRNA may
   affect, such as biological traits, diseases, etc. Traditional
   experimental methods can accomplish this work but are often
   labor-intensive and expensive. Machine learning and deep learning
   methods have achieved great success by exploiting sufficient sequence or
   structure information. Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods consider
   the topology in ncRNA-protein graphs and perform well on tasks like NPI
   prediction. Based on GNN, some pairwise constraint methods have been
   developed to apply on homogeneous networks, but not used for NPI
   prediction on heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we construct a
   pairwise constrained NPI predictor based on dual Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) called NPI-DGCN. To our knowledge, our method is the first
   to train a heterogeneous graph-based model using a pairwise learning
   strategy. Instead of binary classification, we use a rank layer to
   calculate the score of an ncRNA-protein pair. Moreover, our model is the
   first to predict NPIs on the ncRNA-protein bipartite graph rather than
   the homogeneous graph. We transform the original ncRNA-protein bipartite
   graph into two homogenous graphs on which to explore second-order
   implicit relationships. At the same time, we model direct interactions
   between two homogenous graphs to explore explicit relationships.
   Experimental results on the four standard datasets indicate that our
   method achieves competitive performance with other state-of-the-art
   methods. And the model is available at

AB Tactic recognition in sports videos is a challenging task. To address
   this, we present a novel spatio-temporal relation modeling approach,
   which captures both detailed player interactions and long-range group
   dynamics in tactics. In spatial modeling, we propose an Adaptive Graph
   Convolutional Network (A-GCN), and it represents individual and common
   patterns of data through local and global graphs to learn diverse player
   interactions. In temporal modeling, we propose an Attentive Temporal
   Convolutional Network (A-TCN) and with spatial configurations as input,
   it builds group dynamics and is robust to redundant content by
   considering sequence dependencies. Due to adaptive interaction and
   attentive dynamics modeling, our approach is able to comprehensively
   describe team cooperation over time in a tactic. We extensively evaluate
   the proposed approach on the Volleyball dataset and a newly collected
   VolleyTactic dataset, and the experimental results show its advantage.

AB Cervical cancer causes the fourth most cancer-related deaths of women
   worldwide. Early detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
   can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. In this paper,
   we propose a deep learning framework for the accurate identification of
   LSIL+ (including CIN and cervical cancer) using time-lapsed colposcopic
   images. The proposed framework involves two main components, i.e.,
   key-frame feature encoding networks and feature fusion network. The
   features of the original (pre-acetic-acid) image and the colposcopic
   images captured at around 60s, 90s, 120s and 150s during the acetic acid
   test are encoded by the feature encoding networks. Several fusion
   approaches are compared, all of which outperform the existing automated
   cervical cancer diagnosis systems using a single time slot. A graph
   convolutional network with edge features (E-GCN) is found to be the most
   suitable fusion approach in our study, due to its excellent
   explainability consistent with the clinical practice. A large-scale
   dataset, containing time-lapsed colposcopic images from 7,668 patients,
   is collected from the collaborative hospital to train and validate our
   deep learning framework. Colposcopists are invited to compete with our
   computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed deep learning framework
   achieves a classification accuracy of 78.33%-comparable to that of an
   in-service colposcopist-which demonstrates its potential to provide
   assistance in the realistic clinical scenario.

AB In photoelectric countermeasure systems, the infrared imaging of
   missiles is critical for automatic recognition and tracking technology
   of aerial targets. However, complex and newly emerging infrared
   interference signals severely hinder the recognition performance and
   lock the target ability of infrared thermal imaging systems. Although
   considerable progress has been achieved in the development of machine
   vision systems for missile detection, their performance and robustness
   should be improved. The brain can detect learned objects in various
   nonideal situations (partial occlusion and various perspectives). A
   novel graph network learning framework was developed for object
   recognition. This brain-inspired anti-interference recognition model can
   be used for detecting aerial targets composed of various spatial
   relationships. A spatially correlated skeletal graph model was used to
   represent the prototype using the graph convolutional network.
   Furthermore, a novel anti-occlusion framework based on a multisemantic
   skeleton graph model was proposed to overcome the discontinuity of
   target features caused by occlusion. In this method, the location of
   occluded key points was inferred by learning high-order relationships
   and node topology information. In this study, local image features were
   considered as graph nodes and a high-order relationship learning module
   was proposed to transfer relational information between nodes. In this
   module, the degree of connection between target keypoints was learned to
   automatically suppress the delivery of meaningless features. Second, a
   high-order topology learning module that simultaneously learns
   topological information and embeds local features was proposed to
   directly predict node similarity scores. Finally, extensive experiments
   were conducted on the constructed aerial target flight infrared dataset
   to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB The uncontrolled dumping of synthetic dyes into water sources has posed
   severe hazards to the ecosystem. For decades, several materials with low
   cost and high efficiency have been investigated for dye degradation.
   Photocatalytic degradation is regarded as a successful strategy since it
   utilizes sunlight to transform harmful pollutants into nontoxic
   compounds without using oxidative agents. The photocatalytic potentials
   of CeO2/g-C3N4 (CG) were investigated in this work using a simplistic
   ultrasonication process. Here, the amount of CeO2 was fixed, and g-C3N4
   was varied in the ratio (1:x, where x = 1, 2, and 3) and abbreviated as
   CG1, CG2, and CG3. Characterization techniques such as Fourier
   transforms-infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA),
   powdered X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, etc. were
   used to characterize structural analysis, optical properties, particle
   size, and chemical bonds of the prepared nanocomposites. The
   photocatalytic results showed that CG2 effectively degraded rose bengal
   (RB) and crystal violet (CV) dyes when exposed to visible light
   irradiation as compared to pure GCN and CeO2. The antibacterial activity
   analysis further supported the potential application of prepared
   photocatalyst as a disinfectant agent against both gram-positive
   (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative
   (Salmonella abony and Escherichia coli) pathogenic strains of bacteria.

AB Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, aiming at
   recommending items according to the behavior of anonymous users.
   Previous research efforts mainly focus on capturing sequential
   transitions between consecutive items via recurrent neural networks
   (RNN) or modeling the complex transitions between non-adjacent items
   based on graph neural networks (GNN). Although these works have achieved
   encouraging performance on solving the session-based recommendation
   problem, few efforts have been dedicated to exploring the rich
   information related to the shifts of user interests within the
   transition relationships, which is the research gap we attempt to bridge
   in this work. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Time
   Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (TE-GNN), which attempts to capture the
   complex user interest shift patterns within sessions. In TE-GNN, we
   construct a Time Enhanced Session Graph (TES-Graph) where transition
   relationships between items are treated adaptively with respect to the
   degree of user interest drift. In addition, a novel Temporal Graph
   Convolutional Network (T-GCN) is designed to learn item embeddings based
   on the TES-Graph. Moreover, we also introduce a Temporal Interest
   Attention Network (TIAN) to model the complex transition of items with a
   common user interest. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four
   widely used benchmark datasets, i.e., Diginetica, Tmall, Nowplaying, and
   Retailrocket, and the results show that our proposed approach TE-GNN
   significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline methods.

AB Person re-identification (ReID) is an important topic of computer
   vision. Existing works in this field focus primarily on learning a
   feature extractor that maps the pedestrian images into a feature space,
   in which feature vectors corresponding to the same identity are close to
   each other. In this paper, we propose the adjacency-aware Graph
   Convolutional Network (AAGCN) to smooth the intra-class features and
   thus reduce the intra-class variance. Specifically, our AAGCN takes the
   features learned by a backbone as the input nodes; it first establishes
   the connections or adjacency relations for the intra-class features,
   then the adjacent nodes (i.e., the intra-class features) would be
   smoothed thanks to the property of low-pass filtering of Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN). In this paper, we propose two methods,
   i.e., the Mahalanobis Neighborhood Adjacency (MNA) and Non-Linear
   Mapping (NLM), to learn the adjacency relations for the intra-class
   features. The MNA defines the adjacency weight between two nodes as the
   negative exponent of the Mahalanobis distance between their
   corresponding features, therefore it aims to learn a small Mahalanobis
   distance between the intra-class features and a large Mahalanobis
   distance between the inter-class ones. The NLM enables the non-linear
   mapping from the features of the nodes to their corresponding adjacency
   weights. The experimental results on both visible ReID and
   visual-infrared ReID verify the effectiveness of our method, for
   instance, our model achieves 95.7% rank-1 and 93.1% mAP on Market1501,
   as well as 58.6% rank-1 and 60.0% mAP on SYSU. (c) 2021 Published by

AB Many fully automatic segmentation models have been created to solve the
   difficulty of brain tumor segmentation, thanks to the rapid growth of
   deep learning. However, few approaches focus on the long-range
   relationships and contextual interdependence in multimodal Magnetic
   Resonance (MR) images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
   brain tumor segmentation called the dual graph reasoning unit (DGRUnit).
   Two parallel graph reasoning modules are included in our proposed
   method: a spatial reasoning module and a channel reasoning module. The
   spatial reasoning module models the long-range spatial dependencies
   between distinct regions in an image using a graph convolutional network
   (GCN). The channel reasoning module uses a graph attention network (GAT)
   to model the rich contextual interdependencies between different
   channels with similar semantic representations. Our experimental results
   clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DGRUnit.
   The ablation study shows the flexibility and generalizability of our
   model, which can be easily integrated into a wide range of neural
   networks and further improve them. When compared to several
   state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that the proposed
   approach significantly improves both visual inspection and quantitative
   metrics for brain tumor segmentation tasks.

AB Hand pose estimation in 3D space from a single RGB image is a highly
   challenging problem due to self-geometric ambiguities, diverse texture,
   viewpoints, and self-occlusions. Existing work proves that a network
   structure with multi-scale resolution subnets, fused in parallel can
   more effectively shows the spatial accuracy of 2D pose estimation.
   Nevertheless, the features extracted by traditional convolutional neural
   networks cannot efficiently express the unique topological structure of
   hand key points based on discrete and correlated properties. Some
   applications of hand pose estimation based on traditional convolutional
   neural networks have demonstrated that the structural similarity between
   the graph and hand key points can improve the accuracy of the 3D hand
   pose regression. In this paper, we design and implement an end-to-end
   network for predicting 3D hand pose from a single RGB image. We first
   extract multiple feature maps from different resolutions and make
   parallel feature fusion, and then model a graph-based convolutional
   neural network module to predict the initial 3D hand key points. Next,
   we use 2D spatial relationships and 3D geometric knowledge to build a
   self-supervised module to eliminate domain gaps between 2D and 3D space.
   Finally, the final 3D hand pose is calculated by averaging the 3D hand
   poses from the GCN output and the self-supervised module output. We
   evaluate the proposed method on two challenging benchmark datasets for
   3D hand pose estimation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of
   our proposed method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
   benchmark datasets.

AB With the development of smart phones, malicious applications for the
   Android platform have increased dramatically. The existing Android
   malicious code analysis methods majorly focus on detection based on
   signatures, inter-component communication, and other configuration
   information features. Such methods ignore the effect of the semantic
   features of the malicious code. Even a few such studies that exist are
   based on the statistical features of the code for malicious code
   detection. To address these shortcomings, we (1) use the code semantic
   structure features to reflect deep semantic information, (2) propose a
   preprocessing method of APK files to generate graphics that reflect the
   code semantic features, and (3) introduce the advanced graphical
   semantics for a graph convolutional network (GCN) model to automatically
   identify and learn semantics and extract features for malicious code
   detection. Experiments on a dataset confirm that the proposed method can
   achieve 95.8% detection accuracy. Compared with the existing methods
   that adopt configuration information features or statistical features of
   codes, our method shows higher accuracy.

AB Background: Lung cancer is cancer with the highest incidence in the
   world, and there is obvious heterogeneity within its tumor. The
   emergence of single-cell sequencing technology allows researchers to
   obtain cell-type-specific expression genes at the single-cell level,
   thereby obtaining information regarding the cell status and
   subpopulation distribution, as well as the communication behavior
   between cells. Many researchers have applied this technology to lung
   cancer research, but due to the shortcomings of insufficient sequencing
   depth, only a small part of the gene expression can be detected.
   Researchers can only roughly compare whether a few thousand genes are
   significant in different cell types. Methods: To fully explore the
   expression of all genes in different cell types, we propose a method to
   predict cell-type-specific genes. This method infers cell-type-specific
   genes based on the expression levels of genes in different tissues and
   cells and gene interactions. At present, biological experiments have
   discovered a large number of cell-type-specific genes, providing a large
   number of available samples for the application of deep learning
   methods. Results: Therefore, we fused Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to build, model, and inferred
   cell-type-specific genes of lung cancer in 8 cell types. Conclusion:
   This method further analyzes and processes single-cell data and provides
   a new basis for research on heterogeneity in lung cancer tumor,
   microenvironment, invasion and metastasis, treatment response, drug
   resistance, etc.

AB Cognitive radio (CR) is a critical technique to solve the conflict
   between the explosive growth of traffic and severe spectrum scarcity.
   Reasonable radio resource allocation with CR can effectively achieve
   spectrum sharing and co-channel interference (CCI) mitigation. In this
   paper, we propose a joint channel selection and power adaptation scheme
   for the underlay cognitive radio network (CRN), maximizing the data rate
   of all secondary users (SUs) while guaranteeing the quality of service
   (QoS) of primary users (PUs). To exploit the underlying topology of
   CRNs, we model the communication network as dynamic graphs, and the
   random walk is used to imitate the users' movements. Considering the
   lack of accurate channel state information (CSI), we use the user
   distance distribution contained in the graph to estimate CSI. Moreover,
   the graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to extract the crucial
   interference features. Further, an end-to-end learning model is designed
   to implement the following resource allocation task to avoid the split
   with mismatched features and tasks. Finally, the deep reinforcement
   learning (DRL) framework is adopted for model learning, to explore the
   optimal resource allocation strategy. The simulation results verify the
   feasibility and convergence of the proposed scheme, and prove that its
   performance is significantly improved.

AB Sea Surface Temperature (SST) prediction is a hot topic that has
   received tremendous popularity in recent years. Existing methods for SST
   prediction usually select one sea area of interest and conduct SST
   prediction by learning the spatial and temporal dependencies and
   patterns in historical SST data. However, global SST is a unified system
   of high regionality, and the SST in different sea areas shows different
   changing patterns due to the influence of various factors, e.g.,
   geographic location, ocean currents and sea depth. Without a good
   understanding of such regionality of SST, we cannot quantitatively
   integrate the regionality information of SST into SST prediction models
   to make them adaptive to different SST patterns around the world and
   improve the prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we proposed the
   Multi-Stage Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MuSTC) method to quantitatively
   identify sea areas with similar SST patterns. First, MuSTC sequentially
   learns the representation of long-term SST with a deep temporal encoder
   and calculates the spatial correlation scores between grid ocean regions
   with self-attention. Then, MuSTC clusters grid ocean regions based on
   the original SST data, encoded long-term SST representation and spatial
   correlation scores, respectively, to obtain the sea areas with similar
   SST patterns from different perspectives. According to the experiments
   in three ocean areas, i.e., the North Pacific Ocean (NPO), the South
   Atlantic Ocean (SAO) and the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO), the clustering
   results generally match the distribution of ocean currents, which
   demonstrates the effectiveness of our MuSTC method. In addition, we
   integrate the clustering results into two representative spatio-temporal
   prediction models, i.e., Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks
   (STGCN) and Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN), to
   conduct SST prediction. According to the results of experiments, the
   integration of regionality information leads to the reduction of Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 1.95%, 1.39% and 1.28% in NPO, SAO and NAO,
   respectively, using the STGCN model, and the reduction of RMSE by 4.94%,
   0.74% and 1.43% by using the AGCRN model. Such results indicate that the
   integration of regionality information could notably improve the
   prediction accuracy of SST.

AB The goal of temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) is to represent
   the entities and relations in a given temporal knowledge graph (TKG) as
   low-dimensional vectors (i.e., embeddings), which preserve both semantic
   information and temporal dynamics of the factual information. In this
   paper, we posit that the intrinsic difficulty of existing TKGE methods
   lies in the lack information in KG snapshots with timestamps, each of
   which contains the facts that co-occur at specific timestamp. To address
   this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised TKGE approach, THOR
   (Three-tower grapH cOnvolution netwoRks (GCNs)), which extracts latent
   knowledge from TKGs by jointly leveraging both temporal and atemporal
   dependencies between entities and the structural dependency between
   relations. THOR learns the embeddings of entities and relations,
   obtained from three-tower GCNs by (1) maximizing the likelihood of the
   facts in a TKG and (2) addressing the lack of information in a TKG based
   on the auxiliary supervision signals each entity. Our experiments on
   three real-world datasets demonstrate that THOR significantly
   outperforms 17 competitors in terms of TKG completion tasks. THOR yields
   up to 9.37% higher accuracy than the best competitor.

AB Identifying the binding residues of protein-peptide complexes is
   essential for understanding protein function mechanisms and exploring
   drug discovery. Recently, many computational methods have been developed
   to predict the interaction sites of either protein or peptide. However,
   to our knowledge, no prediction method can simultaneously identify the
   interaction sites on both the protein and peptide sides. Here, we
   propose a deep graph convolutional network (GCN)-based method called
   GraphPPepIS to predict the interaction sites of protein-peptide
   complexes using protein and peptide structural information. We also
   propose a companion method, SeqPPepIS, for assisting with the lack of
   structural information and the flexibility of peptides. SepPPepIS
   replaces the peptide structural features in GraphPPepIS by learning
   features from peptide sequences. We performed a comprehensive evaluation
   of the benchmark data sets, and the results show that our two methods
   outperform state-of-the-art methods on the accurate interaction sites of
   both protein and peptide sides. We show that our methods can help
   improve protein- peptide docking. For docking data sets, our methods
   maintain robust performance in identifying binding sites, thereby
   enhancing the prediction of peptide binding poses. Finally, we
   visualized the analysis of protein and peptide graph embedding to
   demonstrate the learning ability of graph convolution in predicting
   interaction sites, which was mainly obtained through the shared
   parameters of a protein graph and peptide graph.

AB Accurate and efficient traffic prediction is the key to the realization
   of intelligent transportation system (ITS), which helps to alleviate
   traffic congestion and reduce traffic accidents. Due to the complex
   dynamic spatial-temporal dependence between traffic networks, traffic
   prediction is extremely challenging. In previous studies, convolution
   neural network (CNN) and graph convolution network (GCN) were used to
   model spatial correlation. However, the non-Euclidean correlation of
   road network reduces the effect of convolution operator modeling. In
   addition, only considering the traffic interaction around the concerned
   points simplifies the influence of traffic network. In order to address
   the above problems, this article proposes an end-to-end global
   spatial-temporal graph attention network (GST-GAT), which uses the
   "global interaction + node query" to model the dynamic spatial-temporal
   correlation of traffic. In the encoder, the long short-term memory
   (LSTM) component flexibly transforms the traffic dynamic
   spatial-temporal graph into feedforward differentiable features. Global
   traffic interaction is proposed to summarize traffic network context
   changes and integrate all node features at each moment through a forward
   calculation. Then, each node computes the influence of traffic global
   interaction on a single node in parallel, and the spatial-temporal
   interaction information is adaptive fused by gating fusion mechanism.
   Finally, the end-to-end network structure is used to train the rich
   mixed feature coding to generate the traffic prediction status of each
   node. Experiments on public transportation data sets show that GST-GAT
   performs better than previous work in terms of accuracy and inference
   speed.

AB Due to the harmful impact of fabricated information on social media,
   many rumor verificationtechniques have been introduced in recent years.
   Advanced techniques like multi-task learning(MTL), shared-private models
   suffer from many strategic limitations that restrict their capabilityof
   veracity identification on social media. These models are often reliant
   on multiple tasksfor the primary targeted objective. Even the most

AB Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, annotated by
   cell type, is useful in a variety of downstream biological applications,
   such as profiling gene expression at the single-cell level. However,
   manually assigning these annotations with known marker genes is both
   time-consuming and subjective.Results: We present a Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN)-based approach to automate the annotation process. Our
   process builds upon existing labeling approaches, using state-of-the-art
   tools to find cells with highly confident label assignments through
   consensus and spreading these confident labels with a semi-supervised
   GCN. Using simulated data and two scRNA-seq datasets from different
   tissues, we show that our method improves accuracy over a simple
   consensus algorithm and the average of the underlying tools. We also
   compare our method to a nonparametric neighbor majority approach,
   showing comparable results. We then demonstrate that our GCN method
   allows for feature interpretation, identifying important genes for cell
   type classification. We present our completed pipeline, written in
   PyTorch, as an end-to-end tool for automating and interpreting the

AB Solvent effects are notoriously difficult to describe for metallic
   nanoparticles (NPs). Here, we introduce GAL21 which is the first
   pairwise additive force field that is specifically designed to modulate
   the near chemisorption energy of water as a function of the coordination
   numbers of the metallic atoms. We find a quadratic dependence to be most
   suitable for capturing the dependence of the adsorption energy of water
   on the generalized coordination number (GCN) of the metal atoms. GAL21
   has been fitted against DFT adsorption energies for Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd,
   Pt, and Co on 500 configurations and validated on about 3000
   configurations for each metal, constructed on five surfaces with GCNs
   varying from 2.5 to 11.25. Depending on the metals, the root mean square
   deviation is found between 0.7 kcal mol(-1) (Au) to 1.6 kcal mol(-1)
   (Ni). Using GAL21, as implemented in the open-source code CP2K, we then
   evaluate the solvation energy of Au-55 and Pt-55 NPs in water using
   thermodynamic integration. The solvation free energy is found to be
   larger for Pt than for Au and systematically larger than 200 kcal
   mol(-1), demonstrating the large impact of solvent on the surface
   energetics of NPs. Still, given that the amorphous NPs are both, the
   most stable and the most solvated ones, we do not predict a change in
   the preferred morphology between the gas-phase and in water. Finally,

AB High-precision water quality prediction plays a vital role in preventing
   and controlling river pollution. However, river water's highly nonlinear
   and complex spatio-temporal dependencies pose significant challenges to
   water quality prediction tasks. In order to capture the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of water quality data simultaneously, this
   paper combines deep learning algorithms for river water quality
   prediction in the river network area of Jiangnan Plain, China. A water
   quality prediction method based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and
   long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), namely spatio-temporal
   graph convolutional network model (ST-GCN), is proposed. Specifically,
   the spatio-temporal graph is constructed based on the spatio-temporal
   correlation between river stations, the spatial features in the river
   network are extracted using GCN, and the temporal correlation of water
   quality data is obtained by integrating LSTM. The model was evaluated
   using R-2, MAE, and RMSE, and the experimental results were 0.977,
   0.238, and 0.291, respectively. Compared with traditional regression
   models and general deep learning models, this model has significantly
   improved prediction accuracy, better stability, and generalization
   ability. The ST-GCN model can achieve high-precision water quality
   prediction in different river sections and provide technical support for
   water environment management.

AB Video captioning aims at automatically generating a natural language
   caption to describe the content of a video. However, most of the
   existing methods in the video captioning task ignore the relationship
   between objects in the video and the correlation between multimodal
   features, and they also ignore the effect of caption length on the task.
   This study proposes a novel video captioning framework (ORMF) based on
   the object relation graph and multimodal feature fusion. ORMF uses the
   similarity and Spatio-temporal relationship of objects in video to
   construct object relation features graph and introduce graph convolution
   network (GCN) to encode the object relation. At the same time, ORMF also
   constructs a multimodal features fusion network to learn the
   relationship between different modal features. The multimodal feature
   fusion network is used to fuse the features of different modals.
   Furthermore, the proposed model calculates the length loss of the
   caption, making the caption get richer information. The experimental
   results on two public datasets (Microsoft video captioning corpus [MSVD]
   and Microsoft research-video to text [MSR-VTT]) demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our method.

AB Pose estimation in crowded scenes is key to understanding human behavior
   in real-life applications. Most existing CNN-based pose estimation
   methods often depend on the appearance of visible parts as cues to
   localize human joints. However, occlusion is typical in crowded scenes,
   and invisible body parts have no valid features for joint localization.
   Introducing prior information about the human pose structure to infer
   the locations of occluded parts is a natural solution to this problem.
   In this paper, we argue that learning structural information based on
   human joints alone is not enough to address human body variations and
   could be prone to overfitting. From a perspective on the human pose as a
   dual representation of joints and limbs, we propose a pose refinement
   network, coined as dual graph network (DGN), to jointly learn its
   structural information of body joints and limbs by incorporating the
   cooperative constraints between two branches. Specifically, our DGN has
   two coupled graph convolutional network (GCN) branches to model the
   structure information of joints and limbs. Each stage in the branch is
   composed of a feature aggregator and a GCN module for inter-branch
   information fusion and intra-branch context extraction, respectively. In
   addition, to enhance the modeling capacity of GCN, we design an adaptive
   GCN layer (AGL) embedded in the GCN module to handle each pose instance
   based on its graph structure. We also propose a heatmap-guided sampling
   to leverage the features of the body parts to provide rich visual
   features for the inference of occluded parts. We perform extensive
   experiments on five challenging datasets to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our DGN on pose estimation. Our DGN obtains significant
   performance improvement from 67.9 to 72.4 mAP in the CrowdPose dataset
   with the same CNN-based pose estimator and training strategy as the
   OPEC-Net. It shows that, compared to the OPEC-Net only considering
   joints, our DGN has a clear advantage due to the joint consideration of
   both joints and limbs. Meanwhile, our DGN is also helpful for pose
   estimation in general datasets (i.e., COCO and Pose track) with less
   occlusion and mutual interference, demonstrating the generalization
   power of DGN on refining human poses.

AB Predicting the future price trends of stocks is a challenging yet
   intriguing problem given its critical role to help investors make
   profitable decisions. In this paper, we present a collaborative
   temporal-relational modeling framework for end-to-end stock trend
   prediction. Different from existing studies relying on the pairwise
   correlations between stocks, we argue that stocks are naturally
   connected as a collective group, and introduce two heterogeneous
   hypergraphs to separately characterize the stock group-wise
   re-lationships of industry-belonging and fund-holding. A novel
   hypergraph tri-attention network (HGTAN) is proposed to augment the
   hypergraph convolutional networks with a hierarchical organization of
   intra-hyperedge, inter-hyperedge, and inter-hypergraph attention
   modules. In this manner, HGTAN adaptively determines the importance of
   nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraphs during the information propagation
   among stocks, so that the potential synergies between stock movements
   can be fully exploited. Experi-mental evaluation and investment
   simulation on real-world stock data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time series imputation is essential for real-world applications. Though
   the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Graph
   Convolution Networks (GCNs) provides more possibilities to improve
   imputation performance, how to achieve the optimal latent code and
   precisely model the properties of incomplete time series remain a
   challenge. In GAN-based methods, an effective latent code of incomplete
   time series is necessary for precise reconstruc-tion. To acquire the
   optimal latent code, we introduce GAN inversion to invert the input to
   the latent space of a pretrained GAN. The inverted latent code contains
   rich properties of original observations and thus can better reconstruct
   the target sample. To model the temporal irregu-larity due to the
   presence of missing values, the decay connection is exploited to
   quantify the influence that dependencies between adjacent observations
   should decrease as the time lags between them increase. We incorporate
   the quantification into the adjacent matrix of the GCN to better
   aggregate adjacent information of incomplete time series. With the
   adoption of decay connection, the resulting latent code through GAN
   inversion can further produce faithful reconstruction. Quantitative and
   qualitative experiments conducted on several time series data -sets show
   that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art or competitive imputation
   performance.

AB With the advent of deep learning algorithms, fully automated
   radiological image analysis is within reach. In spine imaging, several
   atlas- and shape-based as well as deep learning segmentation algorithms
   have been proposed, allowing for subsequent automated analysis of
   morphology and pathology. The first "Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation
   Challenge" (VerSe 2019) showed that these perform well on normal
   anatomy, but fail in variants not frequently present in the training
   dataset. Building on that experience, we report on the largely increased
   VerSe 2020 dataset and results from the second iteration of the VerSe
   challenge (MICCAI 2020, Lima, Peru). VerSe 2020 comprises annotated
   spine computed tomography (CT) images from 300 subjects with 4142 fully
   visualized and annotated vertebrae, collected across multiple centres
   from four different scanner manufacturers, enriched with cases that
   exhibit anatomical variants such as enumeration abnormalities (n = 77)
   and transitional vertebrae (n = 161). Metadata includes vertebral
   labelling information, voxel-level segmentation masks obtained with a
   human-machine hybrid algorithm and anatomical ratings, to enable the
   development and benchmarking of robust and accurate segmentation
   algorithms.

AB Node classification for highly imbalanced graph data is challenging,
   with existing graph neural networks (GNNs) typically utilizing a
   balanced class distribution to learn node embeddings on graph data.
   However, when dealing with an imbalanced class distribution, they tend
   to bias the nodes of the majority classes while the nodes of the
   minority classes are under-represented. To overcome this challenge, this
   work introduces a novel GNN-based Imbalanced Node Classification Model
   (GNNINCM) that is appropriate for class-imbalanced graph data,
   comprising two cooperative modules: Embedding Clustering-based
   Optimization (ECO) and Graph Reconstruction-based Optimization (GRO).
   ECO first employs a two-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) to
   obtain node embeddings and then performs clustering analysis to enhance
   the representative nature of the node embeddings and ease
   classification. Moreover, GRO employs an inner product decoder to
   reconstruct graph structure and minimize information loss. In
   particular, we design a hard sample strategy and integrate it into ECO
   and GRO to ensure that the embeddings of the hard nodes are correctly
   represented. Furthermore, we propose a Hard Sample-based Knowledge
   Distillation Method (HSKDM) to train multiple GNNINCM models
   simultaneously and improve the overall classification performance.
   Experiments on three well-known class-imbalanced graph datasets
   demonstrate that GNN-INCM outperforms current stateof-the-art methods in
   node classification tasks and that HSKDM can substantially improve the
   overall classification performance. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The study of cosmic gamma ray bursts (GRBs) is one of the main goals of
   the Lomonosov space mission. The main advantage of this mission is
   simultaneous multiwavelength observations of GRBs covering the optical,
   X-ray and gamma-ray ranges. The mission payload includes the GRB monitor
   BDRG, wide-field optical cameras SHOK, and the UFFO instrument. Data are
   recorded mainly by the event trigger provided by the BDRG instrument,
   which measures the spectral and temporal properties of the burst in the
   energy range 10-3000 keV. The BDRG instrument also provides estimation
   of the source coordinates by comparing the readings of three differently
   directed detectors with an accuracy of several degrees. Wide-field SHOK
   optical cameras have a field of view of 20A degrees x 40A degrees. They
   fix a set of images with a frequency of about five frames per second
   prior to the trigger and another set immediately after the trigger. The
   UFFO instrument includes the UBAT telescope with a coded mask for
   measurements in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray ranges and an optical
   telescope with a slewing mirror (SMT) that can be directed on the GRB
   source for a time 1 s for measuring GRB prompt emission in the early
   stages. In response to an BDRG trigger signal, the real-time data on a
   detected GRB are transmitted to the Earth via Globalstar network to the
   Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN) and ground-based observatories.
   During observations on the Lomonosov satellite, 20 gamma-ray bursts were
   detected and catalogued. Several gamma-ray bursts were also detected in
   the Vernov satellite experiment. An example of such an event is given.

AB Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in
   intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of
   traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic
   temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately.
   Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the
   interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep,
   the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple
   nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates
   shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which
   limits their representation competence and declines their power in
   capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent
   breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power
   of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data,
   this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural
   network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We
   integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision
   provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model
   generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation
   and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are
   constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as
   similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and
   self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic
   temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on
   three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time)
   using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms
   the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results.

AB The representation of 3D data is the key issue for shape analysis.
   However, most of the existing representations suffer from high
   computational cost and structure information loss. This paper presents a
   novel sequential slice representation with an attention-embedding
   network, named RSSNet, for 3D point cloud recognition and retrieval in
   road environments. RSSNet has two main branches. Firstly, a sequential
   slice module is designed to map disordered 3D point clouds to ordered
   sequence of shallow feature vectors. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) module
   is applied to encode the spatial and content information of these
   sequential vectors. The second branch consists of a key-point based
   graph convolution network (GCN) with an embedding attention strategy to
   fuse the sequential and global features to refine the structure
   discriminability. Three datasets were used to evaluate the proposed
   method, one acquired by our mobile laser scanning (MLS) system and two
   public datasets (KITTI and Sydney Urban Objects). Experimental results
   indicated that the proposed method achieved better performance than
   recognition and retrieval state-of-the-art methods. RSSNet provided

AB In recent years, convolution neural networks (CNNs) and graph
   convolution networks (GCNs) have been widely used in hyperspectral image
   classification (HSIC). CNNs can effectively extract the spatial spectral
   features of hyperspectral images (HSIs), while GCNs can quickly capture
   the structural features of HSIs, which makes the effective combination
   of the two is beneficial to improve classification performance of
   hyperspectral images. However, the high redundancy of feature
   information and the problem of small sample are still the major
   challenges of HSIC. In order to alleviate these problems, in this paper,
   a new graph and double pyramid attention network based on linear
   discrimination of spectral interclass slices (GDPA_LDSICS) is proposed.
   First, a linear discrimination of spectral inter class slices (LDSICS)
   module is designed. The LDSICS module can effectively eliminate a lot of
   redundancy in spectral dimension, which is conducive to subsequent
   feature extraction. Then, the spatial spectral deformation (SSD) module
   is constructed, which can effectively correlate the spatial spectral
   information closely. Finally, in order to alleviate the problem of small
   sample, a double branch structure of CNN and GCN is developed. On the
   CNN branch, a double pyramid attention (DPA) structure is designed to
   model context semantics to avoid information loss caused by
   long-distance feature extraction. On the GCN branch, an adaptive dynamic
   encoding (ADE) method is proposed, which can more effectively capture
   the topological structure of spatial spectral features. Experiments on
   four open datasets show that the GDPA_LDSICS can provide better
   classification performance and generalization performance than other
   most advanced methods.

AB Water Cherenkov detectors like Super-Kamiokande, and the next generation
   Hyper-Kamiokande are adding gadolinium to their water to improve the
   detection of neutrons. By detecting neutrons in addition to the leptons
   in neutrino interactions, an improved separation between neutrino and
   anti-neutrinos, and reduced backgrounds for proton decay searches can be
   expected. The neutron signal itself is still small and can be confused
   with muon spallation and other background sources. In this paper,
   machine learning techniques are employed to optimize the neutron capture
   detection capability in the new intermediate water Cherenkov detector
   (IWCD) for Hyper-K. In particular, boosted decision tree (XGBoost),
   graph convolutional network (GCN), and dynamic graph convolutional
   neural network (DGCNN) models are developed and benchmarked against a
   statistical likelihood-based approach, achieving up to a 10% increase in
   classification accuracy. Characteristic features are also engineered
   from the datasets and analyzed using SHAP (SHapley Additive
   exPlanations) to provide insight into the pivotal factors influencing
   event type outcomes. The dataset used in this research consisted of
   roughly 1.6 million simulated particle gun events, divided nearly evenly
   between neutron capture and a background electron source. The current
   samples used for training are representative only, and more realistic
   samples will need to be made for the analyses of real data. The current
   class split is 50/50, but there is expected to be a difference between
   the classes in the real experiment, and one might consider using
   resampling techniques to address the issue of serious imbalances in the
   class distribution in real data if necessary.

AB Due to the interaction of many factors in the stock market, stock price
   prediction has always been a challenging problem in the field of machine
   learning. In particular, the mutation factors of the stock market often
   have a great impact on subsequent predictions. The existing prediction
   models seldom consider the impacts of other stocks in the stock market
   and mutation points on the prediction accuracy of target stocks.
   Therefore, this paper presents a new knowledge graph and deep learning
   method combined with a stock price prediction network focusing on
   related stocks and mutation points. First, the target stock price
   features are obtained through the ConvLSTM network. Second, the
   knowledge graph is used to mine the hidden relationships between stocks
   to find the stocks relevant to the target stock to obtain the market
   information vector and the market information features through the
   ConvLSTM network. Then, we find the mutation points according to the
   price change range, construct the mutation point distance weight matrix
   according to the distance from each trading day to the mutation points,
   and obtain the mutation point information features through the graph
   convolutional network (GCN). Finally, the features of market
   information, mutation point information and target stock price are fused
   to jointly predict the future stock price. The experimental results on
   the A share of Shenzhen from 2010 to 2019 show that the algorithm has
   good robustness and that the prediction accuracy is effectively
   improved. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

AB Conventionally, cold-start limitations are managed by leveraging side
   information such as social-trust relationships. However, the
   relationships between users in social networks are complex, uncertain,
   and sparse. Therefore, it is necessary to extract beneficial social
   connections to make the recommendation models cold-start resistant.
   Towards this end, we propose a novel recommendation model called
   Variational Cold-start Resistant Recommendation (CORE-VAE). More
   concretely, we employ a social-aware similarity function and a graph
   convolutional network (GCN) to generate robust social-aware user
   representations that account for the complexities, uncertainties, and
   sparse nature of the social-trust network. Subsequently, these powerful
   social-aware representations aid us in producing cold-start resistant
   rating vectors for all users. To explore the rich user rating
   information, we propose an expressive variational autoencoder (VAE)
   model. Unlike earlier VAE-based CF models, CORE-VAE utilizes a novel
   prior distribution and a well-designed skip-generative network to
   alleviate the posterior collapse issue considerably. Besides, CORE-VAE
   can also capture the latent space's uncertainty and ensure that
   observations and their accompanying latent variables have high mutual
   information. Overall, these novel techniques dramatically help produce
   better latent representations for generating more accurate
   recommendations. We show that CORE-VAE outperforms numerous competitive
   baseline models on real-world datasets through comprehensive empirical
   evaluation and analysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Region-level passenger demand prediction plays an important role in the
   coordination of travel demand and supply in the urban public
   transportation system. The complex urban road network structure leads to
   irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge
   for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in
   different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community
   spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC_STGCN) framework to
   predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring
   spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated
   recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in
   regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among
   regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional
   network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity
   graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used
   to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two
   real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City
   are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show
   that the MC_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series
   prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to
   better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further
   discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal
   correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community
   detection compared with random classification of regions, and the
   advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based
   prediction models.

AB In this study, novel core-shell catalyst with a new ternary
   heterostructure was synthesized (Fe-0@POCN/CQDs) for the degradation of
   tetracycline (TC). The TEM results showed that the Fe-0 particles were
   wrapped in POCN material and many nano CQDs were uniformly dispersed in
   the material. The new ternary nanocomposite exhibits excellent
   photocatalytic activity for the removal of TC, which was approximately
   4.76 times higher than that of GCN. The enhancement of photocatalytic
   activity was attributed to the effective heterojunction as well as the
   multiply synergistic effects of POCN combined with Fe-0 and CQDs, which
   was beneficial for retardation of recombination rate of photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs and generation of more free radicals for the
   oxidation of TC. Besides, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) of h(+),
   center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH played pivotal roles in the
   degradation of TC by Fe-0@POCN/CQDs during the photocatalytic reaction.
   At the same times, sulfate radical (SOT) and hydroxyl radical (center
   dot OH) highlighted the dominant role in the degradation process
   compared with other free radicals under persulfate hybrid mixture system
   (PS system), which was further confirmed by radical scavenger
   experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis. The response
   surface methodology (RSM) study indicated that the optimal removal
   parameters of tetracycline could reach 97.57% within 30 min under PS
   system. In addition, the possible degradation pathway intermediates of
   TC were studied by HPLC-MS and the reaction catalytic activity mechanism
   of Fe-0@POCN/CQDs/persulfate system was discussed. (C) 2020 Published by

AB Understanding human intentions during interactions has been a
   long-lasting theme, that has applications in human-robot interaction,
   virtual reality and surveillance. In this study, we focus on full-body
   human interactions with large-sized daily objects and aim to predict the
   future states of objects and humans given a sequential observation of
   human-object interaction. As there is no such dataset dedicated to
   full-body human interactions with large-sized daily objects, we
   collected a large-scale dataset containing thousands of interactions for
   training and evaluation purposes. We also observe that an object's
   intrinsic physical properties are useful for the object motion
   prediction, and thus design a set of object dynamic descriptors to
   encode such intrinsic properties. We treat the object dynamic
   descriptors as a new modality and propose a graph neural network,
   HO-GCN, to fuse motion data and dynamic descriptors for the prediction
   task. We show the proposed network that consumes dynamic descriptors can
   achieve state-of-the-art prediction results and help the network better
   generalize to unseen objects. We also demonstrate the predicted results
   are useful for human-robot collaborations.

AB Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA), which allows the target domain to
   store invisible class samples in the source domain, has recently
   received significant attention. In this paper, we propose a new
   unsupervised OSDA classification framework using an evidential network
   and multi-binary classifier and consider their jointly selected samples
   as a pseudo-labelled sample set of an unknown class. Specifically, this
   study designed an evidential network based on the D-S evidence theory to
   predict the degree of belief that a sample belongs to an unknown class.
   By selecting samples with high -uncertainty, false positive samples can
   be removed, which improves the reliability of unknown sample selection.
   Then, to better explore the intra-class relationship, an open-set graph
   convolutional network (OSGC) is proposed to extract distinguishable
   features of known and unknown samples in a weighted adversarial
   adaptation manner. Moreover, this paper presents a graph collaborative
   learning strategy to retrain the unknown recognition module (URM) with
   high confidence pseudo-labelled samples, which is predicted by the graph
   convolution network (GCN), where the target known class distribution is
   learned. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
   state-of-the-art OSDA algorithms on three benchmark datasets and
   maintains a high recognition accuracy for unknown classes over a wide
   range of openness. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Proteins are the essential biological macromolecules required to perform
   nearly all biological processes, and cellular functions. Proteins rarely
   carry out their tasks in isolation but interact with other proteins
   (known as protein-protein interaction) present in their surroundings to
   complete biological activities. The knowledge of protein-protein
   interactions (PPIs) unravels the cellular behavior and its
   functionality. The computational methods automate the prediction of PPI
   and are less expensive than experimental methods in terms of resources
   and time. So far, most of the works on PPI have mainly focused on
   sequence information. Here, we use graph convolutional network (GCN) and
   graph attention network (GAT) to predict the interaction between
   proteins by utilizing protein's structural information and sequence
   features. We build the graphs of proteins from their PDB files, which
   contain 3D coordinates of atoms. The protein graph represents the amino
   acid network, also known as residue contact network, where each node is
   a residue. Two nodes are connected if they have a pair of atoms (one
   from each node) within the threshold distance. To extract the
   node/residue features, we use the protein language model. The input to
   the language model is the protein sequence, and the output is the
   feature vector for each amino acid of the underlying sequence. We
   validate the predictive capability of the proposed graph-based approach
   on two PPI datasets: Human and S. cerevisiae. Obtained results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as it outperforms
   the previous leading methods. The source code for training and data to
   train the model are available at
   https://github.com/JhaKanchan15/PPI_GNN.git.

AB Relation extraction is a necessary step in obtaining information from
   clinical medical records. In the medical domain, there have been several
   studies on relation extraction in modern medicine clinical notes written
   in English. However, very limited relation extraction research has been
   conducted on clinical notes written in Chinese, especially traditional
   Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical records (e.g., herb-symptom,
   herb-disease). Instead of independently extracting each relation from a
   single sentence or text, we propose to globally and reasonably extract
   multiple types of relations from the Chines clinical records with a
   novel heterogeneous graph representation learning method. Specifically,
   we first construct multiple view medical entity graphs based on the
   co-occurring relations, knowledge obtained from the clinic, and domain
   texts with the corresponding information of two medical entities from
   the Chinese clinical records, in which each edge is a candidate
   relation; we then build a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based
   representation learning with the attention mechanism to simultaneously
   infer the existence of all the edges via classification. The
   experimental data were obtained from the Chinese medical records and
   literature provided by previous work. The main experimental results on
   Chinese clinical records show that our proposed model's precision,
   recall, and F1-score reach 10.2%, 13.5%, 12.6%, demonstrating
   significant improvements over state-of-the-art.

AB In this study, we address the problems encountered by incremental face
   clustering. Without the benefit of having observed the entire data
   distribution, incremental face clustering is more challenging than
   static dataset clustering. Conventional methods rely on the statistical
   information of previous clusters to improve the efficiency of
   incremental clustering; thus, error accumulation may occur. Therefore,
   this study proposes to predict the summaries of previous data directly
   from data distribution via supervised learning. Moreover, an efficient
   framework to cluster previous summaries with new data is explored.
   Although learning summaries from original data costs more than those
   from previous clusters, the entire framework consumes just a little bit
   more time because clustering current data and generating summaries for
   new data share most of the calculations. Experiments show that the
   proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing incremental
   face clustering methods, as evidenced by the improvement of average
   F-score from 0.644 to 0.762. Compared with state-of-the-art static face
   clustering methods, our method can yield comparable accuracy while
   consuming much less time.

AB Streamflow forecasting over gauged and ungauged basins play a vital role
   in water resources planning, especially under the changing climate.
   Increased availability of large sample hydrology data sets, together
   with recent advances in deep learning techniques, has presented new
   opportunities to explore temporal and spatial patterns in hydrological
   signatures for improving streamflow forecasting. The purpose of this
   study is to adapt and benchmark several state-of-the-art graph neural
   network (GNN) architectures, including ChebNet, Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN), and GraphWaveNet, for end-to-end graph learning. We
   explicitly represent river basins as nodes in a graph, learn the
   spatiotemporal nodal dependencies, and then use the learned relations to
   predict streamflow simultaneously across all nodes in the graph. The
   efficacy of the developed GNN models is investigated using the Catchment
   Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set
   under two settings, fixed graph topology (transductive learning), and
   variable graph topology (inductive learning), with the latter applicable
   to prediction in ungauged basins (PUB). Results indicate that GNNs are
   generally robust and computationally efficient, achieving similar or
   better performance than a baseline model trained using the long
   short-term memory (LSTM) network. Further analyses are conducted to
   interpret the graph learning process at the edge and node levels and to
   investigate the effect of different model configurations. We conclude
   that graph learning constitutes a viable machine learning-based method
   for aggregating spatiotemporal information from a multitude of sources
   for streamflow forecasting

AB Ovarian carcinomas (OCs) represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasms
   consisting of several entities with pathogenesis, molecular profiles,
   multiple risk factors, and outcomes. OC has been regarded as the most
   lethal cancer among women all around the world. There are at least five
   main types of OCs classified by the fifth edition of the World Health
   Organization of tumors: high-/low-grade serous carcinoma, mucinous
   carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. With the
   improved knowledge of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and
   expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses, the knowledge of
   genomic landscape of complex diseases has been uncovered in large
   measure. Moreover, pathway analyses also play an important role in
   exploring the underlying mechanism of complex diseases by providing
   curated pathway models and information about molecular dynamics and
   cellular processes. To investigate OCs deeper, we introduced a novel
   disease susceptible gene prediction method, XGBG, which could be used in
   identifying OC-related genes based on different omics data and deep
   learning methods. We first employed the graph convolutional network
   (GCN) to reconstruct the gene features based on both gene feature and
   network topological structure. Then, a boosting method is utilized to
   predict OC susceptible genes. As a result, our model achieved a high AUC
   of 0.7541 and an AUPR of 0.8051, which indicates the effectiveness of
   the XGPG. Based on the newly predicted OC susceptible genes, we gathered
   and researched related literatures to provide strong support to the
   results, which may help in understanding the pathogenesis and mechanisms
   of the disease.

AB Forecasting the trajectories of neighbor vehicles is a crucial step for
   decision making and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. This paper
   proposes a graph-based spatial-temporal convolutional network (GSTCN) to
   predict future trajectory distributions of all neighbor vehicles using
   past trajectories. This network tackles spatial interactions using a
   graph convolutional network (GCN), and captures temporal features with a
   convolutional neural network (CNN). The spatial-temporal features are
   encoded and decoded by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to generate
   future trajectory distributions. Besides, we propose a weighted
   adjacency matrix to describe the intensities of mutual influence between
   vehicles, and the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our
   scheme. Our network is evaluated on two real-world freeway trajectory
   datasets: I-80 and US-101 in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM).
   Comparisons in three aspects, including prediction errors, model sizes,
   and inference speeds, show that our network can achieve state-of-the-art
   performance.

AB Network representation learning endeavors to learn low-dimensional dense
   representations for nodes in a network. With the rapid development of
   online social platforms, the analysis of social networks has become
   increasingly significant. Although network representation learning can
   facilitate the social network analysis, most existing algorithms merely
   exploit the explicit structure among nodes to obtain the node
   representations. Besides, traditional network representation learning
   techniques ignore the influence of nodes in a network when generating
   the representations of nodes. Motivated by this, we innovatively propose
   an influence-aware graph neural network (IAGNN) framework, which can
   learn the latent feature representations of nodes by incorporating both
   node influence and global structure information into the embedding
   process for encoding graph-structured data. The generated
   low-dimensional dense representations of the nodes in a network can be
   used for subsequent tasks such as user classification and user behavior
   prediction. Specifically, we assign different weights to each node
   according to different types of topology between their neighbors, and
   integrate with the basic influence of each node to generate an
   intermediate matrix with influence information. The intermediate matrix
   is encoded into low-dimensional and dense vector spaces by leveraging
   the attention mechanism and the graph convolution operation. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on five datasets, and IAGNN achieves an
   average accuracy of 3% higher than the comparison algorithms on the node
   classification and link prediction tasks. The experimental results
   demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform the
   state-of-the-art network embedding methods such as GCN, GAT, GraphSage,
   AGNN on node classification and link prediction tasks. (c) 2021 Elsevier

AB Cumulative experimental studies have demonstrated the critical roles of
   microRNAs (miRNAs) in the diverse fundamental and important biological
   processes, and in the development of numerous complex human diseases.
   Thus, exploring the relationships between miRNAs and diseases is helpful
   with understanding the mechanisms, the detection, diagnosis, and
   treatment of complex diseases. As the identification of miRNA-disease
   associations via traditional biological experiments is time-consuming
   and expensive, an effective computational prediction method is
   appealing. In this study, we present a deep learning framework with
   variational graph auto-encoder for miRNA-disease association prediction
   (VGAE-MDA). VGAE-MDA first gets the representations of miRNAs and
   diseases from the heterogeneous networks constructed by miRNA-miRNA
   similarity, disease-disease similarity, and known miRNA-disease
   associations. Then, VGAE-MDA constructs two sub-networks: miRNA-based
   network and disease-based network. Combining the representations based
   on the heterogeneous network, two variational graph auto-encoders (VGAE)
   are deployed for calculating the miRNA-disease association scores from
   two subnetworks, respectively. Lastly, VGAE-MDA obtains the final
   predicted association score for a miRNA-disease pair by integrating the
   scores from these two trained networks. Unlike the previous model, the
   VGAE-MDA can mitigate the effect of noises from random selection of
   negative samples. Besides, the use of graph convolutional neural (GCN)
   network can naturally incorporate the node features from the graph
   structure while the variational autoencoder (VAE) makes use of latent
   variables to predict associations from the perspective of data
   distribution. The experimental results show that VGAE-MDA outperforms
   the state-of-the-art approaches in miRNA-disease association prediction.
   Besides, the effectiveness of our model has been further demonstrated by
   case studies.

AB Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a prerequisite guarantee for the
   realization of intelligent transportation, but due to the complex
   spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic flow, its forecasting has
   always been difficult. Deep learning can learn the deep spatiotemporal
   characteristics of traffic flow from a large amount of data. Deep
   learning can learn the deep spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic
   flow from a large amount of data. This paper establishes a novel
   combination forecasting model GGCN-SA based on deep learning for traffic
   flow to effectively capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of
   traffic flow and improve forecasting accuracy. The model captures the
   spatial correlation of the road traffic network through the graph
   convolutional network (GCN), captures the time dependence of the traffic
   flow through the gated recursive unit (GRU), and further introduces the
   soft attention mechanism (Soft Attention) to aggregate different
   neighborhoods Spatio-temporal information within the range to enhance
   the model's ability to characterize the temporal and spatial
   characteristics of traffic flow. A large number of experiments have been
   conducted on the METR-LA and SZ-taxi data sets. The experimental results
   show that the GGCN-SA model proposed in this paper has better
   forecasting performance compared with the baseline methods.

AB Determining the properties of chemical molecules is essential for
   screening candidates similar to a specific drug. These candidate
   molecules are further evaluated for their target binding affinities,
   side effects, target missing probabilities, etc. Conventional machine
   learning algorithms demonstrated satisfying prediction accuracies of
   molecular properties. A molecule cannot be directly loaded into a
   machine learning model, and a set of engineered features needs to be
   designed and calculated from a molecule. Such hand-crafted features rely
   heavily on the experiences of the investigating researchers. The concept
   of graph neural networks (GNNs) was recently introduced to describe the
   chemical molecules. The features may be automatically and objectively
   extracted from the molecules through various types of GNNs, e.g., GCN
   (graph convolution network), GGNN (gated graph neural network), DMPNN
   (directed message passing neural network), etc. However, the training of
   a stable GNN model requires a huge number of training samples and a
   large amount of computing power, compared with the conventional machine
   learning strategies. This study proposed the integrated framework
   XGraphBoost to extract the features using a GNN and build an accurate
   prediction model of molecular properties using the classifier XGBoost.
   The proposed framework XGraphBoost fully inherits the merits of the
   GNN-based automatic molecular feature extraction and XGBoost-based
   accurate prediction performance. Both classification and regression
   problems were evaluated using the framework XGraphBoost. The
   experimental results strongly suggest that XGraphBoost may facilitate
   the efficient and accurate predictions of various molecular properties.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder that
   affects the social abilities of patients. Studies have shown that a
   small number of abnormal functional connections (FCs) exist in the
   cerebral hemisphere of ASD patients. The identification of these
   abnormal FCs provides a biological ground for the diagnosis of ASD. In
   this paper, we propose a combined deep feature selection (DFS) and graph
   convolutional network method to classify ASD. Firstly, in the DFS
   process, a sparse one-to-one layer is added between the input and the
   first hidden layer of a multilayer perceptron, thus each functional
   connection (FC) feature can be weighted and a subset of FC features can
   be selected accordingly. Then based on the selected FCs and the
   phenotypic information of subjects, a graph convolutional network is
   constructed to classify ASD and typically developed controls. Finally,
   we test our proposed method on the ABIDE database and compare it with
   some other methods in the literature. Experimental results indicate that
   the DFS can effectively select critical FC features for classification
   according to the weights of input FC features. With DFS, the performance
   of GCN classifier can be improved dramatically. The proposed method
   achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 79.5% and an
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85 on
   the preprocessed ABIDE dataset; it is superior to the other methods.
   Further studies on the top-ranked thirty FCs obtained by DFS show that
   these FCs are widespread over the cerebral hemisphere, and the ASD group
   appears a significantly higher number of weak connections compared to
   the typically developed group.

AB As an essential part of the modern intelligent traffic management
   system, traffic speed prediction is a challenging task. In recent
   studies, deep neural networks (LSTM and WaveNet) and graph neural
   networks (GCN and GNN) have been extensively investigated on traffic
   networks evaluation, which is better than statistical-based models (MA
   and ARIMA). However, the demerits existing in these deep learning
   forecasting process include (1) carry out vehicle speed as an individual
   input and insufficient ability to handle the other related factors, such
   as the number of equivalent lanes, accident occurrence, and toll data;
   (2) inadequate capability of considering both linear and nonlinear
   components as a whole; (3) unstable performance on forecasting task
   given various heterogeneous series. Therefore, we propose a hybrid
   end-to-end model to combine both spatio-temporal features and other
   effective features. First, a heterogeneous graph attention network
   approach (HetGAT) was proposed, and a temporal dilated convolution
   architecture (TCN) was adopted to simulate the impacts on traffic flow
   of the multi-scale context of temporal factors. Then, a weighted graph
   attention network (GAT) encodes input temporal features, and a decoder
   predicts the output speed sequence via a freeway network structure.
   Based on the end-to-end architecture, we integrate multiple
   Spatio-temporal factors effectively for the prediction. To validate the
   efficiency of the proposed model, three sets of field-captured data were
   employed to run the test. Compared with conventional sequence analysis
   models and deep prediction models, experimental results demonstrated the
   superiority of HetGAT for all cases with regards to MAE, MAPE, and RMSE.

AB In this paper, we derived a high-efficiency formula for calculating the
   precision of carrier phase relative positioning, analyzed the various
   factors that affect the positioning accuracy using the carrier phase,
   and proposed the concept of using a frequency dilution of precision to
   describe the quantitative effect of different frequency combinations on
   the positioning precision. To this end, we computed and plotted the
   global spatial distribution map of the relative positioning dilution of
   precision for single-day solution, half-hour solution, and single-epoch
   solution of the global positioning system (GPS), regional Beidou
   navigation satellite system (BDS2), future global Beidou navigation
   satellite system (BDS3), and their fusion systems. Using processing
   software with autonomous intellectual property rights (GCN and
   VENUS/ARSNet), we solved the measurement data and examined the
   positioning precision of the single-day solution and single-epoch
   solution of GPS and BDS2. The analysis demonstrated that the B1/B2
   frequency positioning precision of BDS2 was better than that of L1/L2
   frequency positioning of GPS, but the positioning precision of the BDS2
   is worse than that of GPS over most of the service region of the BDS2.
   Further, the positioning precision of BDS3 is better than that of GPS in
   the Asia-Pacific region, while it is the opposite in other regions.
   Based on these conclusions, we put forth some optimization
   recommendations regarding the signal frequency of the navigation system
   and GPS measurement standards to serve as references for optimizing the
   system performance and formulating standards.

AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) models use semantic representations of visual
   classes to transfer the knowledge learned from a set of training classes
   to a set of unknown test classes. In the context of generic object
   recognition, previous research has mainly focused on developing custom
   architectures, loss functions, and regularization schemes for ZSL using
   word embeddings as semantic representation of visual classes. In this
   paper, we exclusively focus on the affect of different semantic
   representations on the accuracy of ZSL. We first conduct a large scale
   evaluation of semantic representations learned from either words, text
   documents, or knowledge graphs on the standard ImageNet ZSL benchmark.
   We show that, using appropriate semantic representations of visual
   classes, a basic linear regression model outperforms the vast majority
   of previously proposed approaches. We then analyze the classification
   errors of our model to provide insights into the relevance and
   limitations of the different semantic representations we investigate.
   Finally, our investigation helps us understand the reasons behind the
   success of recently proposed approaches based on graph convolution
   networks (GCN) which have shown dramatic improvements over previous
   state-of-the-art models.

AB Land type survey is an important task of land resources survey and the
   basis of scientific management of land resources. With the increasingly
   prominent problems of population, resources, and environment, there is
   an urgent need for a fast and accurate classification method of
   large-scale land use and land cover based on remote sensing data.
   Traditional machine learning classification methods based on pixel
   classification achieved sufficient results and are widely used, such as
   maximum likelihood classification and random forests method. However,
   with the development of the novel technology of deep learning, in
   practical application, for multi-classified land resources, how to use
   the fast and effective classification method of low and medium
   resolution RS images needs further research. This paper takes the land
   resource classification of the Tonghe medium resolution RS dataset of
   the third land survey in China as an example to screen and compare
   traditional machine learning classification methods and semantic
   segmentation models FC-DenseNet56, GCN, BiSeNet, U-Net, DeepLabV3,
   AdapNet, and PSPNet, which aim to select the optimal feature extraction
   model. The results show that the classification accuracy of the U-Net
   model can reach 93.62%, which is more accurate and effective than
   traditional machine learning methods and other semantic segmentation
   models. It is suitable for multi-classification tasks of land cover
   resources in low and medium resolution RS images and shows a superior
   effect in practical application. Besides, the conclusion of this study
   can provide a demonstration for large-scale land cover resources
   investigation using low and medium resolution RS images.

AB Current state-of-the-art sequence labeling models are typically based on
   sequential architecture such as Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM). However,
   the structure of processing a word at a time based on the sequential
   order restricts the full utilization of non-sequential features,
   including syntactic relationships, word co-occurrence relations, and
   document topics. They can be regarded as the corpus-level features and
   critical for sequence labeling. In this paper, we propose a Corpus-Aware
   Graph Aggregation Network. Specifically, we build three types of graphs,
   i.e., a word-topic graph, a word co-occurrence graph, and a word
   syntactic dependency graph, to express different kinds of corpus-level
   non-sequential features. After that, a graph convolutional network (GCN)
   is adapted to model the relations between words and non-sequential
   features. Finally, we employ a label-aware attention mechanism to
   aggregate corpus-aware non-sequential features and sequential ones for
   sequence labeling. The experimental results on four sequence labeling
   tasks (named entity recognition, chunking, multilingual sequence
   labeling, and target-based sentiment analysis) show that our model
   achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB Solving partial differential equations of complex physical systems is a
   computationally expensive task, especially in Computational Fluid
   Dynamics(CFD). This drives the application of deep learning methods in
   solving physical systems. There exist a few deep learning models that
   are very successful in predicting flow fields of complex physical
   models, yet most of these still exhibit large errors compared to
   simulation. Here we introduce AMGNET, a multi-scale graph neural network
   model based on Encoder-Process-Decoder structure for flow field
   prediction. Our model employs message passing of graph neural networks
   at different mesh graph scales. Our method has significantly lower
   prediction errors than the GCN baseline on several complex fluid
   prediction tasks, such as airfoil flow and cylinder flow. Our results
   show that multi-scale representation learning at the graph level is more
   effective in improving the prediction accuracy of flow field.

AB In this work, we propose a new patch-based framework called VPU for the
   video-based point cloud upsampling task by effectively exploiting
   temporal dependency among multiple consecutive point cloud frames, in
   which each frame consists of a set of unordered, sparse and irregular 3D
   points. Rather than adopting the sophisticated motion estimation
   strategy in video analysis, we propose a new spatio-temporal aggregation
   (STA) module to effectively extract, align and aggregate rich local
   geometric clues from consecutive frames at the feature level. By more
   reliably summarizing spatio-temporally consistent and complementary
   knowledge from multiple frames in the resultant local structural
   features, our method better infers the local geometry distributions at
   the current frame. In addition, our STA module can be readily
   incorporated with various existing single frame-based point upsampling
   methods (e.g., PU-Net, MPU, PU-GAN and PU-GCN). Comprehensive
   experiments on multiple point cloud sequence datasets demonstrate our
   video-based point cloud upsampling framework achieves substantial
   performance improvement over its single frame-based counterparts.

AB The catalytic conversion of biomass-derived chemicals to value added
   products is currently a topic of high importance, as it addresses the
   problems pertaining to both energy and the environment. In this regard,
   it is pertinent to design and develop catalysts using low cost and Earth
   abundant materials, which could perform these biomass conversion
   reactions in environment friendly green solvents. Keeping these aspects
   in mind, we have designed and developed a heterogeneous catalyst,
   sulfonated graphitic carbon nitride (S-GCN), which possesses amphoteric
   properties by having both Bronsted base and Bronsted acid sites.
   Subsequently, we have used this catalyst for the conversion of different
   biomass-derived saccharides (glucose, fructose, cellobiose, sucrose and
   starch) to a highly selective value added product,
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), which is a platform chemical for
   biodiesel and other fuels. All the reactions have been performed in
   green solvents, such as water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and dimethyl
   carbonate, and good yields have been obtained. The detailed optimization
   of the reaction conditions (temperature, time and catalyst amount) has
   also been performed, in addition to the calculation of green metric
   parameters. Furthermore, the synthesized 5-HMF can also be transformed
   to various other value added products, such as
   2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, 5-(chloromethyl)furfural and
   5-(bromomethyl)furfural. Moreover, the catalyst showed easy separation
   and good recyclability and also maintained structural integrity, which
   makes it a sustainable catalyst with high efficiency for the conversion
   of biomass-derived chemicals to value added products.

AB Identification of new drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important
   but a time-consuming and costly step in drug discovery. In recent years,
   to mitigate these drawbacks, researchers have sought to identify DTIs
   using computational approaches. However, most existing methods construct
   drug networks and target networks separately, and then predict novel
   DTIs based on known associations between the drugs and targets without
   accounting for associations between drug-protein pairs (DPPs). To
   incorporate the associations between DPPs into DTI modeling, we built a
   DPP network based on multiple drugs and proteins in which DPPs are the
   nodes and the associations between DPPs are the edges of the network. We
   then propose a novel learning-based framework, 'graph convolutional
   network (GCN)-DTI', for DTI identification. The model first uses a graph
   convolutional network to learn the features for each DPP. Second, using
   the feature representation as an input, it uses a deep neural network to
   predict the final label. The results of our analysis show that the
   proposed framework outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches by a
   large margin.

AB Scene graph generation (SGG) is built on top of detected objects to
   predict object pairwise visual relations for describing the image
   content abstraction. Existing works have revealed that if the links
   between objects are given as prior knowledge, the performance of SGG is
   significantly improved. Inspired by this observation, in this article,
   we propose a relation regularized network (R2-Net), which can predict
   whether there is a relationship between two objects and encode this
   relation into object feature refinement and better SGG. Specifically, we
   first construct an affinity matrix among detected objects to represent
   the probability of a relationship between two objects. Graph convolution
   networks (GCNs) over this relation affinity matrix are then used as
   object encoders, producing relation-regularized representations of
   objects. With these relation-regularized features, our R2-Net can
   effectively refine object labels and generate scene graphs. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on the visual genome dataset for three SGG
   tasks (i.e., predicate classification, scene graph classification, and
   scene graph detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed
   method. Ablation studies also verify the key roles of our proposed
   components in performance improvement.

AB Expressway section speed can visually reflect the section operation
   condition, and accurate short time section speed prediction has a wide
   range of applications in path planning and traffic guidance. However,
   existing expressway speed prediction data have defects, such as sparse
   density and incomplete object challenges. Thus, this paper proposes a
   framework for a combined expressway traffic speed prediction model based
   on wavelet transform and spatial-temporal graph convolutional network
   (WSTGCN) of the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) gantry transaction
   data. First, the framework pre-processes the ETC gantry transaction data
   to construct the section speeds. Then wavelet decomposition and
   single-branch reconstruction are performed on the section speed
   sequences, and the spatial features are captured by graph convolutional
   network (GCN) for each reconstructed single-branch sequence, and the
   temporal features are extracted by connecting the gated recurrent unit
   (GRU). The experiments use the ETC gantry transaction data of the
   expressway from Quanzhou to Xiamen. The results indicate that the WSTGCN
   model makes notable improvements compared to the model of the baseline
   for different prediction ranges.

   Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying HAT. The model first
   characterizes interactions among words, posts, dates, and users, and
   then derives a Time Gated Human Activity Graph Convolutional Network
   (TG-HAGCN) to predict the HATs of social media trajectory. To examine
   the proposed model performance, we built a new dataset including
   interactions between post content, post time, and users from the open
   Yelp dataset. Experimental results show that exploiting interactions
   hidden in social media to recognize HATs achieves state-of-the-art
   performance with high accuracy. The study indicates that interactions
   among social media promotes ability of machine learning on social media
   data mining and intelligent applications, and offers a reference
   solution for how to fuse multi-type heterogeneous data in social media.

AB Accurate subway passenger flow prediction is crucial to operation
   management and line scheduling. It can also promote the construction of
   intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Due to the complex spatial
   features and time-varying traffic patterns of subway networks, the
   prediction task is still challenging. Thus, a hybrid neural network
   model, GCTN (graph convolutional and comprehensive temporal neural
   network), is proposed. The model combines the Transformer network and
   long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the global and local
   temporal dependency. Besides, it uses a graph convolutional network
   (GCN) to capture the spatial features of the subway network. For the
   sake of the stability and accuracy for long-term passenger flow
   prediction, we enhance the influence of the station itself and the
   global station and combine the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
   Transformer. The model is verified by the passenger flow data of the
   Shanghai Subway. Compared with some typical data-driven methods, the
   results show that the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy in
   different time intervals and exhibits superiority in prediction
   stability and robustness. Besides, the model has a better performance in
   the peak value and the period when passenger flow changes quickly.

AB Motivated by potential financial gain, companies may hire fraudster
   groups to write fake reviews to either demote competitors or promote
   their own businesses. Such groups are considerably more successful in
   misleading customers, as people are more likely to be influenced by the
   opinion of a large group. To detect such groups, a common model is to
   represent fraudster groups' static networks, consequently overlooking
   the longitudinal behavior of a reviewer, thus, the dynamics of coreview
   relations among reviewers in a group. Hence, these approaches are
   incapable of excluding outlier reviewers, which are fraudsters
   intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine reviewers
   happen to coreview in fraudster groups. To address this issue, we
   propose "FGDT", a framework for "fraudster group detection through
   temporal relations." FGDT first capitalizes on the effectiveness of the
   HIN-recurrent neural network (RNN) in both reviewers' representation
   learning while capturing the collaboration between reviewers. The
   HIN-RNN models the coreview relations of reviewers in a group in a fixed
   time window of 28 days. We refer to this as spatial relation learning
   representation to signify the generalizability of this work to other
   networked scenarios. Then, we use an RNN on the spatial relations to
   predict the spatio-temporal relations of reviewers in the group. In the
   third step, a graph convolution network (GCN) refines the reviewers'
   vector representations using these predicted relations. These refined
   representations are then used to remove outlier reviewers. The average
   of the remaining reviewers' representation is then fed to a simple fully
   connected layer to predict if the group is a fraudster group or not.
   Exhaustive experiments of FGDT showed a 5% (4%), 12% (5%), and 12% (5%)
   improvement over three of the most recent approaches on precision,
   recall, and F1-value over the Yelp (Amazon) dataset, respectively.

AB WRKY transcription factor (TF) is plant specific genes and play
   essential roles involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Gene
   co-expression network (GCN) analysis is effective tool for the
   interpretation of transcriptomic data. In this study, a co-expression
   network of 152 WRKY genes using publicly available microarray data
   (GSE78242) was constructed under low phosphate (Pi) treatment in soybean
   (Glycine max). A total of 149 nodes and 641 edges were obtained from CGN
   and seven seed genes were identified. Particularly, Glyma.19G094100 and
   Glyma.16G054400 seed genes (orthologue to Arabidopsis WRKY75) were found
   to have a direct connection to P deficiency. Promotor analyses of seed
   genes revealed the variations in the number of cis-regulatory elements
   (CREs) ranging from 80 to 137 with a total of 835 CREs. The methylation
   profile of Glyma.04G218700 (orthologue to Arabidopsis WRKY51) was found
   higher than other seed genes. As a result, our findings can be used as a
   scientific basis to cope with P deficiency in soybean as well as abiotic
   stress tolerance. In addition, these findings of this study may prove
   the crop improvement studies in future, especially genetically
   engineered soybean plants.

AB Ovarian cancer is one of the three most malignant tumors of the female
   reproductive system. At present, researchers do not know its
   pathogenesis, which makes the treatment effect unsatisfactory.
   Metabolomics is closely related to drug efficacy, safety evaluation,
   mechanism of action, and rational drug use. Therefore, identifying
   ovarian cancer-related metabolites could greatly help researchers
   understand the pathogenesis and develop treatment plans. However, the
   measurement of metabolites is inaccurate and greatly affects the
   environment, and biological experiment is time-consuming and costly.
   Therefore, researchers tend to use computational methods to identify
   disease-related metabolites in large scale. Since the hypothesis that
   similar diseases are related to similar metabolites is widely accepted,
   in this paper, we built both disease similarity network and metabolite
   similarity network and used graph convolutional network (GCN) to encode
   these networks. Then, support vector machine (SVM) was used to identify
   whether a metabolite is related to ovarian cancer. The experiment
   results show that the AUC and AUPR of our method are 0.92 and 0.81,
   respectively. Finally, we proposed an effective method to prioritize
   ovarian cancer-related metabolites in large scale.

AB In this study, the diatomite (DE) was firstly dispersed by the electron
   beam bombardment (EB) to form the modified diatomite (MDE), using as the
   carrier of the Fe doped carbon nitride (FGCN). The MDE/FGCN demonstrates
   broader light adsorption in the visible region and low recombination of
   photogenerated electron-hole, according to the results of spectroscopy
   techniques. Reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in the aqueous
   solution was used to illustrate the photocatalytic ability of MDE/FGCN.
   Results showed that the MDE/FGCN-1:3 (Fe, 10%) composites with EB dose
   of 30 kGy exhibited stronger reduction efficiency with 98.3% of Cr(VI)
   in 100 min, which was almost 16.92 times higher than that of pure GCN
   for the reaction rate. Additionally, lower pH values could promote the
   Cr(VI) reduction, and the MDE/FGCN displayed great stability after four
   runs. Lastly, the electron and heat effects of EB were creatively used
   to analyze the dispersion mechanism of MDE. The higher photocatalytic
   ability of MDE/FGCN could be attributed not only the dispersion of MDE
   but also the charge trapping by Fe. This study will broaden the
   application of physical irradiation in the modification of carriers for
   the photocatalyst, which can be applied in the treatment of
   environmental pollutants.

AB Exploiting deep learning techniques for traffic flow prediction has
   become increasingly widespread. Most existing studies combine CNN or GCN
   with recurrent neural network to extract the spatio-temporal features in
   traffic networks. The traffic networks can be naturally modeled as
   graphs which are effective to capture the topology and spatial
   correlations among road links. The issue is that the traffic network is
   dynamic due to the continuous changing of the traffic environment.
   Compared with the static graph, the dynamic graph can better reflect the
   spatio-temporal features of the traffic network. However, in practical
   applications, due to the limited accuracy and timeliness of data, it is
   hard to generate graph structures through frequent statistical data.
   Therefore, it is necessary to design a method to overcome data defects
   in traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a long-term
   traffic flow prediction method based on dynamic graphs. The traffic
   network is modeled by dynamic traffic flow probability graphs, and graph
   convolution is performed on the dynamic graphs to learn spatial
   features, which are then combined with LSTM units to learn temporal
   features. In particular, we further propose to use graph convolutional
   policy network based on reinforcement learning to generate dynamic
   graphs when the dynamic graphs are incomplete due to the data sparsity i
   sue. By testing our method on city-bike data in New York City, it
   demonstrates that our model can achieve stable and effective long-term
   predictions of traffic flow, and can reduce the impact of data defects
   on prediction results. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   uses Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn its feature and performs

AB Fluoroquinolone antibiotics attract increasing attention in the water
   treatment field because of the potential adverse effects on aquatic
   ecosystems and human health. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based
   photocatalysis has been demonstrated as an economically feasible and
   environmentally benign process to control these persistent contaminants.
   In this study, a new visible-light-driven of reduced graphene oxide
   (rGO) and nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) co-modified g-C3N4-based
   photocatalyst was synthesized via ultrasonication-assisted chemisorption
   method. The optimized nZVI-loaded rGO/g-C3N4 (10% IGCN) showed a
   reaction rate enhancement of 2.12 similar to 3.69-fold and 1.20 similar
   to 1.68-fold for the degradation of ofloxacin (OFL), norfloxacin (NOR),
   and ciprofloxacin (CIP) compared to that of carbon-doped g-C3N4
   (MCB0.07) and rGO-supported g-C3N4 (7.5% GCN) under the irradiation of
   simulated visible light, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic
   activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of nZVI and rGO to
   improve the separation of charge carriers and boost the harvest of
   visible light. The degradation mechanisms were explored by scavenger
   tests and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), indicating that holes
   (h(+)) played a dominant role in the decomposition of OFL, NOR, and CIP.
   The piperazine ring and C-N between the piperazine ring and benzene were
   the primary attack sites of h(+). In addition, the ring-opening
   oxidation of benzene (C=C bond) connected by the C-F bond may also be an
   essential step. This study shed light on the degradation mechanism of
   OFL, NOR, and CIP under visible light irradiation of the 10% IGCN and
   provided theoretical support for the practical application of
   photocatalysis in treating antibiotics-containing water.

AB Motivation: The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common
   to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.
   However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of
   adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge
   because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may
   change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The
   knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex
   relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small
   clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an
   important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality
   and morbidity.
   Results: Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy
   side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of
   protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions and the
   polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug
   interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type.
   Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with
   a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph
   convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in
   multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple
   drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect,
   if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically.
   Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming
   baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns
   representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of
   polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well
   polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on
   predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance
   because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types.
   Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient
   population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for
   follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.

AB Complex networks contain numerous unlabeled data. Extracting the
   information in these data and obtaining appropriate node representation
   poses a significant challenge. Recently, contrastive learning has gained
   wide acceptance as one of the most important methods in self -supervised
   learning. It has shown exceptional ability in capturing both the
   attribute and structural information in network, that provides a new way
   for network representation. In this paper, we propose the enhanced
   contrastive representation in network (ECRN). First, we recognize the
   issue that contrastive learning ignores the network structure in
   calculating the similarity of the joint distribution. To address the
   problem, ECRN proposes a feature combination method with additional
   structure information. Second, we retain the connection relationship of
   nodes in the low-dimensional embedding by constraining each layer of
   neural network. Third, we propose a new graph neural network framework,
   which independently compares each layer, and realizes hierarchical
   contrastive learning. ECRN obtains information-rich node representations
   by accumulating representations in each layer, enhancing the performance
   of downstream tasks. We tested the ECRN model on real datasets and
   compared its performance with well-known algorithms. Experiments show
   that the ECRN outperforms state-of-art methods in link prediction,
   clustering, and node classification tasks.

AB Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of items for a user to
   consume as a whole. Related work can be divided into two categories: 1)
   to recommend the platform's prebuilt bundles to users; 2) generate
   personalized bundles for users. In this work, we propose two graph
   neural network models, a BGCN model (short for Bundle Graph
   Convolutional Network) for prebuilt bundle recommendation, and a BGGN
   model (short for Bundle Graph Generation Network) for personalized
   bundle generation. First, BGCN unifies the user-item interaction, the
   user-bundle interaction and the bundle-item affiliation into a
   heterogeneous graph. With item nodes as the bridge, graph convolutional
   propagation between user and bundle nodes makes the learned
   representations capture the item-level semantics. Second, BGGN
   re-constructs bundles into graphs based on the item co-occurrence
   pattern and the user's supervision signal. The complex and high-order
   item-item relationships in the bundle graph are explicitly modeled
   through graph generation. Empirical results demonstrate the substantial
   performance gains of BGCN and BGGN, which outperforms the
   state-of-the-art baselines by 10.77% to 23.18% and 20.90% to 64.52%,
   respectively. We have released the datasets and codes at this link:

AB Vertex classification is an important graph mining technique and has
   important applications in fields such as social recommendation and
   e-Commerce recommendation. Existing classification methods fail to make
   full use of the graph topology to improve the classification
   performance. To alleviate it, we propose a Dual Graph Wavelet neural
   Network composed of two identical graph wavelet neural networks sharing
   network parameters. These two networks are integrated with a
   semisupervised loss function and carry out supervised learning and
   unsupervised learning on two matrixes representing the graph topology
   extracted from the same graph dataset, respectively. One matrix embeds
   the local consistency information and the other the global consistency
   information. To reduce the computational complexity of the convolution
   operation of the graph wavelet neural network, we design an approximate
   scheme based on the first type Chebyshev polynomial. Experimental
   results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches for vertex classification on all three
   benchmark datasets and the proposed approximation scheme is validated
   for datasets with low vertex average degree when the approximation order
   is small.

AB The mainstream object detectors usually treat each region separately,
   which overlooks the important global context information and the
   associations between object categories. Existing methods model global
   context via attention mechanism, which requires ad hoc design and prior
   knowledge. Some works combine CNN features with label dependencies
   learned from a pre-defined graph and word embeddings, which ignore the
   gap between visual features and textual corpus and are usually
   task-specific (depend on RoIPool/RoIAlign). In order to get rid of the
   previous specific settings, and enable different types of detectors to
   refine detection results with the help of prior knowledge, in this
   paper, we propose KROD (Knowledge-guided Reasonable Object Detection),
   which consists of the GKM (Global Category Knowledge Mining) module and
   CRM (Category Relationship Knowledge Mining) module, to improve
   detection performance by mimicking the processes of human reasoning. For
   a given image, GKM introduces global category knowledge into the
   detector by simply attaching a multi-label image classification branch
   to the backbone. Meanwhile, CRM input the raw detection outputs to the
   object category co-occurrence based knowledge graph to further refine
   the original results, with the help of GCN (Graph Convolutional
   Network). We also propose a novel loss-aware module to distinctively
   correct the classification probability of different detected boxes.
   Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments show that the proposed
   KROD can improve different baseline models (both anchor-based and
   anchor-free) by a large margin (1.2% similar to 1.8% higher AP) with
   marginal loss of efficiency on MS COCO.

AB Dynamic link prediction is a critical task in network research that
   seeks to predict future network links based on the relative behavior of
   prior network changes. However, most existing methods overlook mutual
   interactions between neighbors and long-distance interactions and lack
   the interpretability of the model's predictions. To tackle the above
   issues, in this paper, we propose a temporal group-aware graph diffusion
   network(TGGDN). First, we construct a group affinity matrix to describe
   mutual interactions between neighbors, i.e., group interactions. Then,
   we merge the group affinity matrix into the graph diffusion to form a
   group-aware graph diffusion, which simultaneously captures group
   interactions and long-distance interactions in dynamic networks.
   Additionally, we present a transformer block that models the temporal
   information of dynamic networks using self-attention, allowing the TGGDN
   to pay greater attention to task-related snapshots while also providing
   interpretability to better understand the network evolutionary patterns.
   We compare the proposed TGGDN with state-of-the-art methods on five
   different sizes of real-world datasets ranging from 1k to 20k nodes.
   Experimental results show that TGGDN achieves an average improvement of
   8.3% and 3.8% in terms of ACC and AUC on all datasets, respectively,
   demonstrating the superiority of TGGDN in the dynamic link prediction
   task.

AB Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has recently emerged as an
   effective treatment for patients with severe symptomatic aortic
   stenosis. Accurate prediction of postoperative conduction disturbance
   after TAVR is crucial for successful surgery planning. Most current risk
   prediction models for conduction disturbance rely on monomodal data
   methods, such as images. However, predicting conduction disturbance
   based on multimodal features becomes a challenge. We propose a new
   memory-augmented graph neural network (MemGCN) to deal with this
   challenge. The GCN in the proposed network is constructed by taking the
   patient's image features as nodes' features and creating the edges based
   on the patient's clinical features, thus effectively fusing the
   patients' images and clinical feature information. Moreover, the
   traditional GCN model trains feature extractors and GCNs independently
   due to limited computing resources, which can negatively impact the
   feature learning process. We introduce the memory bank and propose a
   local update learning algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the
   proposed method connects the feature extractors and GCN through a memory
   bank. The CNN module extracts patients' features from their ECG images
   and updates the memory bank. The GCN constructs the graph using the
   patients' characteristics in the memory bank as node features. In this
   way, the node features are cached in the memory bank and gradually
   updated at each optimization iteration so that the feature extractors
   and GCN are optimized jointly. The experiments on a real-world TAVR
   dataset show the proposed method's superior performance. It improves the
   prediction accuracy by over 4% compared to the traditional GCN model.
   Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method to
   other multimodal data analysis tasks, we evaluate the performance of the
   proposed method on an ocular disease intelligent recognition benchmark.
   The proposed method achieves competitive prediction performance.

AB Graph attention network (GAT) is a promising framework for message
   passing on graphs, but how to exploit rich, high-order structural
   information in the attention mechanism is still an open challenge.
   Furthermore, increasing the attention range to more than one-hop
   neighbors can negatively affect the performance of GAT, reflecting the
   over-smoothing risk of graph neural networks in general. In this paper,
   we propose an "adaptive structural fingerprint" model to fully exploit
   complex graph topology in graph attention networks. The key idea is to
   contextualize each node with its "structural fingerprint" that can
   automatically adjust to the local graph topology and edge connections in
   the neighborhood of the node. By doing this, structural interactions
   between the nodes can be evaluated more accurately and better confined
   to relevant neighbors, thus contributing to an improved attention
   mechanism and clearer cluster boundary. Furthermore, our approach
   provides a useful platform for different subspace of node features and
   various spatial scale of graph structures to "cross-talk" with each
   other through multi-head attention, which is more flexible than existing
   attention mechanism using a fixed, minimal spatial attention scale.
   Encouraging results are observed on a number of benchmark data sets
   including citation and social networks. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier

AB Most of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models are designed for static
   KGs where entity and relation sets are fixed. These approaches are
   inherently transductive because they simply predict the plausibility of
   facts whose entities and relations had to previously appear in the
   training phase. However, since entities and relations are constantly
   added, removed, or changed over time, KGC models should be able to
   generalize to out-of-KG entities and relations in evolving KGs, which
   are more suited to real-world scenarios. Moreover, incorporating global
   graph-structured information into KGC models is another challenging
   issue. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel Inductive
   KG Embedding (IKGE) model for open-world KGC, which accommodates
   out-of-KG entities and relations. Unlike training individual unique
   embeddings, the proposed model fundamentally learns an embedding
   generator function to elaborately generate fact embeddings in an
   inductive manner. Specifically, the feature information of each fact is
   extracted as a vector from its entity-related and relation-related side
   information via an attention mechanism. Then, to score a given fact, our
   neighborhood feature aggregator hierarchically accumulates the feature
   information of multi-hop neighbors. Experimental results show that IKGE
   outperforms existing approaches in both transductive and inductive
   setups by successfully aggregating neighborhood features.(c) 2021

AB Accurate forecasting of traffic flows remains a significant challenge
   owing to its complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Although existing
   methods capture some spatiotemporal dependencies and stack them in a
   channel dimension, long-range sequences, implicit patterns, hidden
   fine-grained features and multi-scaled spatiotemporal dependencies are
   often ignored, which makes it difficult to represent the spatiotemporal
   dependencies comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, a novel
   deep learning model named Graph Spatiotemporal Channel Unet (U-shaped
   network) is proposed to achieve accurate and reliable traffic flow
   forecasting. First, a new temporal encoder-decoder module with causal
   convolution and transposed convolution is proposed, which can
   efficiently alleviate the gradient explosion/vanishing in capturing
   long-range sequences during encoding and decoding. Secondly, a new
   channel self-attention mechanism is proposed, which can efficiently
   capture the implicit patterns and hidden fine-grained features between
   channels and enhance the representation ability of the spatiotemporal
   dependencies. Thirdly, a new U-shaped multi-scaled spatiotemporal graph
   convolutional network is proposed to effectively capture the
   multi-scaled spatiotemporal dependencies. Experiments on two real-world
   datasets show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models and
   achieves accurate traffic flow forecasting.

AB Graph neural networks have revealed powerful potential in ranking
   recommendation. Existing methods based on bipartite graphs for ranking
   recommendation mainly focus on homogeneous graphs and usually treat user
   and item nodes as the same kind of nodes, however, the user-item
   bipartite graph is always heterogeneous. Additionally, various types of
   nodes have varying effects on recommendations, and a good node
   representation can be learned by successfully differentiating the same
   type of nodes. In this paper, we develop a nodepersonalized multi -graph
   convolutional network (NP-MGCN) for ranking recommendation. It consists
   of a node importance awareness block, a graph construction module, and a
   node information propagation and aggregation framework. Specifically, a
   node importance awareness block is proposed to encode nodes using node
   degree information to highlight the differences between nodes.
   Subsequently, the Jaccard similarity and co -occurrence matrix fusion
   graph construction module is devised to acquire user-user and item-item
   graphs, enriching correlation information between users and between
   items. Finally, a composite hop node information propagation and
   aggregation framework, including single -hop and double -hop branches,
   is designed. The high -order connectivity is used to aggregate
   heterogeneous information for the single -hop branch, while the multi
   -hop dependency is utilized to aggregate homogeneous information for the
   double -hop branch. It makes user and item node embedding more
   discriminative and integrates the different nodes' heterogeneity into
   the model. Experiments on several datasets manifest that NP-MGCN
   achieves outstanding recommendation performance than existing methods.

AB Worldwide manufacturing industries are significantly affected by
   COVID-19 pandemic because of their production characteristics with
   low-cost country sourcing, globalization, and inventory level. To
   analyze the correlated time series, spatial-temporal model becomes more
   attractive, and the graph convolution network (GCN) is also commonly
   used to provide more information to the nodes and its neighbors in the
   graph. Recently, attention-adjusted graph spatio-temporal network
   (AGSTN) was proposed to address the problem of pre-defined graph in GCN
   by combining multi-graph convolution and attention adjustment to learn
   spatial and temporal correlations over time. However, AGSTN may show
   potential problem with limited small non-sensor data; particularly,
   convergence issue. This study proposes several variants of AGSTN and
   applies them to non-sensor data. We suggest data augmentation and
   regularization techniques such as edge selection, time series
   decomposition, prevention policies to improve AGSTN. An empirical study
   of worldwide manufacturing industries in pandemic era was conducted to
   validate the proposed variants. The results show that the proposed
   variants significantly improve the prediction performance at least

AB Previous studies have shown that incorporating sentiment knowledge
   (e.g., sentiment scores) is effective for aspect-based sentiment
   analysis (ABSA). However, sentiment knowledge is used to create static
   features, which cannot be propagated over an entire corpus. Unlike
   previous researchers, we designed a corpus-level sentiment knowledge
   fusion mechanism with storage, update, and sharing functions, which can
   help the model to better understand the sentiment information of various
   opinion words in the dataset. Specifically, we first constructed a
   dependency graph for each sentence and refined the weights of the edges
   by the relative distance between the aspect terms and context words. We
   then introduced two special sentiment knowledge nodes in the graph to
   establish connections with opinion words by leveraging external
   sentiment lexicons. We set these two nodes to be globally shared and
   updatable, which allowed the model to learn corpus-level and
   domain-specific sentiment knowledge. This knowledge can help the model
   to generate a better aspect representation that contains rich contextual
   information and sentiment knowledge. Extensive experiments were
   conducted on several public datasets, and the experimental results
   demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. We also analyzed the
   performance gains from using learned corpus-level sentiment knowledge to
   transfer across different datasets.

AB Predicting information diffusion helps grasp the overall preference of
   user interactions, facilitating applications such as public opinion
   analysis and online marketing. Existing approaches sample the
   information cascade network into several independent paths or subgraphs
   to learn cascade representations, resulting in information loss
   regarding the social influence of nodes and dynamics between cascades
   across different temporal stages. To address such problems, we design a
   deep learning-based model (named I3T) using Inter-and Intra-Path of
   Influence Transitivity to predict the incremental popularity of
   information diffusion in information networks. First, we leverage a
   graph neural network (GNN) to aggregate the node information of the
   local neighbors. Then, we sample the information cascade into a group of
   sequences using DeepWalk and update the node embedding with GNN and
   DeepWalk simultaneously, which embodies both the inter-path and
   intra-path of influence transitivity. Next, we exploit bi-directional
   long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract structural features and
   apply gated recurrent unit (GRU) to extract temporal features. Finally,
   we learn the structural factor weight under the temporal guidance of the
   attention mechanism. The results of comprehensive experiments conducted
   on two representative datasets demonstrate the preeminence of I3T over
   existing state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Visual relational reasoning is a central component in recent cross-modal
   analysis tasks, which aims at reasoning about the visual relationships
   between objects and their properties. These relationships provide rich
   semantics and help to enhance the visual representation for improving
   cross-modal learning. Previous works have succeeded in modeling latent
   visual relationships or rigid-categorized visual relationships. However,
   these kinds of methods leave out the problem of ambiguity inherent in
   the visual relationships because of the diverse relational semantics of
   different visual appearances. In this work, we explore to model the
   visual relationships by context-aware representations based on human
   prior knowledge. Based on such representations, we novelly propose a
   plug-and-play visual relational reasoning module to enhance image
   encoding. Specifically, we design an Anisotropic Graph Convolution to
   utilize the information of relation embeddings and relation
   directionality between objects for generating relation-aware image
   representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the relational
   reasoning module by applying it to both Visual Question Answering (VQA)
   and Cross-Modal Information Retrieval (CMIR) tasks. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on VQA 2.0 and CMPlaces datasets and superior
   performance is reported when comparing with state-of-the-art works. (C)

AB The problem of detecting key nodes in a network (i.e. nodes with the
   greatest ability to spread an infection) has been studied extensively in
   the past. Some approaches to key node detection compute node centrality,
   but there is no formal proof that central nodes also have the greatest
   spreading capacity. Other methods use epidemiological models (e.g., the
   SIR model) to describe the spread of an infection and rely on numerical
   simulations to find out key nodes; these methods are highly accurate but
   computationally expensive. To efficiently but accurately detect key
   nodes, we propose a novel deep learning method called Rank by Graph
   Convolutional Network, RGCN. Our method constructs a subnetwork around
   each node to estimate its spreading power; then RGCN applies a graph
   convolutional network to each subnetwork and the adjacency matrix of the
   network to learn node embeddings. Finally, a neural network is applied
   to the node embeddings to detect key nodes. Our RGCN method outperforms
   state-of-the-art approaches such as RCNN and MRCNN by 11.84% and 13.99%,
   respectively, when we compare the Kendall's s coefficient between the
   node ranking produced by each method with the true ranking obtained by
   SIR simulations.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on

   means for virtual reality of industrial manufacturing process. An

   the process of marginal layer plays an essential role to enhance the
   safety of industrial equipment. In this study, a manufacturing life
   cycle is described and characterized as operation and remote controlling
   of industrial machineries. The edge servers are first employed to track
   physical devices. Then a novel unified adaptive deep classification
   framework for SA with semi-supervised classification method is developed
   to find unknown patterns in a huge amount of industrial data.
   Furthermore, a robust model based on the selection of adaptive local
   neighbor is proposed to find out an optimal weight and high similarity
   of neighbors. The combination of the proposed framework and model can
   realize real-time SA of modern manufacturing the execution system.
   Plentiful experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the high

AB Motor disorder is a typical symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Neurologists assess the severity of PD motor symptoms using the clinical
   rating scale, i.e., MDS-UPDRS. However, this assessment method is
   time-consuming and easily affected by the perception difference of
   assessors. In the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019,
   telemedicine for PD has become extremely urgent for clinical practice.
   To solve these problems, we developed an automated and objective
   assessment method of the leg agility task in the MDS-UPDRS using videos
   and a graph neural network. In this study, a sparse adaptive graph
   convolutional network (SA-GCN) was proposed to achieve fine-grained
   quantitative assessment of skeleton sequences extracted from videos.
   Specifically, the sparse adaptive graph convolutional unit with a prior
   knowledge constraint was proposed to perform adaptive spatial modeling
   of physical and logical dependency for skeleton sequences, thus
   achieving the sparse modeling of the discriminative spatial
   relationships. Subsequently, a temporal context module was introduced to
   construct the remote context dependency in the temporal dimension, hence
   determining the global changes of the task. A multi-domain attention
   learning module was also developed to integrate the static spatial
   features and dynamic temporal features, and then to emphasize the
   salient feature selection in the channel domain, thereby capturing the
   multi-domain fine-grained information. Finally, the evaluation results
   using a dataset with 148 patients and 870 samples confirmed the
   effectiveness and reliability of our scheme, and the method outperformed
   other related state-of-the-art methods. Our contactless method provides
   a new potential tool for automated PD assessment and telemedicine.

AB Identifying protein complexes is an important issue in computational
   biology, as it benefits the understanding of cellular functions and the
   design of drugs. In the past decades, many computational methods have
   been proposed by mining dense subgraphs in Protein-Protein Interaction
   Networks (PINs). However, the high rate of false positive/negative
   interactions in PINs prevents accurately detecting complexes directly
   from the raw PINs. In this paper, we propose a denoising approach for
   protein complex detection by using variational graph auto-encoder.
   First, we embed a PIN to vector space by a stacked graph convolutional
   network (GCN), then decide which interactions in the PIN are credible.
   If the probability of an interaction being credible is less than a
   threshold, we delete the interaction. In such a way, we reconstruct a
   reliable PIN. Following that, we detect protein complexes in the
   reconstructed PIN by using several typical detection methods, including
   CPM, Coach, DPClus, GraphEntropy, IPCA and MCODE, and compare the
   results with those obtained directly from the original PIN. We conduct
   the empirical evaluation on four yeast PPI datasets (Gavin, Krogan, DIP
   and Wiphi) and two human PPI datasets (Reactome and Reactomekb), against
   two yeast complex benchmarks (CYC2008 and MIPS) and three human complex
   benchmarks (REACT, REACT uniprotkb and CORE COMPLEX human),
   respectively. Experimental results show that with the reconstructed PINs
   obtained by our denoising approach, complex detection performance can
   get obviously boosted, in most cases by over 5%, sometimes even by 200%.
   Furthermore, we compare our approach with two existing denoising methods
   (RWS and RedNemo) while varying different matching rates on separate
   complex distributions. Our results show that in most cases (over 2/3),
   the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.

AB Graphs and networks are very common data structure for modelling complex
   systems that are composed of a number of nodes and topologies, such as
   social networks, citation networks, biological protein-protein
   interactions networks, etc. In recent years, machine learning has become
   an efficient technique to obtain representation of graph for downstream
   graph analysis tasks, including node classification, link prediction,
   and community detection. Different with traditional graph analytical
   models, the representation learning on graph tries to learn low
   dimensional embeddings by means of machine learning models that could be
   trained in supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised manners. Compared
   with traditional approaches that directly use input node attributes,
   these embeddings are much more informative and helpful for graph
   analysis. There are a number of developed models in this respect, that
   are different in the ways of measuring similarity of vertexes in both
   original space and feature space. In order to learn more efficient node
   representation with better generalization property, we propose a
   task-independent graph representation model, called as graph
   deconvolutional network (GDN), and corresponding unsupervised learning
   algorithm in this paper. Different with graph convolution network (GCN)
   from the scratch, which produces embeddings by convolving input
   attribute vectors with learned filters, the embeddings of the proposed
   GDN model are desired to be convolved with filters so that reconstruct
   the input node attribute vectors as far as possible. The embeddings and
   filters are alternatively optimized in the learning procedure. The
   correctness of the proposed GDN model is verified by multiple tasks over
   several datasets. The experimental results show that the GDN model
   outperforms existing alternatives with a big margin. (C) 2020 Elsevier

AB Photocatalytic activity of low band gap semiconductor largely restrained
   by high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. To enhance
   the catalytic performance numerous protocols were adopted amongst which
   designing of novel hybrid via coupling of semiconductors are very
   intriguing from modest application point of view. Here, we report facile
   realization of type II heterojunctions embracing polymeric graphitic
   carbon nitride (g-C3N4/GCN) and all-inorganic cesium lead halide
   perovskite (CsPbBrCl2) for degradation complex organic effluents under
   visible-light illumination. Synthesized hybrid presented much improved
   performance in toxic cationic and anionic dyes degradation as compared
   to individual building units. Signature of favorable staggered gap
   junction's formation at interface was confirmed via Mott-Schottky
   analysis. Such kind of junctions delay the recombination of
   photogenerated electron holes and facilitates active radical generation
   at catalyst surface thereby ensures improved photocatalytic performance.
   Charge transfer process in heterojunction further illustrated via
   Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Several scavenger
   tests have been performed to examine the impact of different active
   radicals in the photocatalysis which suggests manifold performance
   improvement in the presence of very small concentrations of EDTA. A
   plausible photocatalytic mechanism in accordance with the type II
   junction has been proposed.

AB Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion computing has become one of
   the research hotspots of human-computer interaction (HCI). However, it
   is difficult to effectively learn the interactions between brain regions
   in emotional states by using traditional convolutional neural networks
   because there is information transmission between neurons, which
   constitutes the brain network structure. In this paper, we proposed a
   novel model combining graph convolutional network and convolutional
   neural network, namely MDGCN-SRCNN, aiming to fully extract features of
   channel connectivity in different receptive fields and deep layer
   abstract features to distinguish different emotions. Particularly, we
   add style-based recalibration module to CNN to extract deep layer
   features, which can better select features that are highly related to
   emotion. We conducted two individual experiments on SEED data set and
   SEED-IV data set, respectively, and the experiments proved the
   effectiveness of MDGCN-SRCNN model. The recognition accuracy on SEED and
   SEED-IV is 95.08 and 85.52%, respectively. Our model has better
   performance than other state-of-art methods. In addition, by visualizing
   the distribution of different layers features, we prove that the
   combination of shallow layer and deep layer features can effectively
   improve the recognition performance. Finally, we verified the important
   brain regions and the connection relationships between channels for
   emotion generation by analyzing the connection weights between channels
   after model learning.

AB Introduction The clinical syndrome of neonatal sepsis, comprising signs
   of infection, septic shock and organ dysfunction in infants <= 4weeks of
   age, is a frequent sequel to bloodstream infection and mandates urgent
   antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial characterisation and antimicrobial
   susceptibility testing is vital for ensuring appropriate therapy, as
   high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially in low-income
   and middle income countries, may adversely affect outcome. Ho Chi Minh
   City (HCMC) in Vietnam is a rapidly expanding city in Southeast Asia
   with a current population of almost 8 million. There are limited
   contemporary data on the causes of neonatal sepsis in Vietnam, and we
   hypothesise that the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria is an
   increasing problem for the appropriate management of sepsis cases. In
   this study, we aim to investigate the major causes of neonatal sepsis
   and assess disease outcomes by clinical features, antimicrobial
   susceptibility profiles and genome composition.
   Method and analysis We will conduct a prospective observational study to
   characterise the clinical and microbiological features of neonatal
   sepsis in a major children's hospital in HCMC. All bacteria isolated
   from blood subjected to whole genome sequencing. We will compare
   clinical variables and outcomes between different bacterial species,
   genome Gomposition and AMR gene content. AMR gene content will be
   assessed and stratified by species, years and contributing hospital
   departments. Genome sequences will be analysed to investigate
   phylogenetic relationships.
   Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted in accordance with
   the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International
   Council on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. EthiGs
   approval has been provided by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics
   Committee 35-16 and Vietnam Children's Hospital 1 Ethics Committee
   73/GCN/BVND1. The findings will be disseminated at international
   conferences and peer reviewed journals.

AB Cancer has become one of the critical diseases threatening human life
   and health. The sensitivity difference of cancer drugs has always been a
   critical cause of the treatment come to nothing. Once drug resistance
   occurs, it will make the anticancer treatment or even various drugs
   ineffective. With the deepening of cancer research, a growing number of
   evidence shows that microRNA has a particular regulatory effect on the
   sensitivity of cancer drugs, which provides new research ideas. However,
   using traditional biological experiments to verify and discover the
   relations of microRNA-drug sensitivity is cumbersome and time-consuming,
   significantly slowing down cancer drug sensitivity's research progress.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a computational method (PDSM-LGCN) that
   spreads information through the high-order connection between cancer
   drug sensitivity and microRNA. At the same time, the model constructs an
   optimized-GCN as an embedding propagation layer to obtain the practical
   embeddings of microRNA and medicines. Finally, based on a collaborative
   filtering algorithm, the model brings the prediction score between
   microRNA and drug sensitivity. The results of fivefold cross-validation
   show that the AUC of PDSM-LGCN is 0.8872, and the AUPR is as high as
   0.9026. At the same time, we also reproduced the five latest models of
   similar problems and compared the results. Our model has the best
   comprehensive effect among them. In addition, the reliability of
   PDSM-LGCN was further confirmed through the case study of Cisplatin and
   Doxorubicin, which can be used as a powerful tool for clinical and
   biological research.

AB Recently, many pre-trained text embedding models have been applied to
   effectively extract latent features from texts and achieve remarkable
   performance in various downstream tasks of sentiment analysis domain.
   However, these pre-trained text embedding models also encounter
   limitations related to the capability preserving the syntactical
   structure as well as the global long-range dependent relationships of
   words. Thus, they might fail to recognize the relevant syntactical
   features of words as valuable evidences for analyzing sentiment aspects.
   To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel deep semantic
   contextual embedding technique for sentiment analysis, called as: SE4SA.
   Our proposed SE4SA is a multi-level text embedding model which enables
   to jointly exploit the long-range syntactical and sequential
   representations of texts. Then, these achieved rich semantic textual
   representations can support to have a better understanding on the
   sentiment aspects of the given text corpus, thereby resulting the better
   performance on sentiment analysis task. Extensive experiments in several
   benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness or our proposed SE4SA
   model in comparing with recent state-of-the-art model.

AB Emerging graph neural networks (GNNs) have extended the successes of
   deep learning techniques against datasets like images and texts to more
   complex graph-structured data. By leveraging GPU accelerators, existing
   frameworks combine mini-batch and sampling for effective and efficient
   model training on large graphs. However, this setup faces a scalability
   issue since loading rich vertex features from CPU to GPU through a
   limited bandwidth link usually dominates the training cycle. In this
   article, we propose PaGraph, a novel, efficient data loader that
   supports general and efficient sampling-based GNN training on
   single-server with multi-GPU. PaGraph significantly reduces the data
   loading time by exploiting available GPU resources to keep
   frequently-accessed graph data with a cache. It also embodies a
   lightweight yet effective caching policy that takes into account graph
   structural information and data access patterns of sampling-based GNN
   training simultaneously. Furthermore, to scale out on multiple GPUs,
   PaGraph develops a fast GNN-computation-aware partition algorithm to
   avoid cross-partition access during data-parallel training and achieves
   better cache efficiency. Finally, it overlaps data loading and GNN
   computation for further hiding loading costs. Evaluations on two
   representative GNN models, GCN and GraphSAGE, using two sampling
   methods, Neighbor and Layer-wise, show that PaGraph could eliminate the
   data loading time from the GNN training pipeline, and achieve up to 4.8x
   performance speedup over the state-of-the-art baselines. Together with
   preprocessing optimization, PaGraph further delivers up to 16.0x
   end-to-end speedup.

AB Background: Accurate detection of bleeding events from electronic health
   records (EHRs) is crucial for identifying and characterizing different
   common and serious medical problems. To extract such information from
   EHRs, it is essential to identify the relations between bleeding events
   and related clinical entities (eg, bleeding anatomic sites and lab
   tests). With the advent of natural language processing (NLP) and deep
   learning (DL)-based techniques, many studies have focused on their
   applicability for various clinical applications. However, no prior work
   has utilized DL to extract relations between bleeding events and
   relevant entities.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate multiple DL systems on a
   novel EHR data set for bleeding event-related relation classification.
   Methods: We first expert annotated a new data set of 1046 deidentified
   EHR notes for bleeding events and their attributes. On this data set, we
   evaluated three state-of-the-art DL architectures for the bleeding event
   relation classification task, namely, convolutional neural network
   (CNN), attention-guided graph convolutional network (AGGCN), and
   Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We used
   three BERT-based models, namely, BERT pretrained on biomedical data
   (BioBERT), BioBERT pretrained on clinical text (Bio+Clinical BERT), and
   BioBERT pretrained on EHR notes (EhrBERT).
   Results: Our experiments showed that the BERT-based models significantly
   outperformed the CNN and AGGCN models. Specifically, BioBERT achieved a
   macro F1 score of 0.842, outperforming both the AGGCN (macro F1 score,
   0.828) and CNN models (macro F1 score, 0.763) by 1.4% (P<.001) and 7.9%
   (P<.001), respectively.
   Conclusions: In this comprehensive study, we explored and compared
   different DL systems to classify relations between bleeding events and
   other medical concepts. On our corpus, BERT-based models outperformed
   other DL models for identifying the relations of bleeding-related
   entities. In addition to pretrained contextualized word representation,
   BERT-based models benefited from the use of target entity representation
   over traditional sequence representation

AB Collaborative filtering approach greatly promotes the development and
   application of personalized recommendation. In location-based social
   networks (LBSNs), the sparsity of check-in data is one of the main
   obstacles for traditional Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation models.
   Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an efficient tool to overcome this
   kind of problems, which enhances the representational ability of
   embeddings by capture high-order connectivity of users and POIs. In real
   applications, social tie is a crucial factor for POI recommendation that
   ignored in most current graph-based methods. Moreover, most message
   aggregation functions fail to capture contextual information. To address
   these problems, a novel framework named Friends-aware Graph
   Collaborative Filtering (FG-CF) is proposed in this paper, which
   incorporates social information into a user-POI graph. Firstly, a
   user-POI correlation matrix is estimated by check-in data and social
   links, and then, user embedding is updated according to the user-POI
   correlation matrix. Secondly, interaction messages are constructed in a
   novel way by integrating nodes' ego embeddings, neighbors' embeddings
   and social embeddings. Thirdly, by aggregating previous state embeddings
   and non-linear combination of neighbor messages with interaction
   messages, a new message aggregation function is present to update user
   and POI embeddings. Fourthly, we concatenate embeddings from each
   additional interaction layer to get the final embeddings, and inner
   product is used to compute the preference score of a user to a targeted
   POI. Finally, extensive experiments on two largescale LBSN datasets
   demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art
   approaches.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB COVID-19 has become a matter of serious concern over the last few years.
   It has adversely affected numerous people around the globe and has led
   to the loss of billions of dollars of business capital. In this paper,
   we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Transformer
   network (STSGT) to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependency
   of the COVID-19 time series data and forecast the future status of an
   evolving pandemic. The layers of STSGT combine the graph convolution
   network (GCN) with the self-attention mechanism of transformers on a
   synchronous spatial-temporal graph to capture the dynamically changing
   pattern of the COVID time series. The spatial-temporal synchronous graph
   simultaneously captures the spatial and temporal dependencies between
   the vertices of the graph at a given and subsequent time-steps, which
   helps capture the heterogeneity in the time series and improve the
   forecasting accuracy. Our extensive experiments on two publicly
   available real-world COVID-19 time series datasets demonstrate that
   STSGT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that were
   designed for spatial-temporal forecasting tasks. Specifically, on
   average over a 12-day horizon, we observe a potential improvement of
   12.19% and 3.42% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over the next best
   algorithm while forecasting the daily infected and death cases
   respectively for the 50 states of US and Washington, D.C. Additionally,
   STSGT also outperformed others when forecasting the daily infected cases
   at the state level, e.g., for all the counties in the State of Michigan.

AB Simple Summary
   The traditional process of drug development is lengthy, time-consuming,
   and costly, whereas very few drugs ever make it to the clinic. The use
   of computational methods to detect drug side effects greatly reduces the
   deficiencies in drug clinical trials. Prediction of drug-target
   interactions is a key step in drug discovery and repositioning. In this
   article, we proposed a novel method for the prediction of drug-target
   interactions based on large-scale graph representation learning. This
   method can be helpful to researchers in clinical trials and drug
   research and development.
   Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a significant step
   in the drug discovery or repositioning process. Compared with the
   time-consuming and labor-intensive in vivo experimental methods, the
   computational models can provide high-quality DTI candidates in an
   instant. In this study, we propose a novel method called LGDTI to
   predict DTIs based on large-scale graph representation learning. LGDTI
   can capture the local and global structural information of the graph.
   Specifically, the first-order neighbor information of nodes can be
   aggregated by the graph convolutional network (GCN); on the other hand,
   the high-order neighbor information of nodes can be learned by the graph
   embedding method called DeepWalk. Finally, the two kinds of feature are
   fed into the random forest classifier to train and predict potential
   DTIs. The results show that our method obtained area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9455 and area under the
   precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.9491 under 5-fold cross-validation.
   Moreover, we compare the presented method with some existing
   state-of-the-art methods. These results imply that LGDTI can efficiently
   and robustly capture undiscovered DTIs. Moreover, the proposed model is
   expected to bring new inspiration and provide novel perspectives to
   relevant researchers.

AB Context: Most defect prediction methods consider a series of traditional
   manually designed static code metrics. However, only using these
   hand-crafted features is impractical. Some researchers use the
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture the potential semantic
   information based on the program's Syntax Trees (ASTs). In recent years,
   leveraging the dependency relationships between software modules to
   construct a software network and using network embedding models to
   capture the structural information have been helpful in defect
   prediction. This paper simultaneously takes the semantic and structural
   information into account and proposes a method called CGCN. Objective:
   This study aims to validate the feasibility and performance of the
   proposed method in software defect prediction. Method: Abstract Syntax
   Trees and a Class Dependency Network (CDN) are first generated based on
   the source code. For ASTs, symbolic tokens are extracted and encoded
   into vectors. The numerical vectors are then used as input to the CNN to
   capture the semantic information. For CDN, a Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) is used to learn the structural information of the network
   automatically. Afterward, the learned semantic and structural
   information are combined with different weights. Finally, we concatenate
   the learned features with traditional hand-crafted features to train a
   classifier for more accurate defect prediction. Results: The proposed
   method outperforms the state-of-the-art defect prediction models for
   both within-project prediction (including within-version and
   cross-version) and cross-project prediction on 21 open-source projects.
   In general, within-version prediction achieves better performance in the
   three prediction tasks.Conclusion: The proposed method of combining
   semantic and structural information can improve the performance of
   software defect prediction.

AB Zero-shot action recognition can recognize samples of unseen classes
   that are unavailable in training by exploring common latent semantic
   representation in samples. However, most methods neglected the
   connotative relation and extensional relation between the action
   classes, which leads to the poor generalization ability of the zero-shot
   learning. Furthermore, the learned classifier inclines to predict the
   samples of seen class, which leads to poor classification performance.
   To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stage deep neural network
   for zero-shot action recognition, which consists of a feature generation
   sub-network serving as the sampling stage and a graph attention
   sub-network serving as the classification stage. In the sampling stage,
   we utilize generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained by action
   features and word vectors of seen classes to synthesize the action
   features of unseen classes, which can balance the training sample data
   of seen classes and unseen classes. In the classification stage, we
   construct a knowledge graph (KG) based on the relationship between word
   vectors of action classes and related objects, and propose a graph
   convolution network (GCN) based on attention mechanism, which
   dynamically updates the relationship between action classes and objects,
   and enhances the generalization ability of zero-shot learning. In both
   stages, we all use word vectors as bridges for feature generation and
   classifier generalization from seen classes to unseen classes. We
   compare our method with state-of-theart methods on UCF101 and HMDB51
   datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves
   the classification performance of the trained classifier and achieves
   higher accuracy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) initiates and
   regulates translation initiation in eukaryotes. eIF2B gene mutations
   cause leukoencephalopathy called vanishing white matter disease (VWM) in
   humans and slow growth (Slg-) and general control derepression (Gcd-)
   phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   RESULTS: To suppress eIF2B mutations, S. cerevisiae genomic DNA library
   was constructed in high-copy vector (YEp24) and transformed into eIF2B
   mutant S. cerevisiae strains. The library was screened for wild-type
   genes rescuing S. cerevisiae (Slg-) and (Gcd-) phenotypes. A genomic
   clone, Suppressor-I (Sup-I), rescued S. cerevisiae Slg- and Gcd-
   phenotypes (gcd7-201 gcn2∆). The YEp24/Sup-I construct contained
   truncated TAN1, full length EMC4, full length YGL230C, and truncated
   SAP4 genes. Full length EMC4 (chaperone protein) gene was sub-cloned
   into pEG (KG) yeast expression vector and overexpressed in gcd7-201
   gcn2∆ strain which suppressed the Slg- and Gcd- phenotype. A GST-Emc4
   fusion protein of 47kDa was detected by western blotting using alpha-GST
   antibodies. Suppression was specific to gcd7-201 gcn2∆ mutation in
   eIF2Bbeta and Gcd1-502 gcn2∆ in eIF2Bgamma subunit. Emc4p overexpression
   also protected the wild type and mutant (gcd7-201 gcn2∆, GCD7 gcn2∆, and
   GCD7 GCN2∆) strains from H2O2, ethanol, and caffeine stress.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Emc4p is involved in
   eIF2B-mediated translational regulation under stress and could provide
   an amenable tool to understand the eIF2B-mediated defects.

AB Natural product biosynthetic pathways are replete with enzymes
   repurposed for new catalytic functions. In some modular polyketide
   synthase (PKS) pathways, a GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT)-like
   enzyme with an additional decarboxylation function initiates
   biosynthesis. Here, we probe two PKS GNAT-like domains for the dual
   activities of S-acyl transfer from coenzyme A (CoA) to an acyl carrier
   protein (ACP) and decarboxylation. The GphF and CurA GNAT-like domains
   selectively decarboxylate substrates that yield the anticipated pathway
   starter units. The GphF enzyme lacks detectable acyl transfer activity,
   and a crystal structure with an isobutyryl-CoA product analog reveals a
   partially occluded acyltransfer acceptor site. Further analysis
   indicates that the CurA GNAT-like domain also catalyzes only
   decarboxylation, and the initial acyl transfer is catalyzed by an
   unidentified enzyme. Thus, PKS GNAT-like domains are re-classified as
   GNAT-like decarboxylases. Two other decarboxylases, malonyl-CoA
   decarboxylase and EryM, reside on distant nodes of the superfamily,
   illustrating the adaptability of the GNAT fold.

AB Dimetridazole (DMZ) is an antimicrobial drug used to treat bacterial and
   protozoan infections in humans and poultry farms. An excessive dosage of
   DMZ can be life-threatening, as it has carcinogenic effects. Hence,
   ensuring that DMZ remains at a very low level in the environment is
   essential for day-to-day human life. Herein, we report the development
   of a novel biocomposite using kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CGN)
   functionalized with gadolinium tin oxide nanoparticles (NPs),
   kappa-CGN/GdSnO(2)NPs, for the effective electrochemical detection of
   DMZ. The biocomposites, kappa-GCN/GdSnO(2)NPs, were successfully
   synthesized by the sonochemical method, and their structural features
   were evaluated using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. A
   glassy carbon electrode was coated with the synthesized
   kappa-CGN/GdSnO(2)NPs, it was used as an electrode surface modifier
   material for the detection of DMZ, and it exhibited excellent
   electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the modified electrode showed
   many advantages, such as a lower detection limit (3.1 nM), wide linear
   range (0.019-708.8 mu M), good sensitivity (0.62 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)),
   and high selectivity in the presence of co-interfering species. The
   designed kappa-CGN/GdSnO(2)NPs-based composite material can contribute
   to outstanding sensor performance in aquatic samples because of its
   repeatability, reproducibility, storage stability, and satisfactory
   accuracy. Therefore, kappa-CGN/GdSnO(2)NPs could be used to develop
   potential electrode modifier materials for electrochemical sensor
   applications and to detect toxic components, such as DMZ, in
   environmental aquatic samples.

AB Exploiting relationship among samples in cross-modal data plays a key
   role in the task of cross modal retrieval, but most of existing methods
   only extract the correlation from pairwise samples and ignore the
   relations of unpaired samples. Some graph regularization methods
   proposed a reasonable paradigm to exploit the correlation from multiple
   samples. However, limited by the traditional framework, the performance
   has much room to improve. Moreover, although some existing DNN-based
   methods achieve excellent performance, the requirement of massive
   labeled data is also a shortcoming. In this paper, we propose a novel
   semi-supervised method, named Semi-supervised Constrained Graph
   Convolutional Network (SCGCN), which adopts graph convolutional network
   to exploit correlation from batch samples of data with different
   modalities. For reducing the requirement of labeled data, we design a
   two stage training procedure: deep supervised learning stage and
   unsupervised learning stage. In deep supervised learning stage, we
   integrate two DNN-based semantic encoding networks and a shared
   classifier into Deep Cross-modal Semantic Encoding (DCSE) module which
   is trained by supervised learning with labeled data. From DCSE module,
   we learn a temporary modality-invariant space where the semantic
   embeddings of samples with different modalities are modality-invariant,
   and we also learn a classifier which can generate predicted label from
   the unlabeled data. In unsupervised learning stage, for fully exploiting
   the correlation from cross-modal data, we design a Constrained Graph
   Convolutional Network (CGCN) module which utilizes GCN to exploit the
   correlation and adopts both intra-modal discriminative loss and
   inter-modal pairwise similar loss to ensure the generated common
   representation modality-invariant and semantical discriminative. We
   perform extensive experiments on four conventional datasets and a large
   scale dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.

AB Air pollution is a serious environmental problem that has attracted much
   attention. Air quality prediction can provide useful information for
   urban environmental governance decision-making and residents' daily
   health control. However, existing research methods have suffered from a
   weak ability to capture the spatial correlations and fail to model the
   long-term temporal dependencies of air quality. To overcome these
   limitations, we propose a multi-scale spatiotemporal graph convolution
   network (MST-GCN), which consists of a multi-scale block, several
   spatial-temporal blocks and a fusion block. We first divide the
   extracted features into several groups based on their domain categories,
   and represent the spatial correlations across stations as two graphs.
   Then we combine the grouped features and the constructed graphs in pairs
   to form a multi-scale block that feeds into spatial-temporal blocks.
   Each spatial-temporal block contains a graph convolution layer and a
   temporal convolution layer, which can model the spatial correlations and
   long-term temporal dependencies. To capture the group interactions, we
   use a fusion block to fuse multiple groups. Extensive experiments on a
   real-world dataset demonstrate that our model achieves the highest
   performance compared with state-of-the-art and baseline models for air
   quality prediction.

AB Zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen categories by learning an
   embedding space between data samples and semantic representations. For
   the large-scale datasets with thousands of categories, embedding vectors
   of category labels are often used for semantic representation since it
   is difficult to define the semantic attributes of categories manually.
   Facing the problem of underutilization of prior knowledge during the
   construction of embedding vectors, this paper first constructs a novel
   knowledge graph as the supplement to the basic WordNet graph, and then
   proposes a fast hybrid model ARGCN-DKG, which means Attention based
   Residual Graph Convolutional Network on Different types of Knowledge
   Graphs. By introducing residual mechanism and attention mechanism, and
   integrating different knowledge graphs, the accuracy of knowledge
   transfer between different categories can be improved. Our model only
   use 2-layer GCN, the pretrained image features and category semantic
   features, so the training process could be done in minitues on single
   GPU, which could be one of the fastest training models for large-scale
   image recognition. Experiment results demonstrate that ARGCN-DKG model
   could get better results for large-scale datasets than the
   state-of-the-art model.

AB How to generalize and unify different few-shot learning tasks using
   neural network model is a difficult problem in the field of machine
   learning research. Aiming at the problem that the parameters of existing
   few-shot learning models cannot adapt with heterogeneous classification
   tasks, inspired by the human being recognition process, a hybrid neural
   network (HNN) model for large-scale heterogeneous classification tasks
   in few-shot learning is proposed. First, a meta-learning model is
   constructed, which uses a siamese graph convolutional network (SGCN)
   structure as bone network. The SGCN is trained by semi-supervised way
   with a small amount of incomplete labeled data. Then, random task
   slicing by group is performed according to the task size and
   meta-learning dimensions to ensure that the segmented task size matches
   the meta-learning model. Combined with the meta-learning model, a task
   discrimination network and object recognition network are constructed,
   to perform heterogeneous classification tasks while keeping the scale of
   HNN network parameters unchanged. Experimental results show that the HNN
   performs well under different datasets, and is suitable for large-scale
   heterogeneous tasks in few-shot learning without retraining.

AB Accurate and fine-grained individual air quality index (IAQI) prediction
   is the basis of air quality index (AQI), which is of great significance
   for air quality control and human health. Traditional approaches, such
   as time series, recurrent neural network or graph convolutional network,
   cannot effectively integrate spatial-temporal and meteorological factors
   and manage the dynamic edge relationship among scattered monitoring
   stations. In this paper, a ST-CCN-IAQI model is proposed based on
   spatial-temporal causal convolution networks. Both the spatial effects
   of multi-source air pollutants and meteorological factors were
   considered via spatial attention mechanism. Time-dependent features in
   the causal convolution network were extracted by stacked dilated
   convolution and time attention. All the hyper-parameters in ST-CCN-IAQI
   were tuned by Bayesian optimization. Shanghai air monitoring station
   data were employed with a series of baselines (AR, MA, ARMA, ANN, SVR,
   GRU, LSTM and ST-GCN). Final results showed that: (1) For a single
   station, the RMSE and MAE values of ST-CCN-IAQI were 9.873 and 7.469,
   decreasing by 24.95% and 16.87% on average, respectively. R-2 was 0.917,
   with an average 5.69% improvement; (2) For all nine stations, the mean
   RMSE and MAE of ST-CCN-IAQI were 9.849 and 7.527, respectively, and the
   R-2 value was 0.906. (3) Shapley analysis showed PM10, humidity and NO2
   were the most influencing factors in ST-CCN-IAQI. The Friedman test,
   under different resampling, further confirmed the advantage of
   ST-CCN-IAQI. The ST-CCN-IAQI provides a promising direction for
   fine-grained IAQI prediction.

AB Point cloud data can be produced by many depth sensors, such as Light
   Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RGB-D cameras, and they are widely
   used in broad applications of robotic navigation and remote -sensing for
   the understanding of environment. Hence, new techniques for object
   representation and clas-sification based on 3D point cloud are becoming
   increasingly in high demand. Due to the irregularity of the object
   shape, the point cloud-based object recognition is a very challenging
   task, especially the pose variances of a point cloud will impose many
   difficulties. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of pose variances
   in object classification based on point cloud by developing a novel
   end-to-end pose robust graph convolutional network. Technically, we
   first represent the point cloud using the spherical system instead of
   the traditional Cartesian system for simplicity of computation and
   representation. Then a pose auxiliary network is constructed with an aim
   to estimate the pose changes in terms of rotation angles. Finally, a
   graph convolutional network is constructed for object classification
   against the pose variations of point cloud. The experimental results
   show the new model outperforms the existing approaches (such as PointNet
   and PointNet++) on the classification task when conducting experiments
   on both the Model-Net40 and the ShapeNetCore dataset with a series of
   random rotations of a 3D point cloud. Specifically, we obtain 73.02%
   accuracy for classification task on the ModelNet40 with delaunay
   triangulation algo-rithm, which is much better than the state of the art
   algorithms, such as PointNet and PointCNN. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Few-shot learning (FSL) for human-object interaction (HOI) aims at
   recognizing various relationships between human actions and surrounding
   objects only from a few samples. It is a challenging vision task, in
   which the diversity and interactivity of human actions result in great
   difficulty to learn an adaptive classifier to catch ambiguous interclass
   information. Therefore, traditional FSL methods usually perform
   unsatisfactorily in complex HOI scenes. To this end, we propose dynamic
   graph-in-graph networks (DGIG-Net), a novel graph prototypes framework
   to learn a dynamic metric space by embedding a visual subgraph to a
   task-oriented cross-modal graph for few-shot HOI. Specifically, we first
   build a knowledge reconstruction graph to learn latent representations
   for HOI categories by reconstructing the relationship among visual
   features, which generates visual representations under the category
   distribution of every task. Then, a dynamic relation graph integrates
   both reconstructible visual nodes and dynamic task-oriented semantic
   information to explore a graph metric space for HOI class prototypes,
   which applies the discriminative information from the similarities among
   actions or objects. We validate DGIG-Net on multiple benchmark datasets,
   on which it largely outperforms existing FSL approaches and achieves
   state-of-the-art results.

AB Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is a long-standing research topic in
   computer vision. Existing methods mainly focus on category-level or
   instance-level image retrieval. This paper investigates the fine-grained
   scene-level SBIR problem where a free-hand sketch depicting a scene is
   used to retrieve desired images. This problem is useful yet challenging
   mainly because of two entangled facts: 1) achieving an effective
   representation of the input query data and scene-level images is
   difficult as it requires to model the information across multiple
   modalities such as object layout, relative size and visual appearances,
   and 2) there is a great domain gap between the query sketch input and
   target images. We present SceneSketcher-v2, a Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) based architecture to address these challenges.
   SceneSketcher-v2 employs a carefully designed graph convolution network
   to fuse the multi-modality information in the query sketch and target
   images and uses a triplet training process and end-to-end training
   manner to alleviate the domain gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate
   SceneSketcher-v2 outperforms state-of-the-art scene-level SBIR models
   with a significant margin.

AB Antibodies consisting of variable and constant regions, are a special
   type of proteins playing a vital role in immune system of the
   vertebrate. They have the remarkable ability to bind a large range of
   diverse antigens with extraordinary affinity and specificity. This
   malleability of binding makes antibodies an important class of
   biological drugs and biomarkers. In this article, we propose a method to
   identify which amino acid residues of an antibody directly interact with
   its associated antigen based on the features from sequence and
   structure. Our algorithm uses convolution neural networks (CNNs) linked
   with graph convolution networks (GCNs) to make use of information from
   both sequential and spatial neighbors to understand more about the local
   environment of target amino acid residue. Furthermore, we process the
   antigen partner of an antibody by employing an attention layer. Our
   method improves on the state-of-the-art methodology.

AB Human Action Recognition (HAR) has remained one of the most challenging
   tasks in computer vision. With the surge in data-driven methodologies,
   the depth modality has been effectively leveraged to solve this problem
   by many researchers over the years, mitigating many of the challenges of
   the two dimensional modalities. In this work, we investigate the
   methodologies and applications of 3D HAR primarily using the depth
   modality through a study of the end-to-end process of the
   state-of-the-art techniques . Challenges, future directions,
   availability of the datasets, and critical analysis regarding existing
   methods constitute a part of this paper. This survey aims to provide the
   reader with an up-to-date analysis in 3D HAR for those interested in
   further research.

AB Current human pose estimation methods mainly rely on designing efficient
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) frameworks. These CNN architectures
   typically consist of high-to-low resolution sub-networks to learn
   semantic information, and then followed by low-to-high sub-networks to
   raise the resolution to locate the keypoints. Because low-level features
   have high resolution but less semantic information, while high-level
   features have rich semantic information but less high resolution
   details, so it is important to fuse different level features to improve
   the final performance. However, most existing models implement feature
   fusion by simply concatenate low-level and high-level features without
   considering the gap between spatial resolution and semantic levels. In
   this paper, we propose a new feature fusion method for human pose
   estimation. We introduce high level semantic information into low-level
   features to enhance feature fusion. Further, to keep both the high-level
   semantic information and high-resolution location details, we use Global
   Convolutional Network blocks to bridge the gap between low-level and
   high-level features. Experiments on MPII and LSP human pose estimation
   datasets demonstrate that efficient feature fusion can significantly
   improve the performance. The code is available at:

AB Recently, fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) has become a hot topic in
   computer vision. Most of the advanced retrieval algorithms in this field
   mainly focus on the construction of loss function and the design of hard
   sample mining strategy. In this paper, we improve the performance of the
   FGIR algorithm from another perspective and propose an attention
   mechanism and context Information constraints-based image retrieval
   (AMCICIR) method for FGIR. It first applies an attention learning
   mechanism to gradually refine object location and extracts useful local
   features from coarse to fine. Then, it uses an improved graph
   convolutional network (GCN), where the adjacency matrix is dynamically
   adjusted with the current features and model retrieval performances
   during the model learning, to model the internal semantic interactions
   of the learned local features, so as to obtain a more discriminative and
   fine-grained image representation. Finally, various experiments are
   conducted on two fine-grained image datasets, CUB-200-2011 and Cars-196,
   and the experimental results show that the AMCICIR algorithm can
   outperform pervious state-of-the-art works remarkably.

AB Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has modeled the human
   skeleton as a graph convolution network (GCN), and has achieved
   remarkable results. However, most of the methods convolute directly on
   the whole graph, neglecting that the human skeleton is made up of
   multiple body parts, which cannot accomplish the task well. We recognize
   that the physical property of bones (i.e., length and direction) can
   provide identifiable information which helps effectively to build the
   multi-level network structure. As the existing methods treat the channel
   domain and the spatial domain with equal importance, many computing
   resources are wasted on neglectable features. In our paper, we modify
   the Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) and apply it to the
   adaptive network. By capturing the implicit weighted information in the
   channel domain and spatial domain, the network can focus more attention
   on the key channels and nodes. A new two-stream adaptive-attentional
   subgraph convolution network (2s-AASGCN) is proposed to extract features
   in the spatio-temporal domain. We validate 2s-AASGCN on two skeleton
   datasets, i.e., NTU-RGB+D60 and NTU-RGB+D120. Our model achieves
   excellent results on these two datasets.

AB The encoder-decoder framework is the main frame of image captioning. The
   convolutional neural network (CNN) is usually used to extract grid-level
   features of the image, and the graph convolutional neural network (GCN)
   is used to extract the image's region-level features. Grid-level
   features are poor in semantic information, such as the relationship and
   location of objects, while regional features lack fine-grained
   information about images. To address this problem, this paper proposes a
   fusion-features-based image-captioning model, which includes the fusion
   feature encoder and LSTM decoder. The fusion-feature encoder is divided
   into grid-level feature encoder and region-level feature encoder. The
   grid-level feature encoder is a convoluted neural network embedded in
   squeeze and excitation operations so that the model can focus on
   features that are highly correlated to the title. The region-level
   encoder employs node-embedding matrices to enable models to understand
   different node types and gain richer semantics. Then the features are
   weighted together by an attention mechanism to guide the decoder LSTM to
   generate an image caption. Our model was trained and tested in the MS
   COCO2014 dataset with the experimental evaluation standard Bleu-4 score
   and CIDEr score of 0.399 and 1.311, respectively. The experimental
   results indicate that the model can describe the image in detail.

AB Entity alignment refers to the process of discovering entities
   representing the same object in different knowledge graphs (KG).
   Recently, some studies have learned other information about entities,
   but they are aspect-level simple information associations, and thus only
   rough entity representations can be obtained, and the advantage of
   multi-faceted information is lost. In this paper, a novel node-level
   information strong fusion framework (SFEA) is proposed, based on four
   aspects: structure, attribute, relation and names. The attribute
   information and name information are learned first, then structure
   information is learned based on these two aspects of information through
   graph convolutional network (GCN), the alignment signals from attribute
   and name are already carried at the beginning of the learning structure.
   In the process of continuous propagation of multi-hop neighborhoods, the
   effect of strong fusion of structure, attribute and name information is
   achieved and the more meticulous entity representations are obtained.
   Additionally, through the continuous interaction between sub-alignment
   tasks, the effect of entity alignment is enhanced. An iterative
   framework is designed to improve performance while reducing the impact
   on pre-aligned seed pairs. Furthermore, extensive experiments
   demonstrate that the model improves the accuracy of entity alignment and
   significantly outperforms 13 previous state-of-the-art methods.

AB Background and objective: The Covid-19 pandemic significantly affects
   the global population's fitness and day-to-day life. The necessary
   action to fight against Covid is to have a fast, accurate and affordable
   diagnosis system. Most of the diagnostic systems available today have a
   low detection rate and are time consuming. Hence, there is a demand to
   design an affordable, accurate, and fast diagnostic system for Covid.
   The diagnostic system that uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   does not consider the complex correlation of multimodal image data, thus
   misleading the diagnostic results. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   provides a better solution for the complex representation of data, as it
   is modeled based on the pairwise relationship in the image features.
   Method: Diagnosis of Covid, Parasite, or Lung Tumor from X-ray images
   needs a more complex representative model. There is a demand to
   categorize the images grounded on highly complex features. To solve the
   issue mentioned earlier, this work proposes a Hypergraph- and
   convolutional neural network-based Fast and Accurate Diagnosis (FAT)
   system for Covid. The in-depth features are mined using a residual
   neural network from the X-ray images. The learning-based method
   optimizes a high-level correlation in the deep structures by
   constructing it as a hypergraph. Results: The proposed method is
   assessed based on the Covid dataset. The experimental outcomes show that
   the proposed system FAT provides the accuracy of 99.8%, sensitivity of
   99.5%, and specificity of 99%. It outperforms all the current diagnosis
   systems for Covid. Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based model is
   well suited for Covid diagnosis at the preliminary level. It allows
   diagnosing Covid by low radiation chest X-ray images with higher
   accuracy.

AB GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) is a serine/threonine-protein
   kinase that controls messenger RNA translation in response to amino acid
   availability and ribosome stalling. Here, we show that GCN2 controls
   erythrocyte clearance and iron recycling during stress. Our data
   highlight the importance of liver macrophages as the primary cell type
   mediating these effects. During different stress conditions, such as
   hemolysis, amino acid deficiency or hypoxia, GCN2 knockout (GCN2(-/-))
   mice displayed resistance to anemia compared with wild-type (GCN2(+/+))
   mice. GCN2(-/-) liver macrophages exhibited defective
   erythrophagocytosis and lysosome maturation. Molecular analysis of
   GCN2(-/-) cells demonstrated that the ATF4-NRF2 pathway is a critical
   downstream mediator of GCN2 in regulating red blood cell clearance and
   iron recycling.

AB The kinetochore is a multi-protein complex that drives chromosome
   segregation in eukaryotes. It assembles onto centromere DNA and
   interacts with spindle microtubules during mitosis and meiosis. Although
   most eukaryotes have canonical kinetochore proteins, kinetochores of
   evolutionarily divergent kinetoplastid species consist of at least 20
   unconventional kinetochore proteins (KKT1-20). In addition, 12 proteins
   (KKT-interacting proteins 1-12, KKIP1-12) are known to localize at
   kinetochore regions during mitosis. It remains unclear whether KKIP
   proteins interact with KKT proteins. Here, we report the identification
   of four additional kinetochore proteins, KKT22-25, in Trypanosoma
   brucei. KKT22 and KKT23 constitutively localize at kinetochores, while
   KKT24 and KKT25 localize from S phase to anaphase. KKT23 has a
   Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase domain, which is not found in any
   kinetochore protein known to date. We also show that KKIP1 co-purifies
   with KKT proteins, but not with KKIP proteins. Finally, our affinity
   purification of KKIP2/3/4/6 identifies a number of proteins as their
   potential interaction partners, many of which are implicated in RNA
   binding or processing. These findings further support the idea that
   kinetoplastid kinetochores are unconventional.

AB Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is the cornerstone of today's image
   retrieval systems. The most distinctive retrieval approach used,
   involves the submission of an image-based query whereby the system is
   used in the extraction of visual characteristics like the shape, color,
   and texture from the images. Examination of the characteristics is done
   for ensuring the searching and retrieval of proportional images from the
   image database. Majority of the datasets utilized for retrieval lean
   towards to comprise colored images. The colored images are regarded as
   in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) form. Most colored images use the RGB image
   for classifying the images. The research presents the transformation of
   RGB to other color spaces, extraction of features using different color
   spaces techniques, Gabor filter and use Convolutional Neural Networks
   for retrieval to find the most efficient combination. The model is also
   known as Gabor Convolution Network. Even though the notion of the Gabor
   filter being induced in CNN has been suggested earlier, this work
   introduces an entirely different and very simple Gabor-based CNN which
   produces high recognition efficiency. In this paper, Gabor Convolutional
   Networks (GCNs or GaborNet), with different color spaces are used to
   examine which combination is efficient to retrieve natural images. An
   extensive experiment using Cifar 10 dataset was made and comparison of
   simple CNN, ResNet 50 and GCN model was also made. The models were
   evaluated through a several statistical analysis based on accuracy,
   precision, recall, F-Score, area under the curve (AUC), and receiving
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results shows GaborNet model
   effectively retrieve images with 99.68% of AUC and 99.09% of Recall. The
   results also shows different images are effectively retrieved using
   different color space. Therefore research concluded it is very
   significance to transform images to different color space and use
   GaborNet for effective retrieval.

AB Sentiment Analysis is an essential research topic in the field of
   natural language processing (NLP) and has attracted the attention of
   many researchers in the last few years. Recently, deep neural network
   (DNN) models have been used for sentiment analysis tasks, achieving
   promising results. Although these models can analyze sequences of
   arbitrary length, utilizing them in the feature extraction layer of a
   DNN increases the dimensionality of the feature space. More recently,
   graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved a promising performance in
   different NLP tasks. However, previous models cannot be transferred to a
   large corpus and neglect the heterogeneity of textual graphs. To
   overcome these difficulties, we propose a new Transformer-based graph
   convolutional network for heterogeneous graphs called Sentiment
   Transformer Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study to model the sentiment corpus as a
   heterogeneous graph and learn document and word embeddings using the
   proposed sentiment graph transformer neural network. In addition, our
   model offers an easy mechanism to fuse node positional information for
   graph datasets using Laplacian eigenvectors. Extensive experiments on
   four standard datasets show that our model outperforms the existing
   state-of-the-art models.

AB We apply a heterogeneous graph convolution network (GCN) combined with a
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP) denoted by GCNMLP to explore the potential
   side effects of drugs. Here the SIDER, OFFSIDERS, and FAERS are used as
   the datasets. We integrate the drug information with similar
   characteristics from the datasets of known drugs and side effect
   networks. The heterogeneous graph networks explore the potential side
   effects of drugs by inferring the relationship between similar drugs and
   related side effects. This novel in silico method will shorten the time
   spent in uncovering the unseen side effects within routine drug
   prescriptions while highlighting the relevance of exploring drug
   mechanisms from well-documented drugs. In our experiments, we inquire
   about the drugs Vancomycin, Amlodipine, Cisplatin, and Glimepiride from
   a trained model, where the parameters are acquired from the dataset
   SIDER after training. Our results show that the performance of the
   GCNMLP on these three datasets is superior to the non-negative matrix
   factorization method (NMF) and some well-known machine learning methods
   with respect to various evaluation scales. Moreover, new side effects of
   drugs can be obtained using the GCNMLP.

AB Named entity disambiguation (NED) finds the specific meaning of an
   entity mention in a particular context and links it to a target entity.
   With the emergence of multimedia, the modalities of content on the
   Internet have become more diverse, which poses difficulties for
   traditional NED, and the vast amounts of information make it impossible
   to manually label every kind of ambiguous data to train a practical NED
   model. In response to this situation, we present MMGraph, which uses
   multimodal graph convolution to aggregate visual and contextual language
   information for accurate entity disambiguation for short texts, and a
   self-supervised simple triplet network (SimTri) that can learn useful
   representations in multimodal unlabeled data to enhance the
   effectiveness of NED models. We evaluated these approaches on a new
   dataset, MMFi, which contains multimodal supervised data and large
   amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments confirm the state-of-the-art
   performance of MMGraph on two widely used benchmarks and MMFi. SimTri
   further improves the performance of NED methods. The dataset and code
   are available at https://github.com/LanceZPF/NNED_MMGraph.

AB In this paper, we present a hybrid semantic affinity learning method
   (HSA) to capture and leverage the dependencies of categories for 3D
   semantic segmentation. Unlike existing methods that only use the
   cross-entropy loss to perform one-to-one supervision and ignore the
   semantic relations between points, our approach aims to learn the label
   dependencies between 3D points from a hybrid perspective. From a global
   view, we introduce the structural correlations among different classes
   to provide global priors for point features. Specifically, we fuse word
   embeddings of labels and scene-level features as category nodes, which
   are processed via a graph convolutional network (GCN) to produce the
   sample-adapted global priors. These priors are then combined with point
   features to enhance the rationality of semantic predictions. From a
   local view, we propose the concept of local affinity to effectively
   model the intra-class and inter-class semantic similarities for adjacent
   neighborhoods, making the predictions more discriminative. Experimental
   results show that our method consistently improves the performance of
   state-of-the-art models across indoor (S3DIS, ScanNet), outdoor
   (SemanticKITTI), and synthetic (ShapeNet) datasets.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a prominent and challenging
   issue in natural language processing tasks. It aims to analyze the
   emotion of the aspect words in given subjective sentences. A subjective
   sentence usually contains one or more aspect words, and there are
   potential associations between different aspect words. At present, many
   works in the literature ignore the potential relationship between aspect
   words. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an oriented inter-aspect
   modeling hierarchical network (IA-HiNET), which aims to mine and
   strengthen the relationship between different aspect words, and further
   realize the task of sentence-level sentiment analysis based on aspect
   words. Specifically, we introduce part-of-speech information and
   position information as a priori knowledge, and then construct a graph
   convolution network (GCN) based on sentence dependency to capture
   emotional cues related to aspect words. We design an aspect-oriented
   self-attention mechanism to map different aspect words with the same
   attribute into the same vector space to determine the correlation
   between different aspect words. Furthermore, we design a novel
   information gate mechanism to filter the emotional features unrelated to
   aspect words. The indicative importance between different aspect words
   is also used to assist the aspect-based sentence-level affective
   analysis task. We carry out experiments on four benchmark datasets, and
   excellent experimental results show the effectiveness of our model.

AB Among common tasks in natural language processing (NLP) domain, text
   classification is considered as an important primitive task which is
   widely applied in multiple disciplines. Recent advanced deep
   learning-based architectures such as sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) with
   attention mechanism have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
   multiple NLP's tasks, including classification. However, recent
   seq2seq-based models still encounter challenges related to the
   limitation in effectively capturing long-range dependent relationships
   between words in a text corpus. Recent integrated graph neural network
   and textual graph transformer (TGT)-based models have demonstrated
   significant improvements in preserving the structural n-hop co-occurring
   relationships between words in a given text corpus. However, these
   models still suffer problems related to the thorough considerations on
   the sequential and contextual relations of words within a single
   document's graph. To meet these challenges, in this article we proposed
   a novel semantic-enhanced graph transformer-based textual representation
   learning approach, called as: SemTGT. Our proposed SemTGT can support to
   effectively learn both local rich-contextual and global long-range
   structural latent representations of texts for leveraging the
   performance of classification task. Extensive experiments in standard
   datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SemTGT model in
   comparing with recent seq2seq-based and textual graph embedding-based
   baselines.

AB The pedestrian attribute recognition aims at generating the structured
   description of pedestrian, which plays an important role in
   surveillance. However, it is difficult to achieve accurate recognition
   results due to diverse illumination, partial body occlusion and limited
   resolutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive relationship
   framework for comprehensively describing and utilizing relations among
   attributes, describing different type of relations in the same
   dimension, and implementing complex transfers of relations in a GCN
   manner. This framework is named Correlation Graph Convolutional Network
   (CGCN). Based on the proposed framework, the feature vectors are built
   to associate attributes with image features and generate different
   relation matrices through self-attention among different feature
   vectors, describing different attribute relations. Then, we conduct
   multi-layer transfer of attribute relations by means of graph
   convolution, realizing complex utilization of attribute relations. In
   addition, the relations among attributes are fully exploited and two
   types of relations, namely the explicit and implicit relations, are
   proposed to be integrate into the proposed comprehensive relationship
   framework. The experimental results on RAP and PETA demonstrate that the
   recognition performance of the proposed CGCN can obviously outperform
   the state-of-the-arts, and moreover, the CGCN can achieve a better
   synergy with different relations.

AB The problem of route planning on road network is essential to many

   practical route planning strategy is required to supply the continuous
   route optimization considering the historic, current, and future traffic
   condition. However, few existing works comprehensively take into account
   these various traffic conditions during the route planning. Moreover,
   the LBSs usually suffer from extensive concurrent route planning
   requests in rush hours, which imposes a pressing need to handle numerous
   queries in parallel for reducing the response time of each query.
   However, this issue is also not involved by most existing solutions. We
   therefore investigate a parallel traffic condition driven route planning
   model on a cluster of processors. To embed the future traffic condition
   into the route planning, we employ a GCN model to periodically predict
   the travel costs of roads within a specified time period, which
   facilitates the robustness of the route planning model against the
   varying traffic condition. To reduce the response time, a Dual-Level
   Path (DLP) index is proposed to support a parallel route planning
   algorithm with the filter-and-refine principle. The bottom level of DLP
   partitions the entire graph into different subgraphs, and the top level
   is a skeleton graph that consists of all border vertices in all
   subgraphs. The filter step identifies a global directional path for a
   given query based on the skeleton graph. In the refine step, the overall
   route planning for this query is decomposed into multiple
   sub-optimizations in the subgraphs passed through by the directional
   path. Since the subgraphs are independently maintained by different
   processors, the sub-optimizations of extensive queries can be operated
   in parallel. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to confirm the
   effectiveness and superiority of the proposal.

AB The goal of this work is to recognize words, phrases, and sentences
   being spoken by a talking face without given the audio. Current deep
   learning approaches for lip reading focus on exploring the appearance
   and optical flow information of videos. However, these methods do not
   fully exploit the characteristics of lip motion. In addition to
   appearance and optical flow, the mouth contour deformation usually
   conveys significant information that is complementary to others.
   However, the modeling of dynamic mouth contour has received little
   attention than that of appearance and optical flow. In this work, we
   propose a novel model of dynamic mouth contours called Adaptive
   Semantic-Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (ASST-GCN), to go
   beyond previous methods by automatically learning both the spatial and
   temporal information from videos. To combine the complementary
   information from appearance and mouth contour, a two-stream visual
   front-end network is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art lip
   reading methods on several large-scale lip reading benchmarks.

AB Skeleton-based hand gesture recognition is an active research topic in
   computer graphics and computer vision and has a wide range of
   applications in VR/AR and robotics. Although the spatial-temporal graph
   convolutional network has been successfully used in skeleton-based hand
   gesture recognition, these works often use a fixed spatial graph
   according to the hand skeleton tree or use a fixed graph on the temporal
   dimension, which may not be optimal for hand gesture recognition. In
   this paper, we propose a two-stream graph attention convolutional
   network with spatial-temporal attention for hand gesture recognition. We
   adopt pose stream and motion stream as the two input streams for our
   network. In pose stream, we use the joint in each frame as the input; In
   motion stream, we use the joint offsets between neighboring frames as
   the input. We propose a new temporal graph attention module to model the
   temporal dependency and also use a spatial graph attention module to
   construct dynamic skeleton graph. For each stream, we adopt graph
   convolutional network with spatial-temporal attention to extract the
   features. Then, we concatenate the feature of the pose stream and motion
   stream for gesture recognition. We achieve the competitive performance
   on the main hand gesture recognition benchmark datasets, which
   demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

AB In the task of skeleton-based action recognition, long-term temporal
   dependencies are significant cues for sequential skeleton data.
   State-of-the-art methods rarely have access to long-term temporal
   information, due to the limitations of their receptive fields.
   Meanwhile, most of the recent multiple branches methods only consider
   different input modalities but ignore the information in various
   temporal scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-scale
   temporal transformer (MTT) in this letter, for skeleton-based action
   recognition. Firstly, the raw skeleton data are embedded by graph
   convolutional network (GCN) blocks and multi-scale temporal embedding
   modules (MT-EMs), which are designed as multiple branches to extract
   features in various temporal scales. Secondly, we introduce transformer
   encoders (TE) to integrate embeddings and model the long-term temporal
   pattern. Moreover, we propose a task-oriented lateral connection (LaC)
   aiming to align semantical hierarchies. LaC distributes input embeddings
   to the downstream transformer encoders (TE), according to semantical
   levels. The classification headers aggregate results from TE and predict
   the action categories at last. The proposed method is shown efficiency
   and universality during experiments and achieves the state-of-the-art on
   three large datasets, NTU-RGBD 60, NTU-RGBD 120 and Kinetics-Skeleton
   400.

AB Modulation in the constituent composition of heterojunction composite
   materials can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers and
   promote significant improvement towards visible light aided
   photocatalytic degradation of recalcitrant pollutants. Herein, a novel
   ternary heterojunction composite g-CN/CuFe2O4/MoS2 (CNCuMo) has been
   fabricated by improvising g-C3N4 as a fuel and the supporting matrix.
   The stable dual Zscheme heterojunction manifested superior visible light
   driven catalytic activity through efficient electron/hole (e-/h+)
   separation and generation of reactive species through peroxymonosulphate
   (PMS) activation. Various surface bound redox cycles play prominent
   roles in transport of photogenerated charge carriers, activation of
   adsorbed PMS species and generation of reactive radicals. Benefiting
   from their synergistic effects, visible light aided photocatalytic
   degradation of refractory antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was studied.
   98% CIP was degraded (with 74.8% mineralization) using 0.1 g/l of
   ternary composite with 10 wt% MoS2 (CNCuMo(10)) and 0.5 g/l of PMS,
   within 60 min of visible light irradiation. Scavenging experiments
   confirmed the simultaneous activity of both radical and non-radical
   species towards degradation. The system also exhibited satisfactory CIP
   degradation efficiency in various surface water matrixes. LCMS/MS
   analysis of the identified intermediates interpreted the probable
   degradation pathways of CIP molecules. Magnetic retrievability,
   recyclability for five cycles, good structural stability and low metal
   ion leaching tendency of the synthesized photocatalyst elucidate its
   potential application for degradation of emerging pollutants for water
   decontamination.

AB Gait recognition aims to identify people by the way they walk. Currently
   available gait recognition datasets mainly contain single-person gait
   data in relatively simple walking conditions, which limits research of
   robust gait recognition methods. In this paper, OG RGB+D dataset is
   presented to cope with this crucial limitation of other gait datasets.
   It includes the common walking conditions under occlusion in daily life,
   that is, those daily walking conditions in which people's normal walking
   patterns are occluded, including self-occlusion caused by views,
   occlusion caused by clothing or objects, and mutual occlusion between
   people. The dataset provides multi-modal data to support different types
   of methods, collected by multiple Azure Kinect DK sensors using
   synchronous data acquisition system (Multi-Kinect SDAS). Moreover, we
   propose a model-based gait recognition method SkeletonGait for gait
   recognition in walking conditions under occlusion, which learns
   discriminative gait features from human dual skeleton model composed of
   skeleton and anthropometric features through a siamese Spatio-Temporal
   Graph Convolutional Network (siamese ST-GCN). The experimental results
   show that SkeletonGait surpasses state-of-the-art methods in the case of
   severe occlusion. We believe that the introduction of our dataset will
   enable the community to apply, adapt, and develop various robust gait
   recognition methods. The dataset will be available at
   https://github.com/cvNXE/OG-RGB-D-gait-dataset.

AB Temporal action proposal generation is a fundamental yet challenging to
   locate the temporal action in untrimmed videos. Although current
   proposal generation methods can generate the precise boundary of
   actions, few focus on considering the relation of proposals. In this
   paper, we propose a unified framework to generate the temporal boundary
   proposals with a graph convolution network based on the boundary
   proposals' feature named Boundary Graph Convolutional Network (BGCN).
   BGCN draws inspiration from boundary methods and uses edge graph
   convolution relay on the boundary proposals' feature. First, we use a
   base layer to fusion the two-stream video features to get two-branches
   of base features. Then the two-branches of base features enter into the
   same structure of Proposal Features Graph Convolutional Network (PFGCN):
   Action PFGCN to extract the action classification score and Boundary
   PFGCN to extract the ending score and staring score. In proposal
   features graph convolutional network, we first densely sampled the
   proposals' feature from the video features. We construct a proposal
   feature graph, where each proposal feature as a node and their relations
   between proposals' features as an edge with edge convolution for graph
   convolution. After that, map the relations into a 2D map score.
   Experiments on popular benchmarks THUMOS14 demonstrate the superiority
   of BGCN over (44.8% versus 42.8% at tIoU 0.5) the state-of-the-art
   proposal generator (e.g., G-TAD, TAL-Net, and BMN) at any of tIoU
   thresholds from 0.3 to 0.7. On ActivityNet1.3, BGCN also got better
   results. Moreover, BGCN has high efficiency for action detection with
   less than 2 MB model size and fast inference time.
   GCN based on boundary generation for densely produce the action
   proposals Efficient and novel BGCN model has a great capability to learn
   the proposal features Has a lower model size for temporal action
   proposals generation Has fast inference time for temporal action
   proposals generation.

AB Road traffic forecasting is crucial in Intelligent Transportation
   Systems (ITS). To achieve accurate results, it is necessary to model the
   dynamic nature and the complex non-linear dependencies governing
   traffic. The goal is particularly challenging when the prediction
   involves more than just one traffic variable. This paper proposes a
   novel multi-task learning model, called AST-MTL, to perform
   multi-horizon predictions of the traffic flow and speed at the road
   network scale. The strategy combines a multilayer fully-connected neural
   network (FNN) and a multi-head attention mechanism to learn related
   tasks while improving generalization performance. The model also
   includes the graph convolutional network (GCNs) and the gated recurrent
   unit network (GRUs) to extract the spatial and temporal features of
   traffic conditions. Our experiments employ new sets of GPS data, called
   OBU data, to perform traffic prediction in the freeway and urban
   contexts. The experimental results prove our model can effectively
   perform multi-horizon traffic forecasting for different types of roads
   and outperform state-of-the-art models.

AB Human action recognition has been an attractive research topic in recent
   years due to its wide range of applications. Among existing methods, the
   Graph Convolutional Network achieves remarkable results by exploring the
   graph nature of skeleton data in both spatial and temporal domains.
   Noise from the pose estimation error is an inherent issue that could
   seriously degrade action recognition performance. Existing graph-based
   methods mainly focus on improving recognition accuracy, whereas
   low-complexity models are required for application development on
   devices with limited computation capacity. In this paper, a lightweight
   model is proposed by pruning layers, adding Feature Fusion and Preset
   Joint Subset Selection modules. The proposed model takes advantages of
   the recent Graph-based convolution networks (GCN) and selecting
   informative joints. Two graph topologies are defined for the selected
   joints. Extensive experiments are implemented on public datasets to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results
   show that the method outperforms the baselines on the datasets with
   serious noise in skeleton data. In contrast, the number of parameters in
   the proposed method is 5.6 times less than the baseline. The proposed
   lightweight models therefore offer feasible solutions for developing
   practical applications.

AB RNAs play crucial and versatile roles in cellular biochemical reactions.
   Since experimental approaches of determining their three-dimensional
   (3D) structures are costly and less efficient, it is greatly
   advantageous to develop computational methods to predict RNA 3D
   structures. For these methods, designing a model or scoring function for
   structure quality assessment is an essential step but this step poses
   challenges. In this study, we designed and trained a deep learning model
   to tackle this problem. The model was based on a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) and named RNAGCN. The model provided a natural way of
   representing RNA structures, avoided complex algorithms to preserve
   atomic rotational equivalence, and was capable of extracting features
   automatically out of structural patterns. Testing results on two
   datasets convincingly demonstrated that RNAGCN performs similarly to or
   better than four leading scoring functions. Our approach provides an
   alternative way of RNA tertiary structure assessment and may facilitate
   RNA structure predictions. RNAGCN can be downloaded from
   https://gitee.com/dcw-RNAGCN/rnagcn.

AB In object detection, non-maximum suppression (NMS) methods are
   extensively adopted to remove horizontal duplicates of detected dense
   boxes for generating final object instances. However, due to the
   degraded quality of dense detection boxes and not explicit exploration
   of the context information, existing NMS methods via simple
   intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics tend to underperform on
   multi-oriented and long-size objects detection. Distinguishing with
   general NMS methods via duplicate removal, we propose a novel graph
   fusion network, named GFNet, for multi-oriented object detection. Our
   GFNet is extensible and adaptively fuse dense detection boxes to detect
   more accurate and holistic multi-oriented object instances.
   Specifically, we first adopt a locality-aware clustering algorithm to
   group dense detection boxes into different clusters. We will construct
   an instance sub-graph for the detection boxes belonging to one cluster.
   Then, we propose a graph-based fusion network via Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) to learn to reason and fuse the detection boxes for
   generating final instance boxes. Extensive experiments both on public
   available multi-oriented text datasets (including MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015,
   ICDAR2017-MLT) and multi-oriented object datasets (DOTA) verify the
   effectiveness and robustness of our method against general NMS methods
   in multi-oriented object detection.

AB Recently, graph-based hashing that learns similarity-preserving binary
   codes via an affinity graph has been extensively studied for large-scale
   image retrieval. However, most graph-based hashing methods resort to
   intractable binary quadratic programs, making them unscalable to massive
   data. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional
   network-based hashing framework, dubbed GCNH, which directly carries out
   spectral convolution operations on both an image set and an affinity
   graph built over the set, naturally yielding similarity-preserving
   binary embedding. GCNH fundamentally differs from conventional graph
   hashing methods which adopt an affinity graph as the only learning
   guidance in an objective function to pursue the binary embedding. As the
   core ingredient of GCNH, we introduce an intuitive asymmetric graph
   convolutional (AGC) layer to simultaneously convolve the anchor graph,
   input data, and convolutional filters. By virtue of the AGC layer, GCNH
   well addresses the issues of scalability and out-of-sample extension
   when leveraging affinity graphs for hashing. As a use case of our GCNH,
   we particularly study the semisupervised hashing scenario in this paper.
   Comprehensive image retrieval evaluations on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and
   ImageNet datasets demonstrate the consistent advantages of GCNH over the
   state-of-the-art methods given limited labeled data.

AB Extensive studies have been conducted on human action recognition,
   whereas relatively few methods have been proposed for hand action
   recognition. Although it is very natural and straightforward to apply a
   human action recognition method to hand action recognition, this
   approach cannot always lead to state-of-the-art performance. One of the
   important reasons is that both the between-class difference and the
   within-class difference in hand actions are much smaller than those in
   human actions. In this article, we study first-person hand action
   recognition from RGB-D sequences. To explore whether pretrained networks
   substantially influence accuracy, eight classic pretrained networks and
   one pretrained network designed by us are introduced for extracting
   RGB-D features. A Lie group is introduced for hand pose representation.
   Ablation studies are conducted to compare the discriminative power of
   the RGB modality, depth modality, pose modality, and their combinations.
   In our method, a fixed number of frames are randomly sampled to
   represent an action. This temporal modeling strategy is simple but is
   proven more effective than both the graph convolutional network (GCN)
   and the recurrent neural network (RNN), which are widely adopted by
   conventional methods. Evaluation experiments on two public data sets
   demonstrate that our method markedly outperforms recent baselines.

AB Spatial-temporal graph modeling plays an important role in the fields of
   transportation, meteorology, and social networks. Traffic flow
   prediction is a classic spatial-temporal modeling task. Existing methods
   usually do not take into account the asynchronous spatial-temporal
   correlation in traffic data. In addition, due to the complexity and
   variability of traffic data, long-term traffic forecasting is highly
   challenging. In order to solve the above problems, this article proposes
   a new deep learning-based asynchronous dilation graph convolution
   network (ADGCN) to model the spatial-temporal graphs. We mine the
   asynchronous spatial-temporal correlation in the traffic network, and
   propose the asynchronous spatial-temporal graph convolution (ASTGC)
   operation to extract this special relationship. Furthermore, we extend
   the dilated 1-D causal convolution to a graph convolution. The receptive
   field of the model increases exponentially with the increase of the
   network depth. Experiments are conducted on three public traffic data
   sets, and the results show that the prediction performance of ADGCN is
   better than the existing counterpart methods, especially in long-term
   prediction tasks.

AB Neural architecture search (NAS) adopts a search strategy to explore the
   predefined search space to find superior architecture with the minimum
   searching costs. Bayesian optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms
   (EA) are two commonly used search strategies, but they suffer from being
   computationally expensive, challenging to implement, and exhibiting
   inefficient exploration ability. In this article, we propose a neural
   predictor guided EA to enhance the exploration ability of EA for NAS
   (NPENAS) and design two kinds of neural predictors. The first predictor
   is a BO acquisition function for which we design a graph-based
   uncertainty estimation network as the surrogate model. The second
   predictor is a graph-based neural network that directly predicts the
   performance of the input neural architecture. The NPENAS using the two
   neural predictors are denoted as NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP, respectively.
   In addition, we introduce a new random architecture sampling method to
   overcome the drawbacks of the existing sampling method. Experimental
   results on five NAS search spaces indicate that NPENAS-BO and NPENAS-NP
   outperform most existing NAS algorithms, with NPENAS-NP achieving
   state-of-the-art performance on four of the five search spaces.

AB Online ride-hailing order forecasting is a very important part of the
   intelligent traffic dispatch system. Accurate order forecasting can
   reduce the flow of invalid vehicles and improve the user experience of
   online ride-hailing. We propose a multi-view deep long short-term memory
   (LSTM) network architecture (MultiView deep LSTM framework), which uses
   convolutional neural network and graph convolutional network to extract
   the temporal and spatial characteristics of online ride-hailing orders,
   obtains the correlation information between regional orders through the
   order view, regional speed view, and weather factor view, and then uses
   LSTM unit and attention unit to predict the order volume in real time.
   We use Didi Haikou, China's online ride-hailing dataset for training,
   compare it with the prediction algorithms of other articles, and
   experiment with different choices of the contrast framework. The
   experimental results show that our deep learning framework can
   effectively capture comprehensive spatio-temporal correlation and obtain
   better results. The model maintained good performance at 15 min, 30 min,
   and 1 h. Experiments conducted on the actual demand data onto
   ride-hailing from Didi Haikou data prove that our method is better than
   the latest method.

AB Label Distribution Learning (LDL) can better describe the real-world
   data by learning a set of label distributions instead of discrete binary
   labels. Particularly, hashing-based LDL has achieved promising
   performance due to its desirable advantages of fast similarity
   computation and extremely low storage cost. However, existing
   hashing-based LDL methods are still shallow learning methods, which
   cannot deeply capture the implicit data semantics, and meanwhile fail to
   fully model the semantic data relations. In this letter, we propose an
   effective and efficient Deep Discrete Hashing for Label Distribution
   Learning (DDH-LDL) method, which develops the first deep hashing
   framework for LDL. Specifically, DDH-LDL captures implicit semantic
   information by multi-layer non-linear transformation, and simultaneously
   preserves the modeled semantic relations of instances into hash codes
   via semantic message aggregation on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
   Furthermore, we elaborately design a discrete optimization module that
   is seamlessly integrated into our proposed deep hashing framework to
   reduce the binary quantization errors. Experiments on several widely
   tested datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method on both
   learning accuracy and efficiency.

AB In order to find a suitable designer team for the collaborative design
   crowdsourcing task of a product, we consider the matching problem
   between collaborative design crowdsourcing task network graph and the
   designer network graph. Due to the difference in the nodes and edges of
   the two types of graphs, we propose a graph matching model based on a
   similar structure. The model first uses the Graph Convolutional Network
   to extract features of the graph structure to obtain the node-level
   embeddings. Secondly, an attention mechanism considering the differences
   in the importance of different nodes in the graph assigns different
   weights to different nodes to aggregate node-level embeddings into
   graph-level embeddings. Finally, the graph-level embeddings of the two
   graphs to be matched are input into a multi-layer fully connected neural
   network to obtain the similarity score of the graph pair after they are
   obtained from the concat operation. We compare our model with the basic
   model based on four evaluation metrics in two datasets. The experimental
   results show that our model can more accurately find graph pairs based
   on a similar structure. The crankshaft linkage mechanism produced by the
   enterprise is taken as an example to verify the practicality and
   applicability of our model and method.

AB Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging produce
   high-resolution images; however, during surgery or radiotherapy, only
   low-resolution cone-beam CT and low-dimensional X-ray images can be
   obtained. Furthermore, because the duodenum and stomach are filled with
   air, even in high-resolution CT images, it is hard to accurately segment
   their contours. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on a
   graph convolutional network (GCN) to reconstruct organs that are hard to
   detect in medical images. The method uses surrounding detectable-organ
   features to determine the shape and location of the target organ and
   learns mesh deformation parameters, which are applied to a target organ
   template. The role of the template is to establish an initial
   topological structure for the target organ. We conducted experiments
   with both single and multiple organ meshes to verify the performance of
   our proposed method.

AB In recent years, with the rapid development of digital currency, digital
   currency brings us convenience and wealth, but also breeds some illegal
   and criminal behaviors. Different from traditional currencies, digital
   currency provides concealment to criminals while also exposing their
   behavior. The analysis of their behavior can be used to detect whether
   the current digital currency transaction is legal. There is a problem
   that most digital currency transactions are in compliance with laws and
   regulations, and only a small part of them uses digital currency to
   conduct illegal activities. It belongs to the problem of sample
   imbalance. It is quite challenging to accurately distinguish which
   transactions are legal and which are illegal in the massive digital
   currency transactions. For this reason, this study combines the mutual
   information and the traditional cross-entropy loss function and obtains
   the loss function based on the mutual information prior. The loss
   function based on the mutual information prior is that the bias of the
   category prior distribution is added after the output of the model
   (before the softmax), which makes the model consider category prior
   information to a certain extent when predicting. The experimental
   results show that the use of the loss function based on mutual
   information prior to the detection of digital currency illegal behavior
   has a good effect in SVM, DNN, GCN, and GAT methods.

AB With the widespread application of semantic segmentation in remote
   sensing images with high-resolution, how to improve the accuracy of
   segmentation becomes a research goal in the remote sensing field. An
   innovative Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed based on
   regional attention for improving the performance of the semantic
   segmentation framework for remote sensing images. The proposed network
   follows the encoder-decoder architecture of semantic segmentation and
   includes the following three strategies to improve segmentation
   accuracy. The enhanced GCN module is applied to capture the semantic
   features of remote sensing images. MGFM is proposed to capture different
   contexts by sampling at different densities. Furthermore, RAM is offered
   to assign large weights to high-value information in different regions
   of the feature map. Our method is assessed on two datasets: ISPRS
   Potsdam dataset and CCF dataset. The results indicate that our model
   with those strategies outperforms baseline models (DCED50) concerning
   F1, mean IoU and PA, 10.81%,19.11%, and 11.36% on the Potsdam dataset
   and 29.26%, 27.64% and 13.57% on the CCF dataset.

AB Local climate zone (LCZ) has become a new standard classification scheme
   in urban landscapes and showed great potential in urban climate
   research. Traditional classifiers and ordinary neural networks only
   consider the spectral or local spatial features of the pixel, ignoring
   the effect of nonlocal information on the LCZ classification. The graph
   convolutional network (GCN) has been used to exploit the relationship
   between adjacent and global land covers owing to the ability to conduct
   flexible convolution over graphs. In this work, we integrated a
   convolutional neural network and two GCNs into an end-to-end hybrid
   framework and generated LCZs directly from the original images. Local-,
   regional-, and global-level features were extracted and grouped
   complementarily to foster better performance. Experiments were conducted
   in six cities around the world to verify the effectiveness of our
   method. Results showed that the average classification accuracy of the
   six cities reached 0.956 and performed better than any other comparable
   model. Ablation experiments also demonstrated the mutual promotion of
   the different modules. Finally, the small sample experiment provided a
   practical reference for the LCZ classification in the absence of samples
   in future.

AB Given a question about an image, Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR)
   needs to provide not only a correct answer, but also a rationale to
   justify the answer. VCR is a challenging task due to the requirement of
   proper semantic alignment and reasoning between the image and linguistic
   expression. Recent approaches offer a great promise by exploring
   holistic attention mechanisms or graph-based networks, but most of them
   do implicit reasoning and ignore the semantic dependencies among the
   linguistic expression. In this paper, we propose a novel explicit
   cross-modal representation learning network for VCR by incorporating
   syntactic information into the visual reasoning and natural language
   understanding. The proposed method enjoys several merits. First, based
   on a two-branch neural module network, we can do explicit cross-modal
   reasoning guided by the high-level syntactic structure of linguistic
   expression. Second, the semantic structure of the linguistic expression
   is incorporated into a syntactic GCN to facilitate language
   understanding. Third, our explicit cross-modal representation learning
   network can provide a traceable reasoning-flow, which offers visible

AB Living objects are hard to grasp because they can actively dodge and
   struggle by writhing or deforming while or even prior to being contacted
   and modeling or predicting their responses to grasping is extremely
   difficult. This letter presents an algorithm based on reinforcement
   learning (RL) to attack this challenging problem. Considering the
   complexity of living object grasping, we divide the whole task into
   pre-grasp and in-hand stages and let the algorithm switch between the
   stages automatically. The pre-grasp stage is aimed at finding a good
   pose of a robot hand approaching a living object for performing a grasp.
   Dense reward functions are proposed for facilitating the learning of
   right hand actions based on the poses of both hand and object. Since an
   object held in hand may struggle to escape, the robot hand needs to
   adjust its configuration and respond correctly to the object's movement.
   Hence, the goal of the in-hand stage is to determine an appropriate
   adjustment of finger configuration in order for the robot hand to keep
   holding the object. At this stage, we treat the robot hand as a graph
   and use the graph convolutional network (GCN) to determine the hand
   action. We test our algorithm with both simulation and real experiments,
   which show its good performance in living object grasping. More results

AB This article presents a method for the trajectory prediction of
   surrounding vehicles and proactive longitudinal control of autonomous
   vehicles (AVs) in an urban road environment. A long short-term memory
   (LSTM)-based deep learning model is designed for the surrounding
   vehicles' trajectory prediction. In our model, the historical evolution
   of the relation between a target vehicle and lanes is considered to
   learn the driver's behavior in a lane-aware manner. Interaction among
   adjacent vehicles is captured based on a graph convolutional network
   (GCN), which uses a self-attention mechanism. Compared to other
   approaches, our prediction model utilizes environment information that
   is acquirable in AVs with local sensors. A model predictive control
   (MPC) is designed to derive the control inputs of acceleration for AVs.
   The proposed control method utilizes the prediction results of the
   target vehicle to give action requests to AV in a proactive manner
   considering both safety and ride quality. The results of comparative
   studies indicate that the proposed prediction model achieves improved
   accuracy compared to baselines. The control results provided by
   automated driving tests show that the proposed control algorithm applied
   by the LSTM-based prediction model enables AVs to achieve safety with
   respect to surrounding vehicles and provide ride comfort to passengers.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are useful in remote sensing (RS)
   image retrieval. It is found to be effective because, in a graph
   representation, the relative geometrical interactions between different
   regions (or segments) are appropriately captured, along with their
   region-wise features in their region adjacency graphs. Also, the
   attention mechanism has often been applied to the nodes to highlight the
   essential features in each node. In this regard, a significant amount of
   high-frequency information is missed since each image segment is
   effectively summarized within a single node. To account for this and
   increase the learning capacity, we propose to attend over the
   edge/adjacency matrix to highlight the interactions among meaningful
   regions that contribute to supervised learning from images. We exploit
   this novel edge attention mechanism together with node attention to
   highlight essential image context by allowing more importance to the
   meaningful neighboring regions that highlight a relevant node. We
   implement the proposed context-attended GCN framework for image
   retrieval on the benchmarked UC-Merced and the PatternNet datasets. We
   observe a notable improvement in the results compared to the state of
   the art.

AB More than 90% of neuroblastoma patients are cured in the low-risk group
   while only less than 50% for those with high-risk disease can be cured.
   Since the high-risk patients still have poor outcomes, we need more
   accurate stratification to establish an individualized precise treatment
   plan for the patients to improve the long-term survival rate.
   We focus on extracting features and providing a workflow to improve
   survival prediction for neuroblastoma patients. With a workflow for gene
   co-expression network (GCN) mining in microarray and RNA-Seq datasets,
   we extracted molecular features from each co-expressed module and
   summarized them into eigengenes. Then we adopted the lasso-regularized
   Cox proportional hazards model to select the most informative eigengene
   features regarding association to the risk of metastasis. Nine
   eigengenes were selected which show strong association with patient
   survival prognosis. All of the nine corresponding gene modules also have
   highly enriched biological functions or cytoband locations. Three of
   them are unique modules to RNA-Seq data, which complement the modules
   from microarray data in terms of survival prognosis. We then merged all
   eigengenes from these unique modules and used an integrative method
   called Similarity Network Fusion to test the prognostic power of these
   eigengenes for prognosis. The prognostic accuracies are significantly
   improved as compared to using all eigengenes, and a subgroup of patients
   with very poor survival rate was identified.
   We first compared GCNs mined from microarray and RNA-seq data. We
   discovered that each data modality yields unique GCNs, which are
   enriched with clear biological functions. Then we do module unique
   analysis and use lasso-cox model to select survival-associated
   eigengenes. Integration of unique and survival-associated eigengenes
   from both data types provides complementary information that leads to
   more accurate survival prognosis.

AB The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) brings
   volatile stochasticity, which significantly challenge the optimal
   dispatch of power systems. This paper aims at developing a
   cost-effective and robust policy for stochastic dynamic optimization of
   power systems, which improves the economy as well as avoiding the risk
   of high costs in some critical scenarios with small probability.
   However, it is hard for existing risk-neutral methods to incorporate
   risk measure since most samples are normal. For this regard, a novel
   risk-averse policy learning approach based on deep reinforcement
   learning with risk-oriented sampling is proposed. Firstly, a generative
   adversarial network (GAN) with graph convolutional neural network (GCN)
   is proposed to learn from historical data and achieve risk-oriented
   sampling. Specifically, system state is modelled as graph data and GCN
   is employed to capture the underlying correlation of the uncertainty
   corresponding to the system topology. Risk knowledge is the embedded to
   encourage more critical scenarios are sampled while aligning with
   historical data distributions. Secondly, a modified deep reinforcement
   learning (DRL) with risk-measure under soft actor critic framework is
   proposed to learn the optimal dispatch policy from sampling data.
   Compared with the traditional deep reinforcement learning which is
   risk-neutral, the proposed method is more robust and adaptable to
   uncertainties. Comparative simulations verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.

AB Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that will progressively change a
   person's mental state and cause serious social problems. Symptoms of
   schizophrenia are highly correlated to emotional status, especially
   depression. We are thus motivated to design a mental status detection
   system for schizophrenia patients in order to provide an assessment tool
   for mental health professionals. Our system consists of two phases,
   including model learning and status detection. For the learning phase,
   we propose a multi-task learning framework to infer the patient's mental
   state, including emotion and depression severity. Unlike previous
   studies inferring emotional status mainly by facial analysis, in the
   learning phase, we adopted a Cross-Modality Graph Convolutional Network
   (CMGCN) to effectively integrate visual features from different
   modalities, including the face and context. We also designed task-aware
   objective functions to realize better model convergence for multi-task
   learning, i.e., emotion recognition and depression estimation. Further,
   we followed the correlation between depression and emotion to design the
   Emotion Passer module, to transfer the prior knowledge on emotion to the
   depression model. For the detection phase, we drew on characteristics of
   schizophrenia to detect the mental status. In the experiments, we
   performed a series of experiments on several benchmark datasets, and the
   results show that the proposed learning framework boosts
   state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods significantly. In addition, we take a
   trial on schizophrenia patients, and our system can achieve 69.52 in mAP
   in a real situation.

AB Maximal subgraph mining is increasingly important in various domains,
   including bioinformatics, genomics, and chemistry, as it helps identify
   common characteristics among a set of graphs and enables their
   classification into different categories. Existing approaches for
   identifying maximal subgraphs typically rely on traversing a graph
   lattice. However, in practice, these approaches are limited to
   relatively small subgraphs due to the exponential growth of the search
   space and the NP-completeness of the underlying subgraph isomorphism
   test. In this work, we propose SCAMA, an approach that addresses these
   limitations by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy for efficient
   mining of maximal subgraphs. Our approach involves initially
   partitioning a graph database into equivalence classes using
   bootstrapped backbones, which are tree-shaped frequent subgraphs. We
   then introduce a learning process based on a novel graph convolutional
   network (GCN) to extract maximal backbones for each equivalence class. A
   critical insight of our approach is that by estimating each maximal
   backbone directly in the embedding space, we can avoid the exponential
   traversal of the graph lattice. From the extracted maximal backbones, we
   construct the maximal frequent subgraphs. Furthermore, we outline how
   SCAMA can be extended to perform top-������ largest frequent subgraph
   mining and how the discovered patterns facilitate graph classification.
   Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAMA in
   identifying almost perfectly maximal frequent subgraphs, while
   exhibiting approximately 10 times faster performance compared to the
   best baseline technique.

AB Abnormal event detection in videos plays an essential role for public
   security. However, most weakly supervised learning methods ignore the
   relationship between the complicated spatial correlations and the
   dynamical trends of temporal pattern in video data. In this paper, we
   provide a new perspective, i.e., spatial similarity and temporal
   consistency are adopted to construct Spatio-Temporal Graph-based CNNs
   (STGCNs). For the feature extraction, we use Inflated 3D (I3D)
   convolutional networks to extract features which can better capture
   appearance and motion dynamics in videos. For the spatio graph and
   temporal graph, each video segment is regarded as a vertex in the graph,
   and attention mechanism is introduced to allocate attention for each
   segment. For the spatial-temporal fusion graph, we propose a
   self-adapting weighting to fuse them. Finally, we build ranking loss and
   classification loss to improve the robustness of STGCNs. We evaluate the
   performance of STGCNs on UCF-Crime datasets (total 128 h) and
   ShanghaiTech datasets (total 317,398 frames) with the AUC score 84.2%
   and 92.3%, respectively. The experimental results also show the
   effectiveness and robustness with other evaluation metrics.

AB In this paper, we study the problem of traffic forecasting, which aims
   to predict the future traffic state of the road network. One key
   challenge is that the previous approaches lack discussion of capturing
   temporal dependencies, as well as spatial dependencies among locations
   in the traffic network. In addition, the long-term traffic prediction is
   not satisfied. In this paper, we propose a Traffic dYnamic gRaph modEl -
   TYRE - which is composed of a Graph Convolutional Network with Gated and
   Attention mechanisms. TYRE can learn the 'importance' of all adjacent
   and distant locations, control the aggregation of adjacent and distant
   neighbourhood information, and learn the temporal dependencies to
   support long effective historical sizes. We demonstrate the validity and
   effectiveness of our approach on two different traffic datasets (i.e.,
   PeMSD4 and PeMSD8). The result shows that compared to the related
   approaches, our model that captures temporal and spatial dependence
   yields substantially improved performance. When predicting traffic
   conditions for the next 120 min, on PeMSD8 dataset, our model shows
   almost 6.6% RMSE improvement, 10.9% MAE improvement, and 2.1% MAPE
   improvement over the previous state of the art. All source codes of this

AB The idea of the paper concentrates on an iterative learning process in
   Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) involved in two vital steps: one is a
   message propagation (message passing) step to aggregate neighboring node
   features via aggregators performed, and another is an encoding output
   step to encode node feature representations by using updaters. In our
   model, we propose a novel affinity-aware encoding as an updater in GCNs,
   which aggregates the neighboring nodes of a node while updating this
   node's features. By utilizing affinity values of our encoding, we order
   the neighboring nodes to determine the correspondence between encoding
   functions and the neighboring nodes. Furthermore, to explicitly reduce
   the model size, we propose a lightweight variant of our updater that
   integrates Depth-wise Separable Convolution (DSC) into it, namely
   Depth-wise Separable Graph Convolution (DSGC). Comprehensive experiments
   conducted on graph data demonstrate that our models' accuracy improved
   significantly for graphs of low-dimensional node features. Also,
   performed in the low-dimensional node feature space we provide
   state-of-the-art results on two metrics (Macro-f1 and Matthews
   correlation coefficient (MCC)). Besides, our models are robust when
   taking different low-dimensional feature selection strategies. (c) 2020

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been used to capture spatial
   correlation between multiple sensors for better performance of
   short-term water demand forecasting, which is essential for the
   implementation of smart water such as optimal scheduling and anomaly
   detection. However, the GCN assumes every sensor's importance to be the
   same and describes the spatial correlation purely from a data
   perspective. To resolve the two issues that affect prediction accuracy,
   this study proposes a weighting strategy and develops a spatial
   correlation-based GCN (SCGCN) prediction model. Self-attention mechanism
   is used to comprehensively analyze water demand data of every sensor and
   flow resistance between sensors (i.e., head loss along pipes),
   generating spatial correlation coefficients with the consideration of
   hydraulics. Then the coefficients are used as weights to aggregate
   neighboring sensors' data, extracting accurate input features for the
   SCGCN model. The study utilized real monitoring data to develop the
   SCGCN model and compare it with a traditional artificial neural network
   (ANN) model. Results show that the SCGCN model can outperform the ANN
   model, especially for multi-step prediction. The root mean square errors
   of 30, 45, and 60 min multi-step prediction cases are reduced by 4.4% to
   9.2% for different sensors.

AB Missing data imputation (MDI) is the task of replacing missing values in
   a dataset with alternative, predicted ones. Because of the widespread
   presence of missing data, it is a fundamental problem in many scientific
   disciplines. Popular methods for MDI use global statistics computed from
   the entire dataset (e.g., the feature-wise medians), or build predictive
   models operating independently on every instance. In this paper we
   propose a more general framework for MDI, leveraging recent work in the
   field of graph neural networks (GNNs). We formulate the MDI task in
   terms of a graph denoising autoencoder, where each edge of the graph
   encodes the similarity between two patterns. A GNN encoder learns to
   build intermediate representations for each example by interleaving
   classical projection layers and locally combining information between
   neighbors, while another decoding GNN learns to reconstruct the full
   imputed dataset from this intermediate embedding. In order to speed-up
   training and improve the performance, we use a combination of multiple
   losses, including an adversarial loss implemented with the Wasserstein
   metric and a gradient penalty. We also explore a few extensions to the
   basic architecture involving the use of residual connections between
   layers, and of global statistics computed from the dataset to improve
   the accuracy. On a large experimental evaluation with varying levels of
   artificial noise, we show that our method is on par or better than
   several alternative imputation methods. On three datasets with
   pre-existing missing values, we show that our method is robust to the
   choice of a downstream classifier, obtaining similar or slightly higher
   results compared to other choices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Real-world knowledge bases such as DBPedia, Yago, and Freebase contain
   sparse linkage connectivity, which poses a severe challenge to link
   prediction between entities. To cope with such data scarcity issues,
   recent models have focused on learning interactions between entity pairs
   by means of relations that exist between them. However promising, some
   relations are associated with very few tail entities or head entities,
   resulting in poor estimation of the relation interaction between
   entities. In this article, we break the sole dependency of modeling
   relation interactions between entity pairs by associating a triple with
   pairwise embeddings, i.e., distributed vector representations for pairs
   of word-based entities and relation of a triple. We capture the
   interactions that exist between pairwise embeddings by means of a
   Pairwise Factorization Model that employs a factorization machine with
   relation attention. This approach allows parameters for related
   interactions to be estimated efficiently, ensuring that the pairwise
   embeddings are discriminative, providing strong supervisory signals for
   the decoding task of link prediction. The Pairwise Factorization Model
   we propose exploits a neural bag-of-words model as the encoder, which
   effectively encodes word-based entities into distributed vector
   representations for the decoder. The proposed model is simple and enjoys
   efficiency and capability, showing superior link prediction performance
   over state-of-the-art complex models on benchmark datasets DBPedia5OK
   and FB15K-237.

AB Motivation: Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST)
   technologies enable the measurement of gene expression profiles while
   preserving cellular spatial context. Linking gene expression of cells
   with their spatial distribution is essential for better understanding of
   tissue microenvironment and biological progress. However, effectively
   combining gene expression data with spatial information to identify
   spatial domains remains challenging. Results: To deal with the above
   issue, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework
   named STMGCN for identifying spatial domains using multi-view graph
   convolution networks (MGCNs). Specifically, to fully exploit spatial
   information, we first construct multiple neighbor graphs (views) with
   different similarity measures based on the spatial coordinates. Then,
   STMGCN learns multiple view-specific embeddings by combining gene
   expressions with each neighbor graph through graph convolution networks.
   Finally, to capture the importance of different graphs, we further
   introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse view-specific
   embeddings and thus derive the final spot embedding. STMGCN allows for
   the effective utilization of spatial context to enhance the expressive
   power of the latent embeddings with multiple graph convolutions. We
   apply STMGCN on two simulation datasets and five real spatial
   transcriptomics datasets with different resolutions across distinct
   platforms. The experimental results demonstrate that STMGCN obtains
   competitive results in spatial domain identification compared with five
   state-of-the-art methods, including spatial and non-spatial
   alternatives. Besides, STMGCN can detect spatially variable genes with
   enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Overall, STMGCN
   is a powerful and efficient computational framework for identifying
   spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics data.

AB Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) are widely used for graph
   analysis. Specifically, in medical applications, GCNs can be used for
   disease prediction on a population graph, where graph nodes represent
   individuals and edges represent individual similarities. However, GCNs
   rely on a vast amount of data, which is challenging to collect for a
   single medical institution. In addition, a critical challenge that most
   medical institutions continue to face is addressing disease prediction
   in isolation with incomplete data information. To address these issues,
   Federated Learning (FL) allows isolated local institutions to
   collaboratively train a global model without data sharing. In this work,
   we propose a framework, FedNI, to leverage network inpainting and
   inter-institutional data via FL. Specifically, we first federatively
   train missing node and edge predictor using a graph generative
   adversarial network (GAN) to complete the missing information of local
   networks. Then we train a global GCN node classifier across institutions
   using a federated graph learning platform. The novel design enables us
   to build more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated
   learning and also graph learning approaches. We demonstrate that our
   federated model outperforms local and baseline FL methods with
   significant margins on two public neuroimaging datasets.

AB A sequential recommendation has become a hot research topic, which seeks
   to predict the next interesting item for each user based on his action
   sequence. While previous methods have made many efforts to capture the
   dynamics of sequential patterns, we contend that they still suffer from
   two inherent limitations: 1) they fail to model item transition patterns
   in an efficient and time-sensitive manner and 2) they are unaware of the
   importance of dynamically capturing social influence, resulting in
   suboptimal performance. We introduce a new concept dubbed
   socio-sequential recommendation, where the challenge mainly lies in
   dynamically modeling social influences and capturing item-to-item
   transition patterns in a time-sensitive manner. In light of this, we
   contribute a novel solution named GCARec (short for graph-augmented
   co-attention model), which takes into account the joint effect of
   dynamic sequential patterns and dynamic social influences. GCARec
   decomposes socio-sequential recommendation workflow into two steps.
   First, we adopt a light graph embedding module to model long-term user
   preference. Then, we propose a time-sensitive attention mechanism and a
   social-aware attention mechanism to capture dynamic patterns at
   sequential-level and social-level, respectively. Extensive experiments
   have been conducted on eight real-world datasets from different
   scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of GCARec against several
   state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets have been released at:

AB With recent advancements, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown
   considerable potential for various graph-related tasks, and their
   applications have gained considerable attention. However, adversarial
   attacks can significantly degrade the performance of GNNs, hindering
   their deployment in critical real-world tasks. GNNs must be robust
   against adversarial attacks, in which imperceptible adversarial
   perturbations are intro-duced to induce serious security issues. To
   achieve this goal, we propose a robust graph convolutional network,
   ERGCN, for node classification via data enhancement. ERGCN
   simultaneously utilizes properties from the "data domain" and "model
   space" as guidance. Based on the feature smoothness assumption, a graph
   structure enhancement (GSE) mech-anism is proposed to improve the
   structural reliability of input graphs. Moreover, inspired by
   self-training methods that assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled training
   samples and use them to optimize the target model iteratively, a
   reliable node selection metric, model boundary distance (MBD), is
   defined based on the distance from training samples to model decision
   boundary. Finally, a self-training-based robust graph convolutional
   network is proposed for node classification. Extensive experiments on
   three public datasets demon-strate the superiority of our model over
   existing state-of-the-art methods. Our study pro-vides a solution for
   trustworthy graph machine learning systems in adversarial environments.

AB Motivation: Proteins are ubiquitous molecules whose function in
   biological processes is determined by their 3D structure. Experimental
   identification of a protein's structure can be time-consuming,
   prohibitively expensive and not always possible. Alternatively, protein
   folding can be modeled using computational methods, which however are
   not guaranteed to always produce optimal results. GraphQA is a
   graph-based method to estimate the quality of protein models, that
   possesses favorable properties such as representation learning, explicit
   modeling of both sequential and 3D structure, geometric invariance and
   computational efficiency.
   Results: GraphQA performs similarly to state-of-the-art methods despite
   using a relatively low number of input features. In addition, the graph
   network structure provides an improvement over the architecture used in
   ProQ4 operating on the same input features. Finally, the individual
   contributions of GraphQA components are carefully evaluated.
   Availability and implementation: PyTorch implementation, datasets,
   experiments and link to an evaluation server are available through this

AB With the aim of constructing a low-dimensional representation space,
   Hyperbolic Knowledge Embeddings have gradually become a hot spot in
   various information retrieval and machine learning tasks. However, most
   of the existing Hyperbolic knowledge embedding methods focus on the
   shallow embedding, and often ignore the network structure
   characteristics (e.g., hierarchy) of Knowledge Graphs. Therefore, this
   paper designs a novel Hyperbolic Skipped Knowledge Graph Convolutional
   Network, HSKGCN, to improve link prediction accuracy with low embedding
   dimension requirements. Firstly, the model is designed based on the
   hyperbolic geometric operations on the Poincare ball, which can
   effectively utilize the characteristics of the hyperbolic geometry
   (e.g., Poincare ball) to capture the hierarchy of Knowledge Graphs;
   Secondly, each single-layer convolutional layer introduces the feature
   aggregation weight, which ensures the reasonable distribution of node
   features during the aggregation process; In addition, the
   skip-connection mechanism is applied to HSKGCN to weaken the information
   loss caused by the stacked of the graph convolutional layers; Finally,
   we evaluate HSKGCN on benchmark datasets, WN18RR and FB15k-237.
   Experiments show that HSKGCN achieves substantial improvements against
   state-of-the-art models on the 32-dimensional embedding task, and the
   results of different relations on WN18RR show graphs similar with tree
   topology can performer better. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Statistical relational learning (SRL) and graph neural networks (GNNs)
   are two powerful approaches for learning and inference over graphs.
   Typically, they are evaluated in terms of simple metrics such as
   accuracy over individual node labels. Complex aggregate graph queries
   (AGQ) involving multiple nodes, edges, and labels are common in the
   graph mining community and are used to estimate important network
   properties such as social cohesion and influence. While graph mining
   algorithms support AGQs, they typically do not take into account
   uncertainty, or when they do, make simplifying assumptions and do not
   build full probabilistic models. In this paper, we examine the
   performance of SRL and GNNs on AGQs over graphs with partially observed
   node labels. We show that, not surprisingly, inferring the unobserved
   node labels as a first step and then evaluating the queries on the fully
   observed graph can lead to sub-optimal estimates, and that a better
   approach is to compute these queries as an expectation under the joint
   distribution. We propose a sampling framework to tractably compute the
   expected values of AGQs. Motivated by the analysis of subgroup cohesion
   in social networks, we propose a suite of AGQs that estimate the
   community structure in graphs. In our empirical evaluation, we show that
   by estimating these queries as an expectation, SRL-based approaches
   yield up to a 50-fold reduction in average error when compared to
   existing GNN-based approaches.

   regulating the gene expression. The subcellular localization of miRNAs
   plays a crucial role in the discovery of their biological functions.
   Although several computational methods based on miRNA functional
   similarity networks have been presented to identify the subcellular
   localization of miRNAs, it remains difficult for these approaches to
   effectively extract well-referenced miRNA functional representations due
   to insufficient miRNA-disease association representation and disease
   semantic representation. Currently, there has been a significant amount
   of research on miRNA-disease associations, making it possible to address
   the issue of insufficient miRNA functional representation. In this work,
   a novel model is established, named DAmiRLocGNet, based on graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and autoencoder (AE) for identifying the
   subcellular localizations of miRNA. The DAmiRLocGNet constructs the
   features based on miRNA sequence information, miRNA-disease association
   information and disease semantic information. GCN is utilized to gather
   the information of neighboring nodes and capture the implicit
   information of network structures from miRNA-disease association
   information and disease semantic information. AE is employed to capture
   sequence semantics from sequence similarity networks. The evaluation
   demonstrates that the performance of DAmiRLocGNet is superior to other
   competing computational approaches, benefiting from implicit features
   captured by using GCNs. The DAmiRLocGNet has the potential to be applied
   to the identification of subcellular localization of other non-coding
   RNAs. Moreover, it can facilitate further investigation into the
   functional mechanisms underlying miRNA localization. The source code and
   datasets are accessed at .

AB The converter steelmaking process smelts hot metal to liquid steel and
   occupies an important position in industry. The composition of liquid
   steel at the endpoint is an essential quality index, including the
   concentrations of multiple elements, such as carbon, silicon, and
   manganese. Accurately predicting endpoint composition is the basis of
   production optimization. Hence, a multichannel diffusion graph
   convolutional network (MCDGCN) is presented in this article. Unlike
   conventional models, the developed MCDGCN describes the converter
   steelmaking process as a graph to exploit the correlations among element
   concentrations for an accurate endpoint composition prediction. We also
   develop a unique K-hop diffusion method to extract the globally
   consistent information over the graph for predicting each element. The
   proposed method addresses the composition prediction task for a
   realistic converter steelmaking process. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first time that up to 15 elements of liquid steel are
   covered and predicted to present a comprehensive process model. Compared
   with six benchmark models, MCDGCN presents state-of-the-art results,
   i.e., an average R-2 of 0.8475 and an average MAE of 0.0189, which shows
   that the correlation mining of graph deep learning can indeed improve
   the prediction performance for endpoint composition.

AB Predicting the therapeutic effect of anti-cancer drugs on tumors based
   on the characteristics of tumors and patients is one of the important
   contents of precision oncology. Existing computational methods regard
   the drug response prediction problem as a classification or regression
   task. However, few of them consider leveraging the relationship between
   the two tasks. In this work, we propose a Multi-task Interaction Graph
   Convolutional Network (MTIGCN) for anti-cancer drug response prediction.
   MTIGCN first utilizes an graph convolutional network-based model to
   produce embeddings for both cell lines and drugs. After that, the model
   employs multitask learning to predict anti-cancer drug response, which
   involves training the model on three different tasks simultaneously: the
   main task of the drug sensitive or resistant classification task and the
   two auxiliary tasks of regression prediction and similarity network
   reconstruction. By sharing parameters and optimizing the losses of
   different tasks simultaneously, MTIGCN enhances the feature
   representation and reduces overfitting. The results of the experiments
   on two in vitro datasets demonstrated that MTIGCN outperformed seven
   state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, the well-trained model on
   the in vitro dataset GDSC exhibited good performance when applied to
   predict drug responses in in vivo datasets PDX and TCGA. The case study
   confirmed the model's ability to discover unknown drug responses in cell
   lines.

AB Bearings are commonly used to reduce friction between moving parts.
   Bearings may fail due to lubrication failure, contamination, corrosion,
   and fatigue. To prevent bearing failures, it is important to predict the
   remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings. While many data-driven methods
   have been introduced, very few studies have considered the correlation
   of features at different time points, such a correlation could be used
   to identify and aggregate features at different time points for
   improving the robustness of predictive models. Moreover, many existing
   data-driven methods leverage neural networks with recurrent
   characteristics such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short
   term memory (LSTM). These methods are ineffective in processing long
   sequences and require longer training time due to the recurrent
   characteristics. To address these issues, a Siamese LSTM network is
   firstly introduced to classify degradation stages before predicting the
   RUL of bearings. Then we introduce a self-adaptive graph convolutional
   network (SAGCN) along with a self-attention mechanism in order to
   con-sider the correlation of features at different time points without
   using recurrent characteristics. Experimental results have demonstrated
   that the proposed method can accurately predict the RUL with a minimum
   average root mean squared error of 0.119, and outperforms existing
   data-driven methods, such as graph convolutional network, convolutional
   LSTM, convolutional neural network, and generative adversarial network.

AB The recommender system is of great significance to alleviate information
   overload. The rise of online social networks leads to a promising
   direction-social recommendation. By injecting the interaction influence
   among social users, recommendation performance has been further
   improved. Successful as they are, we argue that most social
   recommendation methods are still not sufficient to make full use of
   social network information. Existing solutions typically either
   considered only the local neighbors or treat neighbors' information
   equally, even or both. However, few studies have attempted to solve
   these social recommendation problems jointly from both the perspective
   of social depth and social strength. Recently, graph convolutional
   neural networks have shown great potential in learning graph data by
   modeling the information propagation and aggregation process. Thus, we
   propose an attention-based social aggregation neural networks
   (abbreviated as SAN) model to build a recommendation system. Different
   from previous work, our proposed SAN model simulates the recursive
   social aggregation process to spread the global social influence, and
   simultaneously introduces social attention mechanism to incorporate the
   heterogeneous influences for better model user embedding. Instead of a
   shallow linear interaction function, we adopt multi-layer perception to
   model the complex user-item interaction. Extensive experiments on two
   real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model SAN,
   and further analysis verifies the generalization and flexibility of the
   model.

AB Inferring the unseen attribute-object composition is critical to make
   machines learn to decompose and compose complex concepts like people.
   Most existing methods are limited to the composition recognition of
   single-attribute-object, and can hardly learn relations between the
   attributes and objects. In this paper, we propose an attribute-object
   semantic association graph model to learn the complex relations and
   enable knowledge transfer between primitives. With nodes representing
   attributes and objects, the graph can be constructed flexibly, which
   realizes both single- and multi-attribute-object composition
   recognition. In order to reduce mis-classifications of similar
   compositions (e.g., scratched screen and broken screen), driven by the
   contrastive loss, the anchor image feature is pulled closer to the
   corresponding label feature and pushed away from other negative label
   features. Specifically, a novel balance loss is proposed to alleviate
   the domain bias, where a model prefers to predict seen compositions. In
   addition, we build a large-scale Multi-Attribute Dataset (MAD) with
   116,099 images and 8,030 label categories for inferring unseen
   multi-attribute-object compositions. Along with MAD, we propose two
   novel metrics Hard and Soft to give a comprehensive evaluation in the
   multi-attribute setting. Experiments on MAD and two other
   single-attribute-object benchmarks (MIT-States and UT-Zappos50K)
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Recommendation system plays an important role in the rapid development
   of micro-video sharing platform. Micro-video has rich modal features,
   such as visual, audio, and text. It is of great significance to carry
   out personalized recommendation by integrating multi-modal features.
   However, most of the current multi-modal recommendation systems can only
   enrich the feature representation on the item side, while it leads to
   poor learning of user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose a
   novel module named Learning the User's Deeper Preferences (LUDP), which
   constructs the item-item modal similarity graph and user preference
   graph in each modality to explore the learning of item and user
   representation. Specifically, we construct item-item similar modalities
   graph using multi-modal features, the item ID embedding is propagated
   and aggregated on the graph to learn the latent structural information
   of items; The user preference graph is constructed through the
   historical interaction between the user and item, on which the
   multi-modal features are aggregated as the user's preference for the
   modal. Finally, combining the two parts as auxiliary information
   enhances the user and item representation learned from the collaborative
   signals to learn deeper user preferences. Through a large number of
   experiments on two public datasets (TikTok, Movielens), our model is
   proved to be superior to the most advanced multi-modal recommendation
   methods.

AB Aspect sentiment triplet extraction task detects three elements of
   fine-grained sentiment analysis from given sentence, including aspect
   and opinion terms and their sentiment polarity. Existing methods mainly
   include tagging-based and span-based methods, where the former show
   defects on handling overlapped triplets, and the latter could
   theoretically handle all overlapped triplets but lack of tailored
   inter-word dependency so that suffer from insufficient span semantic. In
   this paper, we propose a span-based dependency-enhanced graph
   convolutional network, which leverages contextual semantic and latent
   dependency to enrich span representations. Specifically, we devise a
   latent graph convolutional network to emphasize critical inter-word
   dependencies and cut off redundant connections in a learnable gating
   manner, improving the information flow during inter-word interaction. In
   addition, considering the problem of multi-word term sentiment
   consistency, we detect effective aspect and opinion terms derived from
   the output of span enumeration, and introduce term-level interactions by
   coupling, which meanwhile enables our model to deal with various types
   of triplets including many-to-one and one-to-many overlapped triplets.
   Extensive experiments over four benchmark datasets verify that the
   proposed method outperforms all the baselines with an average F1
   improvement of up to 6.13%, and meanwhile shows fine interpretability.
   The experimental results demonstrate that effectively enhancing
   token-level and term-level interactions can significantly improve the
   aspect sentiment triplet extraction performance.

AB Forecasting traffic inflows and outflows is crucial for intelligent
   transportation applications such as traffic management and risk
   assessment. Recently, deep learning models, which focus on capturing
   spatio-temporal correlations between stations (locations) by
   constructing Spatio-Temporal Feature Learners (STFL), have achieved
   promising performance in traffic inflows and outflows prediction.
   However, two unresolved issues limit the performance of these models. i)
   dynamic and heterogeneous intra-and inter-relationships between flows
   are ignored, and ii) the STFL in these models cannot capture the global
   information. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deep
   Spatio-Temporal Network framework based on Multi-Relational learning
   (MR-STN) for predicting traffic inflows and outflows. Specifically, a
   multi-relational learning module is designed to comprehensively model
   three kinds of relationships between flows while extracting diverse
   spatio-temporal features. In this module, an enhanced STFL is developed
   to capture both local and global information. Then, a feature fusion
   module is introduced to extract fused features for inflows and outflows
   respectively via a gated fusion mechanism. On this basis, the prediction
   module uses fusion features to generate future inflows and outflows.
   Finally, we implement the proposed framework with four state-of-the-art
   graph-based deep spatio-temporal models to demonstrate its generality
   and superiority. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that the
   proposed framework can significantly boost the performance of existing
   models.

AB In recent years, reviews and user-item interaction have been recognized
   as valuable information to improve representation learning abilities in
   recommendations. However, on the one hand, the existing review-based
   recommendations normally ignore the importance of sentiment words
   regarding the corresponding aspect words, which reflect user preference
   for the item aspect. On the other hand, when modeling interaction, both
   user-user and user-item interactions should be considered. To solve
   these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel sentiment-enhanced
   neural graph recommender by incorporating the information derived from
   both textual reviews and bipartite graph. Specifically, we first design
   a hierarchically structured attention mechanism with a sentiment
   auxiliary task to help the recommendation task learn user preference for
   different aspects of items from reviews, where the co-attention
   mechanism is used to select important item/user reviews for the current
   user/item. Second, we construct a user-item interaction graph to capture
   preference-based user-item interaction with social-based user-user
   interaction, where the graph convolutional network is used to simulate
   the diffusion of information. Finally, we adopt a Factorization Machine
   model to accomplish the recommendation task. The experimental results
   demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the related
   approaches w.r.t. rating prediction accuracy on Yelp and Amazon
   datasets. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data-driven fault diagnosis for critical industrial processes has
   exhibited promising potential with massive operating data from the
   supervisory control and data acquisition system. However, automatically
   extracting the complicated interactions between measurements and subtly
   integrating it with temporal evolutions have not been fully considered.
   Besides, with the increasing complexity of industrial processes,
   accurately locating fault roots is of tremendous significance. In this
   article, we propose an unsupervised spatial-temporal aware graph
   encoder-decoder (STAGED) model for industrial fault diagnosis. Firstly,
   the high-dimensional measurements are constructed as a weighted graph to
   depict the complicated interactions. Then, the graph convolutional
   network, long short-term memory network and attention mechanism are
   applied to learn a comprehensive representation for multi-series. To
   enforce the model to better capture the temporal evolution, the dual
   decoder that performs reconstruction and prediction tasks simultaneously
   is adopted with a well-designed comprehensive loss function. By learning
   the spatial-temporal evolutions of datasets, faults can be diagnosed and
   located at a fine-grained level based on reconstruction deviations. To
   verify the performance of STAGED, experiments on Cranfield three-phase
   flow facility and secure water treatment datasets are implemented and
   the results indicate that it can provide insight into fault evolution
   and accurately diagnose faults.

AB In many brain network studies, brain functional connectivity data is
   extracted from neuroimaging data and then used for disease prediction.
   For now, brain disease data not only has a small sample but also has the
   problem of high dimensional and nonlinear. Therefore, deep clustering on
   brain functional connectivity data is very challenging. To solve these
   problems, we propose a Soft-orthogonal Constrained Dual-stream Encoder
   with Self-supervised clustering network (SSCDE), which consists of a
   pretext task and downstream task, which can fully mine the effective
   information in brain disease data. In the pretext task, we use two brain
   disease data under the same category to do cross-domain learning to
   obtain effective information from the same dataset. In the downstream
   task, to reduce redundancy and avoid negative coding, we propose a
   soft-orthogonal constrained dual-stream encoder to encode features
   separately. At the same time, we use the pseudo labels given by the
   pretext task as prior information for self-supervised learning. We
   conduct validation on different brain disease recognition tasks, and the
   result have proved that the proposed framework has achieved good
   performance compared with the unsupervised clustering analysis
   algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-domain assisted
   recognition study on brain functional connectivity data. The code is
   available at https://github.com/hulu88/SSCDE.

AB Herein, we highlight the simplistic fabrication of a light-weight,
   flexible self-charging power pack by the prudent integration of two
   paper-based high-performance triboelectric nanogenerators (HPTENGs), one
   commercial semi-flexible photovoltaic/solar cell and a paper-based
   all-solid-state asymmetric-type supercapacitor (ASSASC) with optimized
   performance. Each HPTENG unit comprises of a similar to 20 wt% barium
   titanate nanoparticles loaded surface micropatterned post-polled PDMS
   composite (PDMS-20BTO) film-strip impregnated with graphite coated
   Whatman (R) 41 filter paper (GFP) as negative and a polypyrrole
   electrodeposited GFP as positive tribo-electric friction layers,
   respectively. Contrariwise, the ASSASC consists of a
   nickel-cobalt-molybdenum oxide-graphitic C3N4 hybrid composite coated
   GFP (NCMO-gCN2/GFP) as positive and a graphitic C3N4 modified reduced
   graphene oxide coated GFP (gCN-m-RGO/GFP) as negative electrodes,
   separated by a thin PVA-KOH gel-type electrolyte membrane. Finally,
   under deformations/stress and illumination of solar light individually
   on top of our photovoltaic and HPTENGs driven self-charging ASSASC
   (PTSCASC) power pack, it efficaciously generates electrical energy and
   consequently stores this generated energy as electrochemical energy for
   sus-tainable power supply. Our self-powered PTSCASC# power pack
   prototype (with two ASSASCs) has been effectually integrated with a
   medical smart patch for electric pulsatile mediated controlled drug
   release. Hence, our as-designed self-charging power pack possesses
   immense potentials for self-powered multifunctional electronics and
   smart e-healthcare monitoring systems.

AB In the recommendation system, collaborative filtering methods based on
   the graph convolution network can explicitly model the interaction
   between the nodes of the user-item bipartite graph and effectively use
   higher-order neighbor information. However, its representations are very
   susceptible to the noise of interaction. In response to this problem,
   SGL explored the self-supervised learning on the user-item graph to
   improve the robustness of GCN. Nevertheless, the contrastive learning
   framework it applied does not consider the specificity of the
   recommendation task and the uncertainty of user-item interaction
   fully.In order to solve the above problems, we propose a learning
   paradigm called supervised contrastive learning (SCL) based on the graph
   convolutional neural network. We carefully design SCL guided by the
   basic idea of the recommendation task that users with similar
   interaction histories have similar interests and preferences.
   Specifically, we will calculate the similarity between different nodes
   on the user side and the item side respectively during data
   preprocessing firstly. And then when applying contrastive learning, not
   only will the augmented samples be regarded as the positive samples, but
   also a certain number of augmented samples of similar nodes will be
   regarded as the positive samples, which is different with SGL that
   treats other samples in a batch as negative samples. SCL purposefully
   makes representations learned by similar nodes close to each other in
   the feature space. In addition, to address the uncertainty of node
   interaction, we also propose a new data augment method called node
   replication. We apply SCL on the most advanced LightGCN. Empirical
   research and ablation study on Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book
   datasets prove the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of SCL and
   node replication.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) have been developed as relevant
   analytical tools for the study of the gene expression patterns behind
   complex phenotypes. Determining the association between structure and
   function in GCNs is a current challenge in biomedical research. Several
   structural differences between GCNs of breast cancer and healthy
   phenotypes have been reported. In a previous study, using co-expression
   multilayer networks, we have shown that there are abrupt differences in
   the connectivity patterns of the GCN of basal-like breast cancer between
   top co-expressed gene-pairs and the remaining gene-pairs. Here, we
   compared the top-100,000-interactions networks for the four breast
   cancer phenotypes (Luminal-A, Luminal-B, Her2+ and Basal), in terms of
   structural properties. For this purpose, we used the graph-theoretical
   k-core of a network (maximal sub-network with nodes of degree at least
   k). We developed a comprehensive analysis of the network k-core (k = 30)
   structures in cancer, and its relationship with biological functions. We
   found that in the Top-100,000edges networks, the majority of
   interactions in breast cancer networks are intra-chromosome, meanwhile
   inter-chromosome interactions serve as connecting bridges between
   clusters. Moreover, core genes in the healthy network are strongly
   associated with processes such as metabolism and cell cycle. In breast
   cancer, only the core of Luminal A is related to those processes, and
   genes in its core are over-expressed. The intersection of the core nodes
   in all subtypes of cancer is composed only by genes in the chr8q24.3
   region. This region has been observed to be highly amplified in several
   cancers before, and its appearance in the intersection of the four
   breast cancer k-cores, may suggest that local co-expression is a
   conserved phenomenon in cancer. Considering the many intricacies
   associated with these phenomena and the vast amount of research in
   epigenomic regulation which is currently undergoing, there is a need for
   further research on the epigenomic effects on the structure and function
   of gene co-expression networks in cancer.

   using dicyandiamide and diammonium hydrogen phosphate as precursors.
   Heterojunctioned Ag/AgBr/V2O5/PCN ternary nanocomposite was fabricated

   photocatalytic efficacy as compared to bare PCN, AgBr and V2O5 (VO). The
   improved photodegradation ability of Ag/AgBr/VO/PCN nanocomposite was
   ascribed to appropriate band alignment as well as Z-scheme electron hole
   pair generation which were facilitated by good storage and transmission
   of electron through Ag among PCN, AgBr and VO and resulted reduction in

AB A major challenge concerning a mixed traffic flow system, composed of
   connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs),
   is how to improve overall efficiency and safety by assigning appropriate
   control strategies to CAVs. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a
   promising approach to address this challenge. It enables the joint
   training of multiple CAVs by fusing CAV sensing information and does not
   need compliance of HDVs. However, the fusion of CAV sensing information
   is non-trivial. Traditional DRL models usually fail to take advantage of
   connectivity among CAVs and time series characteristics of vehicle
   sensing information, leading to insufficient awareness of the traffic
   environment. Aimed at tackling these issues, this study proposes a DRL
   framework named spatiotemporal deep Q network (STDQN), by integrating a
   double deep Q network (DDQN) and a spatiotemporal information extraction
   module. A long-short term memory neural network with an attention
   mechanism (AttenLSTMNN) is leveraged to extract temporal dependencies
   from vehicle perceptive information. In addition, a graph convolution
   network (GCN) is employed to model the spatial correlations among
   vehicles in a local range, as well as the connectivity of multiple CAVs
   in a global range. Simulation experiments are conducted in an onramp
   merging scenario, which is one of the most important and commonly seen
   scenarios in highway or city expressway systems. Experimental results
   prove that as compared to baseline DRL and rule-based methods, the
   proposed STDQN can improve the overall traffic efficiency, safety, and
   driving comfort. The proposed framework is promised to be deployed into
   real CAVs, to realize cooperative, safe, and efficient autonomous
   driving.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shared-account cross-domain sequential recommendation (SCSR) task aims
   to recommend the next item via leveraging the mixed user behaviors in
   multiple domains. It is gaining immense research attention as more and
   more users tend to sign up on different platforms and share accounts
   with others to access domain-specific services. Existing works on SCSR
   mainly rely on mining sequential patterns via recurrent neural network
   (RNN)-based models, which suffer from the following limitations: 1)
   RNN-based methods overwhelmingly target discovering sequential
   dependencies in single-user behaviors and they are not expressive enough
   to capture the relationships among multiple entities in SCSR; 2) all
   existing methods bridge two domains via knowledge transfer in the latent
   space and ignore the explicit cross-domain graph structure; and 3) none
   existing studies consider the time interval information among items,
   which is essential in the sequential recommendation for characterizing
   different items and learning discriminative representations for them. In
   this work, we propose a new graph-based solution, namely, time
   interval-enhanced domain-aware graph convolutional network (TiDA-GCN),
   to address the above challenges. Specifically, we first link users and
   items in each domain as a graph. Then, we devise a domain-aware graph
   convolution network to learn user-specific node representations. To
   fully account for users' domain-specific preferences on items, two
   effective attention mechanisms are further developed to selectively
   guide the message-passing process. Moreover, to further enhance item-and
   account-level representation learning, we incorporate the time interval
   into the message passing and design an account-aware self-attention
   module for learning items' interactive characteristics. Experiments
   demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method from various aspects.

AB Nowadays, hybrid photocatalysts are gaining importance due to their
   improved photo-catalytic activity. In the present work, Ag2CO3 was
   integrated phosphorous and sulphur co-doped g-C3N4 (PSGCN) photocatalyst
   (Ag2CO3/PSGCN) to minimize the recombination of photogenerated
   electron-hole pair. The co-doping resulted in band gap lowering in GCN
   leading to more visible light activity. Successful formation of well
   dispersed Ag2CO3/PSGCN suspension in water was established by zeta
   potential and Tyndall effect experiments. Phosphorous and sulphur
   co-doping in g-C3N4 resulted lowering of optical band gap that enhanced
   its photodegradation ability under visible light. The reduction in
   photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination was confirmed by
   photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance analysis. The
   photodegradation of 2, 4, dinitrophenol (DNP) followed pseudo first
   order kinetics and enhanced photocatalytic activity was due to
   semiconductor heterojunction for effective separation of electron-hole
   pair. Holes and hydroxyl radicals were two main oxidative species
   responsible for photodegradation of DNP into nontoxic products. COD,
   HPLC and LC-MS investigations were used to investigate the degradation
   fragment during DNP mineralization. Ag2CO3/PSGCN nanocomposite revealed
   high stability and recycle efficiency substantial for ten catalytic

AB Accurate and timely traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent
   transportation systems (ITS). Recent advances in graph-based neural
   networks have achieved promising prediction results. However, some
   challenges remain, especially regarding graph construction and the time
   complexity of models. In this paper, we propose a multi-stream feature
   fusion approach to extract and integrate rich features from traffic data
   and leverage a data-driven adjacent matrix instead of the distance-based
   matrix to construct graphs. We calculate the Spearman rank correlation
   coefficient between monitor stations to obtain the initial adjacent
   matrix and fine-tune it while training. As to the model, we construct a
   multi-stream feature fusion block (MFFB) module, which includes a
   three-channel network and the soft-attention mechanism. The
   three-channel networks are graph convolutional neural network (GCN),
   gated recurrent unit (GRU) and fully connected neural network (FNN),
   which are used to extract spatial, temporal and other features,
   respectively. The soft-attention mechanism is utilized to integrate the
   obtained features. The MFFB modules are stacked, and a fully connected
   layer and a convolutional layer are used to make predictions. We conduct
   experiments on two real-world traffic prediction tasks and verify that
   our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods within an
   acceptable time complexity.

AB The current work emphasized the facile fabrication of PCN/GO
   nanocomposites via a straight forward sonochemical method. The thermal
   polycondensation method was used for the preparation of graphitic carbon
   nitride (GCN) and phosphorous doped graphitic carbon nitride (PCN)
   photocatalysts using melamine and BmimPF(6)(1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   hexafluorophosphate) precursors. Phosphorous doped g-C(3)N(4)with
   different wt % ratio of phosphorous (0.05, 0.1, and 0.3%) was
   successfully fabricated and coupled with graphitic oxide (GO) for
   malathion degradation and bacterial disinfection. Phosphorous doping
   improved the electronic and textual properties of g-C(3)N(4)and
   augmented solar light-responsive range. On the other hand,
   simultaneously, the GO support simultaneously facilitated the charge
   separation and transportation, which was validated by PL and EIS
   analysis. The extremely organized porous structure of PCN/GO nanosheets
   expanded active sites, quickened electron transmission rate, and caused
   strong adsorption of pollutants. Specific surface area (S-BET) of 0.1
   wt% PCN/GO and PCN photocatalysts was 13.6840 and 2.8401 m(2) g(-1),
   respectively. The addition of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in
   photodegradation processes augmented the photodegradation ability of
   nanocomposites due to the triggering of sulfate radical (SO4 center
   dot(-)) based advanced oxidation process. The influence of different
   reaction parameters, including a concentration of PMS, catalyst dosage,
   initial concentration of the pesticide, and pH, was also assessed in the
   photodegradation process. All the photodegradation processes followed
   the pseudo-first-order kinetics as the regression coefficient (R-2), and
   values of linear graphs were from 0.95 to 0.98. The nanocomposite 0.1
   wt% PCN/GO/PMS displayed the highest photodegradation efficiency, i.e.,
   98%, followed by 0.1 wt% PCN/GO (95%) and other photocatalysts.
   Similarly, 98%Escherichia coli(E.Coli) bacterial disinfection was
   observed for 0.1 wt% PCN/GO nanocomposite.

AB The globalization of the integrated circuit (IC) supply chain has moved
   most of the design, fabrication, and testing process from a single
   trusted entity to various untrusted third-party entities worldwide. The
   risk of using untrusted third-Party Intellectual Property (3PIP) is the
   possibility for adversaries to insert malicious modifications known as
   Hardware Trojans (HTs). These HTs can compromise the integrity,
   deteriorate the performance, deny the service, and alter the
   functionality of the design. While numerous HT detection methods have
   been proposed in the literature, the crucial task of HT localization is
   overlooked. Moreover, a few existing HT localization methods have
   several weaknesses: reliance on a golden reference, inability to
   generalize for all types of HT, lack of scalability, low localization
   resolution, and manual feature engineering/property definition. To
   overcome their shortcomings, we propose a novel, golden reference-free
   HT localization method at the pre-silicon stage by leveraging graph
   convolutional network (GCN). In this work, we convert the circuit design
   into its intrinsic data structure, graph, and extract the node
   attributes. Afterward, the graph convolution performs automatic feature
   extraction for nodes to classify the nodes as Trojan or benign. Our
   approach is automated and does not burden the designer with manual code
   review. It locates the Trojan signals with 99.6% accuracy, 93.1%
   F1-score, and a false-positive rate below 0.009%.

AB The video captioning task aims to describe video content using several
   natural-language sentences. Although one-step encoder-decoder models
   have achieved promising progress, the generations always involve many
   errors, which are mainly caused by the large semantic gap between the
   visual domain and the language domain and by the difficulty in
   long-sequence generation. The underlying challenge of video captioning,
   i.e., sequence-to-sequence mapping across different domains, is still
   not well handled. Inspired by the proofreading procedure of human
   beings, the generated caption can be gradually polished to improve its
   quality. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement polishing
   network (DRPN) to refine the caption candidates, which consists of a
   word-denoising network (WDN) to revise word errors and a
   grammar-checking network (GCN) to revise grammar errors. On the one
   hand, the long-term reward in deep reinforcement learning benefits the
   long-sequence generation, which takes the global quality of caption
   sentences into account. On the other hand, the caption candidate can be
   considered a bridge between visual and language domains, where the
   semantic gap is gradually reduced with better candidates generated by
   repeated revisions. In experiments, we present adequate evaluations to
   show that the proposed DRPN achieves comparable and even better
   performance than the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the DRPN is
   model-irrelevant and can be integrated into any video captioning models
   to refine their generated caption sentences.

AB Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a widely cultivated fruit crop whose
   growth and productivity are greatly affected by low temperatures. On the
   other hand, wild Vitis species represent valuable genetic resources of
   natural stress tolerance. We have isolated and characterized a MYB-like
   gene encoding a putative GARP-type transcription factor from Amur grape
   (V. amurensis) designated as VaAQUILO. AQUILO (AQ) is induced by cold in
   both V. amurensis and V. vinifera, and its overexpression results in
   significantly improved tolerance to cold both in transgenic Arabidopsis
   and in Amur grape calli. In Arabidopsis, the ectopic expression of VaAQ
   increased antioxidant enzyme activities and up-regulated reactive oxygen
   species-(ROS) scavenging-related genes. Comparative mRNA sequencing
   profiling of 35S: VaAQ Arabidopsis plants suggests that this
   transcription factor is related to phosphate homeostasis like their
   Arabidopsis closest homologues: AtHRS1 and AtHHO2. However, when a cold
   stress is imposed, AQ is tightly associated with the cold-responsive
   pathway and with the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), as
   observed by the up-regulation of galactinol synthase (GoLS) and
   raffinose synthase genes. Gene co-expression network (GCN) and
   cis-regulatory element (CRE) analyses in grapevine indicated AQ as
   potentially regulating VvGoLS genes. Increased RFO content was confirmed
   in both transgenic Arabidopsis and Amur grape calli overexpressing VaAQ.
   Taken together, our results imply that AQ improves cold tolerance
   through promoting the accumulation of osmoprotectants.

AB Pixels of clouds and cloud shadows in a remote sensing image impact
   image quality, image interpretation, and subsequent applications. In
   this paper, we propose a novel cloud removal method based on deep
   learning that automatically reconstructs the invalid pixels with the
   auxiliary information from multi-temporal images. Our method's
   innovation lies in its feature extraction and loss functions, which
   reside in a novel gated convolutional network (GCN) instead of a series
   of common convolutions. It takes the current cloudy image, a recent
   cloudless image, and the mask of clouds as input, without any
   requirements of external training samples, to realize a self-training
   process with clean pixels in the bi-temporal images as natural training
   samples. In our feature extraction, gated convolutional layers, for the
   first time, are introduced to discriminate cloudy pixels from clean
   pixels, which make up for a common convolution layer's lack of the
   ability to discriminate. Our multi-level constrained joint loss
   function, which consists of an image-level loss, a feature-level loss,
   and a total variation loss, can achieve local and global consistency
   both in shallow and deep levels of features. The total variation loss is
   introduced into the deep-learning-based cloud removal task for the first
   time to eliminate the color and texture discontinuity around cloud
   outlines needing repair. On the WHU cloud dataset with diverse land
   cover scenes and different imaging conditions, our experimental results
   demonstrated that our method consistently reconstructed the cloud and
   cloud shadow pixels in various remote sensing images and outperformed
   several mainstream deep-learning-based methods and a conventional method
   for every indicator by a large margin.

AB With the rapid development of high-tech multimedia technologies, many
   musical resource assets are available online and it has always triggered
   an interest in the classification of different music genres. Detecting a
   set of music belonging to a similar genre is the main intention of the
   music recommendation playlist. With the help of machine learning,
   transfer learning and deep learning concepts, a robust music classifier
   is necessary so that the unlabelled music can be easily tagged and
   thereby the users experience of using media players with music files can
   be improved. The existing approaches in the past decade has various
   shortcomings due to the manual extraction of features followed by
   traditional machine learning classification techniques affecting the
   classification accuracy to a great extent along with its drawback to not
   perform well on multiclass classification problems and its inability to
   deal with huge data size. In this work, five interesting and novel
   approaches are proposed for music genre classification such as the
   proposed Weighted Visibility Graph based Elastic Net Sparse Classifier
   (WVG-ELNSC), the proposed classification using sequential machine
   learning analysis with Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) classifier,
   the proposed Riemannian Alliance based Tangent Space Mapping (RA-TSM)
   transfer learning techniques, classification using Transfer Support
   Vector Machine (TSVM) algorithm, and finally the proposed deep learning
   classifier with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) cum
   Attention model with Graphical Convolution Network (GCN) termed as BAG
   deep learning model is used here. The experiments are done for three
   music datasets such as GTZAN, ISMIR 2004 and MagnaTagATune datasets and
   a relatively higher classification accuracy of 93.51% is obtained when
   the proposed deep learning BAG model is utilized.

AB This paper addresses video highlight detection which aims to select a
   small subset of frames according to user's major or special interest.
   The performances of conventional methods highly depend on large-scale
   manually labeled training data which are time-consuming and
   labor-intensive to collect. To deal with this problem, we trace back to
   the original problem definition and find that whether a user is
   interested in a specific video segment heavily depends on human's
   subjective emotions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an emotion
   knowledge driven video detection framework for modeling human's general
   emotion and inferencing highlight strength. Firstly, we obtain the
   concept-level representation of the video clip with a front-end network.
   The concepts are used as nodes to build an emotion-related knowledge
   graph, and their relationships in the graph are modeled via external
   public knowledge graphs. Then we adopt Siamese GCNs to model the
   dependencies between nodes in the graph and propagate messages along the
   edges. Finally, we compute the emotion-aware representation of the video
   clip based on the GCN layers and further use it to predict the highlight
   score. Our framework, including the front-end network, graph convolution
   layers and the highlight mapping network, can be trained in an
   end-to-end manner with the constraint of a ranking loss. Experiments on
   two benchmark datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably
   against the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Typhoons are some of the most serious natural disasters, and the key to
   disaster prevention and mitigation is typhoon level classification. How
   to better use data of satellite cloud pictures to achieve accurate
   classification of typhoon levels has become one of classification the
   hot issues in current studies. A new framework of deep learning neural
   network, Graph Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory Network (GC-LSTM),
   is proposed, which is based on the data of satellite cloud pictures of
   the Himawari-8 satellite in 2010-2019. The Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) is used to process the irregular spatial structure of satellite
   cloud pictures effectively, and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   network is utilized to learn the characteristics of satellite cloud
   pictures over time. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness and accuracy
   of the model, the prediction effect and model stability are compared
   with other models. The results show that: the algorithm performance of
   this model is better than other prediction models; the prediction
   accuracy rate of typhoon level classification reaches 92.35%, and the
   prediction accuracy of typhoons and super typhoons reaches 95.12%. The
   model can accurately identify typhoon eye and spiral cloud belt, and the
   prediction results are always kept in the minimum range compared with
   the actual results, which proves that the GC-LSTM model has stronger
   stability. The model can accurately identify the levels of different
   typhoons according to the satellite cloud pictures. In summary, the
   results can provide a theoretical basis for the related research of
   typhoon level classification.

AB With the development of data plane programmable Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on the
   data plane increasingly become fatal. Currently, traditional attack
   detection methods are mainly used to detect whether a DDoS attack occurs
   and it is difficult to find the path that the attack flow traverses the
   network, which makes it difficult to accurately mitigate DDoS attacks.
   In this article, we propose a detection method based on Spatial-Temporal
   Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) over the data plane programmable
   SDN, which maps the network into a graph. It senses the state of
   switches through In-band Network Telemetry (INT) with sampling, inputs
   the network state into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network
   detection model, and finally finds out the switches through which DDoS
   attack flows pass. Based on this, we propose a defense method combined
   with an enhanced whitelist and a precise dropping strategy, which can
   effectively mitigate DDoS attacks and minimize the impact on legitimate
   network traffic. The evaluation results show that our detection method
   can accurately detect the path that the DDoS attack flows pass through,
   and can effectively mitigate the DDoS attack. Compared to classic
   methods, our method improves the detection accuracy by nearly 10%. At
   the same time, the southbound interface load and CPU overhead brought by
   our detection and defense process are much lower than the classic
   methods.

AB Most publicly available datasets for image classification are with
   single labels, while images are inherently multilabeled in our daily
   life. Such an annotation gap makes many pretrained single-label
   classification models fail in practical scenarios. For aerial images,
   this annotation issue is more concerned: Aerial data naturally cover a
   relatively large land area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial
   datasets currently publicly available (e.g., UCM and AID) are
   single-labeled. As manually annotating multilabel aerial images (MAIs)
   would be time-/ labor-consuming, we propose a novel self-correction
   integrated domain adaptation (SCIDA) method for automatic multilabel
   learning. SCIDA is weakly supervised, i.e., automatically learning the
   multilabel image classification model from using massive, publicly
   available single-label images. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel
   labelwise self-correction (LWC) module to better explore underlying
   label correlations. This module also makes the unsupervised domain
   adaptation (UDA) from single-label to multilabel data possible. For
   model training, the proposed method uses single-label information yet
   requires no prior knowledge of multilabeled data and predicts labels for
   MAIs. Through extensive evaluations, the proposed model, which is
   trained with single-labeled MAI-AID-s and MAI-UCM-s datasets, achieves
   much better performances than comparative methods on our collected
   multiscene aerial image dataset. The code and data are available on
   GitHub (https://github.com/Ryan315/Single2multi-DA).

AB A deep understanding of our visual world is more than an isolated
   perception on a series of objects, and the relationships between them
   also contain rich semantic information. Especially for those satellite
   remote sensing images, the span is so large that the various objects are
   always of different sizes and complex spatial compositions. Therefore,
   the recognition of semantic relations is conducive to strengthen the
   understanding of remote sensing scenes. In this paper, we propose a
   novel multi-scale semantic fusion network (MSFN). In this framework,
   dilated convolution is introduced into a graph convolutional network
   (GCN) based on an attentional mechanism to fuse and refine multi-scale
   semantic context, which is crucial to strengthen the cognitive ability
   of our model Besides, based on the mapping between visual features and
   semantic embeddings, we design a sparse relationship extraction module
   to remove meaningless connections among entities and improve the
   efficiency of scene graph generation. Meanwhile, to further promote the
   research of scene understanding in remote sensing field, this paper also
   proposes a remote sensing scene graph dataset (RSSGD). We carry out
   extensive experiments and the results show that our model significantly
   outperforms previous methods on scene graph generation. In addition,
   RSSGD effectively bridges the huge semantic gap between low-level
   perception and high-level cognition of remote sensing images.

AB Spleen volume estimation using automated image segmentation technique
   may be used to detect splenomegaly (abnormally enlarged spleen) on
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. In recent years, Deep
   Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) segmentation methods have
   demonstrated advantages for abdominal organ segmentation. However,
   variations in both size and shape of the spleen on MRI images may result
   in large false positive and false negative labeling when deploying DCNN
   based methods. In this paper, we propose the Splenomegaly Segmentation
   Network (SSNet) to address spatial variations when segmenting
   extraordinarily large spleens. SSNet was designed based on the framework
   of image-to-image conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN).
   Specifically, the Global Convolutional Network (GCN) was used as the
   generator to reduce false negatives, while the Markovian discriminator
   (PatchGAN) was used to alleviate false positives. A cohort of clinically
   acquired 3D MRI scans (both T1 weighted and T2 weighted) from patients
   with splenomegaly were used to train and test the networks. The
   experimental results demonstrated that a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9260
   and a median Dice coefficient of 0.9262 using SSNet on independently
   tested MRI volumes of patients with splenomegaly.

AB Events are happening in real world and real time, which can be planned
   and organized for occasions, such as social gatherings, festival
   celebrations, influential meetings, or sports activities. Social media
   platforms generate a lot of real-time text information regarding public
   events with different topics. However, mining social events is
   challenging because events typically exhibit heterogeneous texture and
   metadata are often ambiguous. In this article, we first design a novel
   event-based meta-schema to characterize the semantic relatedness of
   social events and then build an event-based heterogeneous information
   network (HIN) integrating information from external knowledge base.
   Second, we propose a novel Pairwise Popularity Graph Convolutional
   Network, named as PP-GCN, based on weighted meta-path instance
   similarity and textual semantic representation as inputs, to perform
   fine-grained social event categorization and learn the optimal weights
   of meta-paths in different tasks. Third, we propose a streaming social
   event detection and evolution discovery framework for HINs based on
   meta-path similarity search, historical information about meta-paths,
   and heterogeneous DBSCAN clustering method. Comprehensive experiments on
   real-world streaming social text data are conducted to compare various
   social event detection and evolution discovery algorithms. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms other
   alternative social event detection and evolution discovery techniques.

AB Origin-Destination (OD) prediction which aims to predict the number of
   passenger's travel demands from one region to another, is critically
   important to many real applications including intelligent transportation
   systems and public safety. The challenges of this problem lie in both
   the dynamic patterns of the human mobility data and data sparsity in
   issue in some regions. Thus it is difficult to model the complex
   spatio-temporal correlations of the human mobility data to predict the
   OD of their trips. Meanwhile, the crowd flows in different regions of a
   city and the context features (e.g. holiday, weather and POIs) are
   potentially useful to alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve the
   OD prediction, but are largely ignored by existing works. In this paper,
   we propose a deep spatio-temporal framework which named Auxiliary-tasks
   Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Network (AEST) to more effectively address the
   OD prediction problem. AEST trains a model to conduct OD inference via
   learning crowd flow and external data as auxiliary task. The novel
   Hierarchical Convolutional LSTM (HC-LSTM) Network is proposed which
   combines CNN, GCN and LSTM to effectively capture spatiao-temporal
   correlations. In addition, we design a Contextual Network (ContextNet)
   which learns representations of contextual information to assist OD
   prediction. We conduct extensive experiments over bike and taxicab trip
   datasets in New York. The results show that our method is superior to
   the state-of-art approaches.

AB A simple and effective photoelectrochemical sensor was fabricated by
   Cu/graphitic carbon nitride (Cu/gCN) composites for detecting bisphenol
   A. The Cu/g-CN composites were obtained via a solvothermal process in
   the presence of the copper-based ionic liquid. In view of localized
   surface plasmon resonance of Cu nanoparticles, Cu nanoparticles can
   promote light absorbance and rapid electron transport of g-CN. As a
   result, the Cu/g-CN composites obtained greatly enhancement of
   photocurrent, when compared to the pure g-CN. In addition, the
   introduction of bisphenol A can hinder electron-hole recombination,
   resulting in sensitive photoelectrochemical monitoring of bisphenol A.
   The detection limit of the bisphenol A photoelectrochemical sensor was
   below 0.012 mu mol/L. The bisphenol A photoelectrochemical sensor
   exhibited an excellent stability and acceptable anti-interference. The
   photoelectrochemical sensor provided the promising platform to monitor
   bisphenol A at low concentration in water environment. (C) 2018 Chinese

AB With accumulating dysregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) in pathological
   processes, the regulatory functions of circRNAs, especially circRNAs as
   microRNA (miRNA) sponges and their interactions with RNA-binding
   proteins (RBPs), have been widely validated. However, the collected
   information on experimentally validated circRNA-disease associations is
   only preliminary. Therefore, an updated CircR2Disease database providing
   a comprehensive resource and web tool to clarify the relationships
   between circRNAs and diseases in diverse species is necessary. Here, we
   present an updated CircR2Disease v2.0 with the increased number of
   circRNA-disease associations and novel characteristics. CircR2Disease
   v2.0 provides more than 5-fold experimentally validated circRNA-disease
   associations compared to its previous version. This version includes
   4201 entries between 3077 circRNAs and 312 disease subtypes. Secondly,
   the information of circRNA-miRNA, circRNA-miRNA-target, and circRNA-RBP
   interactions has been manually collected for various diseases. Thirdly,
   the gene symbols of circRNAs and disease name IDs can be linked with
   various nomenclature databases. Detailed descriptions such as samples
   and journals have also been integrated into the updated version. Thus,
   CircR2Disease v2.0 can serve as a platform for users to systematically
   investigate the roles of dysregulated circRNAs in various diseases and
   further explore the posttranscriptional regulatory function in diseases.
   Finally, we propose a computational method named circDis based on the
   graph convolutional network (GCN) and gradient boosting decision tree
   (GBDT) to illustrate the applications of the CircR2Disease v2.0
   database. CircR2Disease v2.0 is available at

AB The histone acetyl transferase (HAT) are involved in acetylation of
   histones that lead to transcription activation in numerous gene
   regulatory mechanisms. There are very few GCN5 HAT inhibitors reported
   despite of their role in cancer progression. In this study, we have
   utilized in-silico virtual screening approaches based on various machine
   learning algorithm to identify potent inhibitors of GCN5 HAT from
   commercially available Maybridge library. We have generated predictive
   chemoinformatics models based on k-Nearest neighbour, naive Bayesian,
   Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. Based on statistical
   parameters, the RF and SVM models have shown comparative performance.
   Therefore, we performed the virtual screening with these two models and
   the consensus hits were selected for further evaluation using molecular
   docking into the active site of GCN-5 HAT. Finally, a set of 10
   molecules were selected and subjected to biological evaluation.
   Subsequently, inhibition of acetylation shown by three out of the ten
   molecules in the in-vitro experiments validated their utility as
   potential HAT inhibitors. Furthermore, the selected hits have also shown
   weak cell growth decrease in MCF-7 cancer cell lines, which suggests
   that after subsequent structural optimization the identified molecules
   may further be explored for the development of anti-cancer agents.

AB It is always a hot issue in the intelligence analysis field to predict
   the trend of news description by pre-trained language models and graph
   neural networks. However, there are several problems in the existing
   research: (1) there are few Chinese data sets on this subject in
   academia and industry; and (2) using the existing pre-trained language
   models and graph classification algorithms cannot achieve satisfactory
   results. The method described in this paper can better solve these
   problems. (1) We built a Chinese news database predicted by more than
   9000 annotated news time trends, filling the gaps in this database. (2)
   We designed an improved method based on the pre-trained language model
   and graph neural networks pooling algorithm. In the graph pooling
   algorithm, the Graph U-Nets Pooling method and self-attention are
   combined, which can better solve the analysis of the problem of
   forecasting the development trend of news events. The experimental
   results show that the effect of this method compared with the baseline
   graph classification algorithm is improved, and it also solves the
   shortcomings of the pre-trained language model that cannot handle very
   long texts. Therefore, it can be concluded that our research has strong
   processing capabilities for analyzing and predicting the development
   trend of Chinese news events.

AB As a vital research subject in the field of intelligent transportation
   systems (ITSs), traffic flow prediction using deep learning methods has
   attracted much attention in recent years. However, numerous existing
   studies mainly focus on short-term traffic flow predictions and fail to
   consider the influence of external factors. Effective long-term traffic
   flow prediction has become a challenging issue. As a solution to these
   challenges, this paper proposes a deep learning approach based on a
   spatiotemporal graph convolutional network for long-term traffic flow
   prediction with multiple factors. In the proposed method, our innovative
   idea is to introduce an attribute feature unit (AF-unit) to fuse
   external factors into a spatiotemporal graph convolutional network. The
   proposed method consists of (1) constructing a weighted adjacency matrix
   using Gaussian similarity functions; (2) assembling a feature matrix to
   store time-series traffic flow; (3) building an external attribute
   matrix composed of external factors, including temperature, visibility,
   and weather conditions; and (4) building a spatiotemporal graph
   convolutional network based on a deep learning architecture (i.e.,
   T-GCN). The experimental results indicate that (1) the performance of
   our method considering spatiotemporal dependence has better prediction
   capability than baseline models; (2) the fusion of meteorological
   factors can reduce the inaccuracy of traffic prediction; and (3) our
   method has high accuracy and stability in long-term traffic flow
   prediction.

AB Traffic flow prediction is the key problem of intelligent transportation
   system. Accurate prediction results are indispensable for traffic
   management and road planning. However, due to the complex
   spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow data, including the spatial
   correlation and temporal correlation of adjacency, periodicity, and
   trend that exist between different roads. The existing forecasting
   methods consider the spatial-temporal correlation but lack the dynamic
   modeling of spatial-temporal correlation. To deal with this dynamic
   feature, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional attention-based
   spatial-temporal network (MA-STN). It mainly contains three parts, the
   spatial-temporal attention unit, the spatial-temporal feature extraction
   unit based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the fusion
   prediction unit, and the residual connection is also added to the model
   to avoid the gradient disappearance problem. Meanwhile, this paper
   divides the dataset into three subsets to deal with the three features
   in the temporal dimension separately. To verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed model, two real-world road traffic flow data collected by PeMS
   system are used for validation. By comparing six different models, the
   proposed network in this paper has a 7% accuracy improvement compared to
   the baseline model. To verify the effectiveness of the attention
   mechanism, ablation experiments are used in this paper for validation,
   and the results show that the attention mechanism can achieve a 5%
   accuracy improvement.

AB General-purpose embeddings do not guarantee to produce the best
   representation for the target tasks. In the graph domain, random
   walk-based graph embedding methods like DeepWalk and Node2Vec are widely
   used methods that generate general-purpose embedding. These methods,
   however, can not achieve high accuracy in different tasks, including
   node classification. In contrast, semi-supervised methods such as Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), and their
   extensions achieve state-of-the-art performance in this task as they use
   few labels for learning the most appropriate embedding. These methods,
   however, depend on node features and cannot achieve high performance in
   the absence of node features or low dimension features. In this paper,
   we propose GuidedWalk, a semi-supervised random walk-based graph
   embedding method that can outperform other random walk-based competitors
   as well as GNNs in the semi-supervised setting on graphs without node
   features. The proposed model works based on exploring graph paths with
   more emphasis on the paths that connect nodes of the same class. We show
   that the neural processing core of DeepWalk and Node2Vec propagates
   latent features across sampled paths. Therefore, our selected paths
   increase the chances of propagating the right latent features, which is
   appropriate for the node classification task. Our experiments on Cora,
   Pubmed, Twitch DE, and Facebook datasets, show 0.53%, 0.78%, 5.07%, and
   7.13% improvement in node classification accuracy compared to the
   state-of-the-art techniques in the field.

AB Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearing is essential to
   guarantee its safe operation. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based
   methods attract a lot of research attention for accurate RUL prediction.
   However, the weak interpretability of the DL models prevents their wide
   use in practical systems. In this article, the graph is used to
   represent the degradation state of bearings, and a graph neural network
   (GNN) is applied for their RUL prediction. Specifically, regression
   shapelet is proposed to transform the bearings time series data into
   graph structure first. Then, with the proposed distance matrix/adjacency
   matrix as the input and smoothed nonlinear health index (SNHI) as the
   output, a deep GNN model combining graph convolutional neural network
   (GCN) and gate recurrent unit (GRU) is set up in both spatial and
   temporal perspectives to predict the bearing RUL. Meanwhile, graph
   evolution is adopted to monitor the graph changes with time and offer an
   explanation for the bearing degradation procedure. The experiment study
   on the PRONOSTIA platform is used to evaluate the proposed method. The
   results show that the proposed method can well explain the bearing
   degradation process from the graph perspective and will achieve superior
   performance to the existing methods.

AB As an important field of computer vision, object detection has been
   studied extensively in recent years. However, existing object detection
   methods merely utilize the visual information of the image and fail to
   mine the high-level semantic information of the object, which leads to
   great limitations. To take full advantage of multi-source information, a
   knowledge update-based multimodal object recognition model is proposed
   in this paper. Specifically, our method initially uses Faster R-CNN to
   regionalize the image, then applies a transformer-based multimodal
   encoder to encode visual region features (region-based image features)
   and textual features (semantic relationships between words)
   corresponding to pictures. After that, a graph convolutional network
   (GCN) inference module is introduced to establish a relational network
   in which the points denote visual and textual region features, and the
   edges represent their relationships. In addition, based on an external
   knowledge base, our method further enhances the region-based
   relationship expression capability through a knowledge update module. In
   summary, the proposed algorithm not only learns the accurate
   relationship between objects in different regions of the image, but also
   benefits from the knowledge update through an external relational
   database. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   knowledge update module and the independent reasoning ability of our
   model.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has attracted much attention in
   the field of remote sensing. However, the lack of sufficient labeled
   training samples is a huge challenge for HSI classification. To face
   this challenge, we propose a semisupervised HSI classification method
   based on graph convolutional broad network (GCBN). First, to avoid the
   underfitting problem caused by the insufficient linear sparse feature
   representation ability of broad learning system (BLS), graph convolution
   operation is applied to extract nonlinear and discriminative
   spectral-spatial features from the original HSI to replace the linear
   mapping features in the traditional BLS. Second, to solve the problem of
   insufficient model classification ability caused by limited labeled
   samples, the combinatorial average method (CAM) is proposed to use
   valuable paired samples to generate sample expansion set for GCBN model
   training. Third, BLS is used to perform broad expansion on
   spectral-spatial features extracted by GCN and extended by CAM, which
   further enhances the feature representation ability. Finally, the output
   weights can be easily calculated by the ridge regression theory.
   Experimental results on three real HSI datasets demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our proposed GCBN.

AB In the skeleton-based human action recognition domain, the
   spatial-temporal graph convolution networks (ST-GCNs) have made great
   progress recently. However, they use only one fixed temporal convolution
   kernel, which is not enough to extract the temporal cues
   comprehensively. Moreover, simply connecting the spatial graph
   convolution layer (GCL) and the temporal GCL in series is not the
   optimal solution. To this end, we propose a novel enhanced spatial and
   extended temporal graph convolutional network (EE-GCN) in this paper.
   Three convolution kernels with different sizes are chosen to extract the
   discriminative temporal features from shorter to longer terms. The
   corresponding GCLs are then concatenated by a powerful yet efficient
   one-shot aggregation (OSA) + effective squeeze-excitation (eSE)
   structure. The OSA module aggregates the features from each layer once
   to the output, and the eSE module explores the interdependency between
   the channels of the output. Besides, we propose a new connection
   paradigm to enhance the spatial features, which expand the serial
   connection to a combination of serial and parallel connections by adding
   a spatial GCL in parallel with the temporal GCLs. The proposed method is
   evaluated on three large scale datasets, and the experimental results
   show that the performance of our method exceeds previous
   state-of-the-art methods.

AB The increasing use of distributed generation (DG) in power systems can
   result in frequent online voltage problems. In scenarios in which
   substantial DG prediction errors occur because of high DG accommodation
   levels, traditional technical solutions cannot meet the online voltage
   regulation requirements. Hence, new resources for online voltage
   regulation are needed. Here, flexible network reconfiguration is
   proposed to coordinate with the existing resources for severe online
   voltage deviations. For online topology-based voltage regulation (OTVR),
   the authors develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based
   on the following specially designed modelling to enhance the
   computational performance. The mechanism of action incorporates the
   concepts of local research, branch exchange, and action separation, and
   it effectively simplifies the action dimension and action space. In
   addition, for the graph data in OTVR, a graph convolution network (GCN)
   is applied to obtain better feature extraction. Case studies performed
   on IEEE 14-bus, 33-bus, 141-bus systems and a practical system verify
   that our proposed algorithm can obtain close to optimal solutions in 2 s
   which can meet the needs of online voltage regulation. Moreover, we
   verify that the developed OTVR effectively increases DG penetration and
   decreases the need for investment in additional regulating devices.

AB Texture characterization from the metrological point of view is
   addressed in order to establish a physically relevant and directly
   interpretable feature. In this regard, a generic formulation is proposed
   to simultaneously capture the spectral and spatial complexity in
   hyperspectral images. The feature, named relative spectral difference
   occurrence matrix (RSDOM) is thus constructed in a multireference,
   multidirectional, and multiscale context. As validation, its performance
   is assessed in three versatile tasks. In texture classification on
   HyTexiLa, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) on ICONES-HSI, and land
   cover classification on Salinas, RSDOM registers 98.5% accuracy, 80.3%
   precision (for the top 10 retrieved images), and 96.0% accuracy (after
   post-processing) respectively, outcompeting GLCM, Gabor filter, LBP,
   SVM, CCF, CNN, and GCN. Analysis shows the advantage of RSDOM in terms
   of feature size (a mere 126, 30, and 20 scalars using GMM in order of
   the three tasks) as well as metrological validity in texture
   representation regardless of the spectral range, resolution, and number

AB Graph deep learning (DL)-based prognostic methods have been successfully
   applied in bearing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, as graph
   represents spatial and temporal dependencies of signals. However, graph
   data-driven prediction methods using single-sensor data are still
   insufficiently studied, and the graph construction is not interpretable,
   where the physical meaning of edges is unclear. To overcome these
   limitations, a node-level PathGraph-based bearing RUL prediction method
   is proposed, where a Chebyshev graph convolutional network (ChebCGN)
   with bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is designed.
   The node-level PathGraph is constructed to represent the relationships
   among the time-discrete signals, where edges denote the chronological
   order and nodes represent the signals. After that, graph feature
   learning ability of ChebGCN-LSTM is enhanced by inputting different
   chronological PathGraphs related to bearings' states. In ChebGCN-LSTM,
   the BiLSTM captures the temporal information, overcoming the limitation
   of ChebGCN that ignored global temporal dependencies of signals. The
   constructed PathGraphs are input to ChebGCN-LSTM simultaneously to
   realize RUL prediction. Experimental results on case studies verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed bearing RUL prediction method.

AB Traffic accident prediction on road levels and minute levels plays an
   important role in optimizing public safety and improving traffic
   infrastructure. However, there are still some challenges in this work.
   Firstly, the dynamic factors (e.g. traffic flow) affecting traffic
   accidents make the road network have dynamic spatio-temporal dependency,
   which leads to biased prediction results. Secondly, the occurrence of
   traffic accidents is a small probability event, which brings about
   zero-inflation problem. To address aforementioned problems, the authors
   propose a Multi-Attention Dynamic Graph Convolution Network with Cost
   Sensitive Learning approach (MADGCN). Specifically, in the spatial
   dimension, MADGCN calculates the attention scores of different types of
   dynamic factors through attention mechanism to simulate the different
   influence degrees of different factors, and models dynamic inter-road
   spatial correlation through Graph Convolution Network (GCN). In the
   temporal aspect, MADGCN adaptively models the dynamic temporal
   correlations through self-attention blocks. In addition, MADGCN improves
   the loss function based on cost-sensitive learning strategy to increase
   the cost of false classification of positive samples, so as to
   accurately mine sparse positive samples. Experimental results on two
   real-world traffic accident datasets demonstrate the superiority of
   MADGCN. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, F1-score of
   MADGCN on two real-world traffic accident datasets is improved by 11.61%
   and 9.15%, respectively.

AB In skeleton-based human action recognition domain, the methods based on
   graph convolution networks have great success recently. However, most
   graphical neural networks consider the skeleton as a spatiotemporally
   uncorrelated graph and rely on a predetermined adjacency matrix,
   ignoring the spatiotemporal relevance of human actions and taking up
   significant computational costs. Meanwhile, the methods use graph
   convolution to focus too much on the neighboring nodes of the joints and
   ignore the totality of the action. In this work, we propose a
   lightweight but efficient neural network called NLB-ACSE based on the
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Our model consists of two large
   branches: non-local block branch that focuses on the long distance
   features and adaptive cross-spacetime edge branch that focuses on the
   short distance features. Both branches extract information across time
   and space, and focus on long and short information. Some simple but
   effective strategies also are applied to our model, such as semantics,
   maxpooling, and fusion inputs, which have small parameter burden but
   obtain a higher accuracy on ablation study. The proposed method with an
   order of magnitude smaller size than most previous papers is evaluated
   on three large datasets, NTU60, NTU120, and Northwesten-UCLA. The
   experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art
   performance.

AB Solar irradiance forecasting is fundamental and essential for
   commercializing solar energy generation by overcoming output
   variability. Accurate forecasting depends on historical solar irradiance
   data, correlations between various meteorological variables (e.g., wind
   speed, humidity, and cloudiness), and influences between the weather
   contexts of spatially adjacent regions. However, existing studies have
   been limited to spatiotemporal analysis of a few variables, which have
   clear correlations with solar irradiance (e.g., sunshine duration), and
   do not attempt to establish atmospheric contextual information from a
   variety of meteorological variables. Therefore, this study proposes a
   novel solar irradiance forecasting model that represents atmospheric
   parameters observed from multiple stations as an attributed dynamic
   network and analyzes temporal changes in the network by extending
   existing spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) models. By
   comparing the proposed model with existing models, we also investigated
   the contributions of (i) the spatial adjacency of the stations, (ii)
   temporal changes in the meteorological variables, and (iii) the variety
   of variables to the forecasting performance. We evaluated the
   performance of the proposed and existing models by predicting the hourly
   solar irradiance at observation stations in the Korean Peninsula. The
   experimental results showed that the three features are synergistic and
   have correlations that are difficult to establish using single-aspect
   analysis.

AB Most stock price predictive models merely rely on the target stock's
   historical informa-tion to forecast future prices, where the linkage
   effects between stocks are neglected. However, a group of prior studies
   has shown that the leverage of correlations between stocks could
   significantly improve the predictions. This article proposes a unified
   time-series relational multi-factor model (TRMF), which composes a
   self-generating relations (SGR) algorithm that can extract relational
   features automatically. In addition, the TRMF model integrates stock
   relations with other multiple dimensional features for the price
   prediction compared to extant works. Experimental validations are
   performed on the NYSE and NASDAQ data, where the model is compared with
   the popular methods such as attention Long Short-Term Memory network
   (Attn-LSTM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and multi-factor framework
   (MF). Results show that compared with these extant methods, our model
   has a higher expected cumulative return rate and a lower risk of return
   volatility.

AB Multi-label semantic decoding is a challenging task with great
   scientific significance and application value. The existing methods
   mainly focus on label learning and ignore the amount of information
   contained in the sample itself, especially non-image sample, which may
   limit their performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel
   semi-supervised modality assistance co-training network, which utilizes
   image modality to assist non-image modality for multi-label learning. In
   real application, there are two thorny issues: (i) non-image modality
   tends to be missing owing to the difficulty in obtaining them; (ii)
   although the image modality is easy to obtain from the Internet, image
   label annotation is still time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, the
   proposed method utilizes a small number of paired & labeled images and
   non-image modalities, and a large number of unpaired & unlabeled images
   from web sources to improve results. It consists of the
   modality-specific feature generators, the feature translators and the
   label relationship network. Specifically, the modality-specific feature
   generators are used to generate different features (views) for each
   modality. Semantic translators are employed to capture the relationship
   between the paired modalities and impute the missing modality feature by
   using unpaired & unlabeled images. Label relation network is a graph
   convolution network (GCN) aiming to capture the correlation between
   labels. To mine the information in unlabeled features, the co-training
   mechanism is considered. With this mechanism, we introduce a multi-view
   orthogonality constraint and a multi-label co-regularization constraint.
   Extensive experiments on three computer vision and neuroscience datasets
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB A novel smart metering technique capable of anomaly detection was
   proposed for real-time home power management system. Smart meter data
   generated in real-time were obtained from 900 households of single
   apartments. To detect outliers and missing values in smart meter data, a
   deep learning model, the autoencoder, consisting of a graph
   convolutional network and bidirectional long short-term memory network,
   was applied to the smart metering technique. Power management based on
   the smart metering technique was executed by multi-objective
   optimization in the presence of a battery storage system and an electric
   vehicle. The results of the power management employing the proposed
   smart metering technique indicate a reduction in electricity cost and
   amount of power supplied by the grid compared to the results of power
   management without anomaly detection.

AB STUDY QUESTION Is there an association between low-to-moderate levels of
   prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and children's facial shape? SUMMARY
   ANSWER PAE before and during pregnancy, even at low level (<12 g of
   alcohol per week), was found associated with the facial shape of
   children, and these associations were found attenuated as children grow
   older. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY High levels of PAE during pregnancy can
   have significant adverse associations with a child's health development
   resulting in recognizably abnormal facial development. STUDY DESIGN,
   SIZE, DURATION This study was based on the Generation R Study, a
   prospective cohort from fetal life onwards with maternal and offspring
   data. We analyzed children 3-dimensional (3D) facial images taken at
   ages 9 (n = 3149) and 13 years (n = 2477) together with the data of
   maternal alcohol consumption. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
   We defined six levels of PAE based on the frequency and dose of alcohol
   consumption and defined three tiers based on the timing of alcohol
   exposure of the unborn child. For the image analysis, we used 3D graph
   convolutional networks for non-linear dimensionality reduction, which
   compressed the high-dimensional images into 200 traits representing
   facial morphology. These 200 traits were used for statistical analysis
   to search for associations with PAE. Finally, we generated heatmaps to
   display the facial phenotypes associated with PAE. MAIN RESULTS AND THE
   ROLE OF CHANCE The results of the linear regression in the 9-year-old
   children survived correction for multiple testing with false discovery
   rate (FDR). In Tier 1 where we examined PAE only before pregnancy
   (exposed N = 278, unexposed N = 760), we found three traits survived FDR
   correction. The lowest FDR-P is 1.7e-05 (beta = 0.021, SE = 0.0040) in
   Trait #29; In Tier 2b where we examine any PAE during first trimester
   (exposed N = 756; unexposed N = 760), we found eight traits survived FDR
   correction. The lowest FDR-P is 9.0e-03 (beta = -0.013, SE = 0.0033) in
   Trait #139. Moreover, more statistically significant facial traits were
   found in higher levels of PAE. No FDR-significant results were found in
   the 13-year-old children. We map these significant traits back to the
   face, and found the most common detected facial phenotypes included
   turned-up nose tip, shortened nose, turned-out chin, and turned-in
   lower-eyelid-related regions. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We had no
   data for alcohol consumption more than three months prior to pregnancy
   and thus do not know if maternal drinking had chronic effects. The
   self-reported questionnaire might not reflect accurate alcohol
   measurements because mothers may have denied their alcohol consumption.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our results imply that facial
   morphology, such as quantified by the approach we proposed here, can be
   used as a biomarker in further investigations. Furthermore, our study
   suggests that for women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant
   soon, should quit alcohol consumption several months before conception
   and completely during pregnancy to avoid adverse health outcomes in the
   offspring. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) This work was supported

AB Background Artificial intelligences (AIs) are emerging in the field of
   medical informatics in many areas. They are mostly used for diagnosis
   support in medical imaging but have potential uses in many other fields
   of medicine where large datasets are available. Aim To develop an
   artificial intelligence (AI) "ToxNet", a machine-learning based
   computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system, which aims to predict poisons
   based on patient's symptoms and metadata from our Poison Control Center
   (PCC) data. To prove its accuracy and compare it against medical doctors
   (MDs). Methods The CADx system was developed and trained using data from
   781,278 calls recorded in our PCC database from 2001 to 2019. All cases
   were mono-intoxications. Patient symptoms and meta-information (e.g.,
   age group, sex, etiology, toxin point of entry, weekday, etc.) were
   provided. In the pilot phase, the AI was trained on 10 substances, the
   AI's prediction was compared to naive matching, literature matching, a
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and the graph attention network (GAT). The
   trained AI's accuracy was then compared to 10 medical doctors in an
   individual and in an identical dataset. The dataset was then expanded to
   28 substances and the predictions and comparisons repeated. Results In
   the pilot, the prediction performance in a set of 8995 patients with 10
   substances was 0.66 +/- 0.01 (F1 micro score). Our CADx system was
   significantly superior to naive matching, literature matching, MLP, and
   GAT (p < 0.005). It outperformed our physicians experienced in clinical
   toxicology in the individual and identical dataset. In the extended
   dataset, our CADx system was able to predict the correct toxin in a set
   of 36,033 patients with 28 substances with an overall performance of
   0.27 +/- 0.01 (F1 micro score), also significantly superior to naive
   matching, literature matching, MLP, and GAT. It also outperformed our
   MDs. Conclusion Our AI trained on a large PCC database works well for
   poison prediction in these experiments. With further research, it might
   become a valuable aid for physicians in predicting unknown substances
   and might be the first step into AI use in PCCs.

AB Background: The workflow of prostate cancer diagnosis and grading is
   cumbersome and the results suffer from substantial inter-observer
   variability. Recent trials have shown potential in using machine
   learning to develop automated systems to address this challenge. Most
   automated deep learning systems for prostate cancer Gleason grading
   focused on supervised learning requiring demanding fine-grained
   pixel-level annotations. Methods: A weakly-supervised deep learning
   model with slide-level labels is presented in this study for the
   diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer with whole slide image (WSI).
   WSIs are first cropped into small patches and then processed with a deep
   learning model to extract patch-level features. A graph convolution
   network (GCN) is used to aggregate the features for classifications.
   Throughout the training process, the noisy labels are progressively
   filtered out to reduce inter-observer variations in clinical reports.
   Finally, multi-center independent test cohorts with 6,174 slides are
   collected to evaluate the prostate cancer diagnosis and grading
   performance of our model. Results: The cancer diagnosis (2-level
   classification) results on two external test sets (n = 4,675, n = 844)
   show an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
   0.985 and 0.986. The Gleason grading (6-level classification) results
   reach 0.931 quadratic weighted kappa on the internal test set (n = 531).
   It generalizes well on the external test dataset (n = 844) with 0.801
   quadratic weighted kappa with the reference standard set independently.
   The model enables pathological meaningful interpretability by
   visualizing the most attended lesions which are highly consistent with
   expert annotations. Conclusion: The proposed model incorporates a graph
   network in weakly supervised learning with only slide -level reports. A
   robust learning strategy is also employed to correct the label noise. It
   is highly accurate (> 0.985 AUC for diagnosis) and also interpretable
   with intuitive heatmap visualization. It can be unified with a digital
   pathology pipeline to deliver prostate cancer metrics for a pathology
   report.

AB Taxi demand prediction in a city is a highly demanded smart city
   research application for better traffic strategies formulation. It is
   essential for the interest of the commuters and the taxi companies both
   to have an accurate measure of taxi demands at different regions of a
   city and at varying time intervals. This reduces the cost of resources,
   efforts and meets the customers' satisfaction at its best. Modern
   predictive models have shown the potency of Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
   in this domain over any traditional, statistical, or Tensor-Based
   predictive models in terms of accuracy. The recent DNN models using
   leading technologies like Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Graph
   Convolution Networks (GCN), ConvLSTM, etc. are not able to efficiently
   capture the existing spatio-temporal characteristics in taxi demand
   time-series. The feature aggregation techniques in these models lack
   channeling and uniqueness causing less distinctive but overlapping
   feature space which results in a compromised prediction performance
   having high error propagation possibility. The present work introduces
   Spatio-Temporal Aggregator Predictor (ST-A(G)P), a DNN model which
   aggregates spatio-temporal features into (1) non-redundant and (2)
   highly distinctive feature space and in turn helps (3) reduce noise
   propagation for a high performing multi-step predictive model. The
   proposed model integrates the effective feature engineering techniques
   of machine learning approach with the non-linear capability of a DNN
   model. Consequently, the proposed model is able to use only the
   informative features responsible for the objective task with reduce
   noise propagation. Unlike, existing DNN models, ST-A(G)P is able to
   induce these qualities of feature aggregation without the use of
   Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach or any additional supervised
   attention that existing models need for their notable performance. A
   considerable high-performance gain of 25 - 37% on two real-world city
   taxi datasets by ST-A(G)P over the state-of-art models on standard
   benchmark metrics establishes the efficacy of the proposed model over
   the existing ones.

AB Edge computing places cloudlets with high computational capabilities
   near mobile devices to reduce the latency and network congestion
   encountered in cloud server-based task offloading. However, many
   cloudlets are required in such an edge computing network, leading to a
   tremendous increase in carbon emissions of computing networks globally.
   This increase in carbon emission envisages the need to employ green
   energy resources to power these cloudlets. This need has led to the
   concept of Green Cloudlet Networks (GCNs). But GCNs must deal with the
   problem of the unpredictability of green energy available to them while
   optimizing the performance (in terms of latency) delivered to the mobile
   user. This paper proposes a novel task-assignment called Green Energy
   and Latency Aware Task Assignment (Ge-LATA) for GCNs to address this
   issue. The primary aim of Ge-LATA is to optimize the latency and the
   green energy consumed in processing the offloaded tasks from the mobile
   devices. In this GCN, the cloudlets are connected in a network to
   process the incoming tasks cooperatively to ensure load-balancing at the
   cloudlets. Ge-LATA considers various factors like the current load,
   available green energy, service rate offered by cloudlets, and the
   distance from the mobile user, leading to optimal decisions in terms of
   latency and green energy consumed. Simulations are performed using the
   actual solar insolation data taken from the NREL database. Ge-LATA is
   tested with other offloading schemes for latency in processing the
   offloaded tasks and green energy consumed under different solar
   insolation scenarios in these simulations. Simulation results show that
   Ge-LATA achieves up to 31.87% of reduction in the latency while ensuring
   up to 50.15% of reduction in the energy consumption than other
   comparable task-assignment schemes.Thus, Ge-LATA suggests that it leads
   to an optimal task assignment by considering the various factors
   mentioned above during the task assignment process. Thus, Ge-LATA
   considers the above-mentioned extensive set of parameters during the
   task allotment process. It also proposes an efficient green energy
   allotment scheme that adapts itself to actual weather and network
   conditions, leading to optimal task assignment decisions in GCNs.

AB Metastasis on lymph nodes (LNs), the most common way of spread for
   primary tumor cells, is a sign of increased mortality. However,
   metastatic LNs are time-consuming and challenging to detect even for
   professional radiologists due to their small sizes, high sparsity, and
   ambiguity in appearance. It is desired to leverage recent development in
   deep learning to automatically detect metastatic LNs. Besides a
   two-stage detection network, we here introduce an additional branch to
   leverage information about LN stations, an important reference for
   radiologists during metastatic LN diagnosis, as supplementary
   information for metastatic LN detection. The branch targets to solve a
   closely related task on the LN station level, i.e., classifying whether
   an LN station contains metastatic LN or not, so as to learn
   representations for LN stations. Considering that a metastatic LN
   station is expected to significantly affect the nearby ones, a GCN-based
   structure is adopted by the branch to model the relationship among
   different LN stations. At the classification stage of metastatic LN
   detection, the above learned LN station features, as well as the
   features reflecting the distance between the LN candidate and the LN
   stations, are integrated with the LN features. We validate our method on
   a dataset containing 114 intravenous contrast-enhanced Computed
   Tomography (CT) images of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients
   and show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the
   mFROC, maxF1, and AUC scores, respectively.

AB Insulin plays important role in testicular functions such as germ cell
   proliferation and steroidogenesis, despite its conventional role as a
   hypoglycaemic agent. It is also well known that testicular activity is
   severely get affected by heat stress and heat stress induces testicular
   pathogenesis. The effect of insulin on heat-induced testicular
   impairment has not been investigated. Thus, it is hypothesized that
   insulin might modulate testicular activity in a heat-stressed model.
   Experimental mice were separated into 4 groups; the first group was the
   normal control (CN), and the second group was subjected to heat stress
   (HS) by submerging the lower body part in a thermostatically controlled
   water bath maintained at 43 degrees C for 15 min. The third and fourth
   groups were treated with a single dose of intra-testicular insulin (0.6
   IU/mice) before and after heat stress. Animal tissue samples were
   collected after 14 days of heat treatment. Insulin treatment did not
   improve the sperm parameters; however, both insulin pre and
   post-treatment improved the markers of spermatogenesis such as Johnsen
   score, germinal epithelium height and the number of stages VII/VIII. The
   histoarchitecture of testis also showed amelioration from heat-induced
   pathogenesis in the insulin-treated groups. Insulin treatment has also
   increased the proliferation of germ cells (increased PCNA and GCN),
   survival (Bcl2), and decreased apoptosis (active caspase-3).
   Furthermore, insulin treatment decreased MDA levels, without pronounced
   effects on the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Heat stress also
   decreased the circulating testosterone and oestrogen levels, and insulin
   treatment significantly increased oestrogen levels only. Although
   testosterone showed an increasing trend, it was insignificant. The
   expression of aromatase, AR, ER-alpha, and ER-beta was down regulated by
   heat-stress and insulin treatment up regulated these markers. In
   conclusion, our results showed the amelioration of heat-induced
   testicular impairment by pre and post-intra-testicular insulin
   treatments. Insulin-associated improvements in the pre-and
   post-treatment groups suggested a preventive mechanism of insulin
   against heat stress in the testis.

AB Software knowledge community contains a large scale of software
   knowledge entity information, complex structure and rich semantic
   correlations. It is significant to recognize and extract software
   knowledge entity from software knowledge community, as it has great
   impact on entity-centric tasks such as software knowledge graph
   construction, software document generation and expert recommendation.
   Since the texts of the software knowledge community are unstructured by
   user-generated texts, it is difficult to apply the traditional entity
   extraction method in the domain of the software knowledge community due
   to the problems of entity variation, entity sparsity, entity ambiguity,
   out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and the lack of annotated data sets. This
   paper proposes a novel software knowledge entity extraction model, named
   AttenSy-SNER, which integrates syntactic features and semantic
   augmentation information, to extract fine-grained software knowledge
   entities from unstructured user-generated content. The input
   representation layer utilizes Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
   Transformers (BERT) model to extract the feature representation of the
   input sequence. The contextual coding layer leverages the Bidirectional
   Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network and Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) for contextual information and syntactic dependency information,
   and a semantic augmentation strategy based on attention mechanism is
   introduced to enrich the semantic feature representation of sequences as
   well. The tag decoding layer leverages Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
   to solve the dependency between the output tags and obtain the global
   optimal label sequence. The results of model comparison experiments show
   that the proposed model has better performance than the benchmark model
   in software engineering domain.

AB 3D skeleton data has been widely used in action recognition as the
   skeleton-based method has achieved good performance in complex dynamic
   environments. The rise of spatio-temporal graph convolutions has
   attracted much attention to use graph convolution to extract spatial and
   temporal features together in the field of skeleton-based action
   recognition. However, due to the huge difference in the focus of spatial
   and temporal features, it is difficult to improve the efficiency of
   extracting the spatiotemporal features. In this paper, we propose a
   channel attention and multi-scale neural network (CA-MSN) for
   skeleton-based action recognition with a series of spatio-temporal
   extraction modules. We exploit the relationship of body joints
   hierarchically through two modules, i.e., a spatial module which uses
   the residual GCN network with the channel attention block to extract the
   high-level spatial features, and a temporal module which uses the
   multi-scale TCN network to extract the temporal features at different
   scales. We perform extensive experiments on both the NTU-RGBD60 and
   NTU-RGBD120 datasets to verify the effectiveness of our network. The
   comparison results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art
   performance with the competitive computing speed. In order to test the
   application effect of our CA-MSN model, we design a multi-task tandem
   network consisting of 2D pose estimation, 2D to 3D pose regression and
   skeleton action recognition model. The end-to-end (RGB video-to-action
   type) recognition effect is demonstrated. The code is available at
   https://github.com/Rh-Dang/CA-MSN-action-recognition.git.

AB In some stock markets, stock prices are not allowed to rise above a
   daily limit to restrain the surge of price (called price limit). When
   the price limit occurs, investors tend to chase the continuing upward
   momentum for profit-making. However, For the stocks that hit daily price
   limit, we observe whether they close at daily price limit will lead to
   the opposite price trends of the next trading day. Therefore, this work
   aims to predict whether a stock that hits its daily price limit will
   also close at the same price level (i.e., Type I or Type II). The
   occurrence of price limit is driven by different levels of market state.
   For example, it can result from macro-economic changes of the whole
   market, or it can be traced to some industry-specific factors. A
   challenging task is to learn a better stock representation with less
   uncertainty by comprehensively considering the hierarchical property of
   market state. Accordingly, we design a novel hierarchical architecture,
   called Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN), to investigate the
   market state at hierarchical view for stock type prediction. In HGNN, we
   construct the stock relation graph and merge stock information
   hierarchically extracted from multiple views of market state, including
   node view, relation view and graph view, which takes both historical
   sequence pattern and stock relation into consideration. Our key
   innovation is the introduction of hierarchical structure makes the
   predictive model able to more comprehensively infer the hierarchical
   property of market state. Further, it also provides the deeper insight
   for the actual investment practice. To validate the effectiveness of our
   method, we conduct back-testing on the two-year historical data of more
   than 2500 main-board stocks in two China stock markets, SSE and SZSE. To
   support further study of the stock type prediction task, we have
   published two longrange stock datasets (Datasets are available at
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/
   1TXiAyqt3rHveuzdGT6YtswU1e-tBSFUe/view?usp=sharing). Extensive
   experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
   solutions including ALSTM, GCN and GAT with the improvements of at least
   3.54% on average in accuracy. In addition, the average return ratio of
   SSE and SZSE has improved by 18.57% and 8.75%, respectively.(c) 2022

AB Extracellular amino acid (AA) withdrawal/restriction invokes an

   operating in conjunction or independently of GCN2/ATF4 to upregulate
   SNAT2. Herein, we show that whilst pharmacological inhibition of
   MEK-ERK, mTORC1 and p38 MAP kinase signalling has no detectable effect
   on System A upregulation, inhibitors targeting GSK3 (e.g. SB415286)
   caused significant repression of the SNAT2 adaptation response.
   Strikingly, the effects of SB415286 persist in cells in which GSK3
   alpha/beta have been stably silenced indicating an off-target effect. We
   show that SB415286 can also inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and
   that roscovitine and flavopiridol (two pan CDR inhibitors) are effective
   repressors of the SNAT2 adaptive response. In particular, our work
   reveals that CDK7 activity is upregulated in AA-deprived cells in a
   GCN-2-dependent manner and that a potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor,
   THZ-1, not only attenuates the increase in ATF4 expression but blocks
   System A adaptation. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of THZ-1 on
   System A adaptation are mitigated in cells expressing a
   doxycycline-inducible drug-resistant form of CDK7. Our data identify
   CDK7 as a novel component of the ISR regulating System A adaptation in
   response to AA insufficiency.

AB The development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology promotes the
   advances of grain condition detection and analysis systems. Temperature
   monitoring is a main element to maintain grain quality, and effective
   control of grain temperature is crucial to safe storage of grain. In
   this article, an encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism is
   proposed to accurately forecast the temperature of stored grain.
   Considering that the points on the gradient direction of the temperature
   surface have a great influence on the temperature of the target point,
   the Sobel operator is used to extract the local characteristics of the
   target point. In addition, considering the correlation structure in the
   sensory data, the attention mechanism is used to extract the global
   features of the target point. The extracted spatial features are fed
   into long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to obtain the long-term
   state information of spatial factors. LSTM unit and convolutional neural
   network are used to encode the spatial features of the target points.
   Taking meteorological factors as the external input of the decoder,
   temporal attention mechanism and LSTM unit are used to complete the
   decoding process and realize the prediction of grain temperature in the
   future. The results with real grain storage data show that the proposed
   model outperforms several schemes, including Kalman-modified the least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Kalman-modified LASSO),
   temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN), LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and
   convolutional LSTM (Conv-LSTM), with considerable gains.

AB To cope with nutrient scarcity, plants generally follow two main
   complementary strategies. On the one hand, they can slow down growing,
   mainly shoot growth, to diminish the demand of nutrients. We can call
   this strategy as "stop growing." On the other hand, plants can develop
   different physiological and morphological responses, mainly in their
   roots, aimed to facilitate the acquisition of nutrients. We can call
   this second strategy as "searching for nutrients." Both strategies are
   compatible and can function simultaneously but the interconnection
   between them is not yet well-known. In relation to the "stop growing"
   strategy, it is known that the TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) system is a
   central regulator of growth in response to nutrients in eukaryotic
   cells. TOR is a protein complex with kinase activity that promotes
   protein synthesis and growth while some SnRK (Sucrose non-fermenting
   1-Related protein Kinases) and GCN (General Control Non-derepressible)
   kinases act antagonistically. It is also known that some SnRKs and GCNs
   are activated by nutrient deficiencies while TOR is active under
   nutrient sufficiency. In relation to the "searching for nutrients"
   strategy, it is known that the plant hormone ethylene participates in
   the activation of many nutrient deficiency responses. In this Mini
   Review, we discuss the possible role of ethylene as the hub connecting
   the "stop growing" strategy and the "searching for nutrients" strategy
   since very recent results also suggest a clear relationship of ethylene
   with the TOR system.

AB Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays an important role in drug
   repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. However, due to the large
   size of the chemical and genomic spaces and the complex interactions
   between drugs and targets, experimental identification of DTIs is costly
   and time-consuming. In recent years, the emerging graph neural network
   (GNN) has been applied to DTI prediction because DTIs can be represented
   effectively using graphs. However, some of these methods are only based
   on homogeneous graphs, and some consist of two decoupled steps that
   cannot be trained jointly. To further explore GNN-based DTI prediction
   by integrating heterogeneous graph information, this study regards DTI
   prediction as a link prediction problem and proposes an end-to-end model
   based on HETerogeneous graph with Attention mechanism (DTI-HETA). In
   this model, a heterogeneous graph is first constructed based on the
   drug-drug and target-target similarity matrices and the DTI matrix.
   Then, the graph convolutional neural network is utilized to obtain the
   embedded representation of the drugs and targets. To highlight the
   contribution of different neighborhood nodes to the central node in
   aggregating the graph convolution information, a graph attention
   mechanism is introduced into the node embedding process. Afterward, an
   inner product decoder is applied to predict DTIs. To evaluate the
   performance of DTI-HETA, experiments are conducted on two datasets. The
   experimental results show that our model is superior to the
   state-of-the-art methods. Also, the identification of novel DTIs
   indicates that DTI-HETA can serve as a powerful tool for integrating
   heterogeneous graph information to predict DTIs.

AB Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based methods have made great
   progress in mechanical fault diagnosis under variable working
   conditions. In UDA, three types of information, including class label,
   domain label, and data structure, are essential to bridging the labeled
   source domain and unlabeled target domain. However, most existing
   UDA-based methods use only the former two information and ignore the
   modeling of data structure, which make the information contained in the
   features extracted by the deep network incomplete. To tackle this issue,
   a domain adversarial graph convolutional network (DAGCN) is proposed to
   model the three types of information in a unified deep network and
   achieving UDA. The first two types of information are modeled by the
   classifier and the domain discriminator, respectively. In data structure
   modeling, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first employed to
   exact features from input signals. After that, the CNN features are
   input to the proposed graph generation layer to construct instance
   graphs by mining the relationship of structural characteristics of
   samples. Then, the instance graphs are modeled by a graph convolutional
   network, and the maximum mean discrepancy metric is leveraged to
   estimate the structure discrepancy of instance graphs from different
   domains. Experimental results conducted on two case studies demonstrate
   that the proposed DAGCN can not only obtain the best performance among
   the comparison methods, but also can extract transferable features for
   domain adaptation. The code library is available at:
   https://github.com/HazeDT/DAGCN.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) causes quite a few blindness worldwide, which
   can be refrained by the timely diagnosis on retinal images. Recently,
   researches on deep learning-based retinal image classification have
   accelerated outstanding improvements in DR grading task. However,
   existing DR grading works are mostly limited to a supervised manner.
   They require accurately annotated data labeled by professional experts,
   and the annotating work is very laborious and time-consuming. We propose
   a Semi-supervised Auto-encoder Graph Network (SAGN) for the challenging
   DR diagnosis to relax this constraint. Precisely, SAGN consists of three
   major modules: auto-encoder feature learning, neighbor correlation
   mining, and graph representation. Firstly, our model learns to extract
   representations from retinal images and reconstruct them as close to
   original inputs as possible. Then neighbor correlations among labeled
   and unlabeled samples are established by their similarities, calculated
   by the radial basis function. Finally, we operate Graph Convolutional
   Neural Network (GCN) to grade retinal samples from extracted features
   and their correlations. To evaluate the performance of SAGN, we conduct
   sufficient comparative experiments on APTOS 2019 dataset, trained from
   EyePACS. Results demonstrate that our SAGN model can achieve comparable
   performance with limited labeled retinal images with the help of large
   amounts of unlabeled data.

AB Road link speed is often employed as an essential measure of traffic
   state in the operation of an urban traffic network. Not only real-time
   traffic demand but also signal timings and other local planning factors
   are major influential factors. This paper proposes a short-term traffic
   speed prediction approach, called PL-WGAN, for urban road networks,
   which is considered an important part of a novel parallel learning
   framework for traffic control and operation. The proposed method applies
   Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGAN) for robust data-driven
   traffic modeling using a combination of generative neural network and
   discriminative neural network. The generative neural network models the
   road link features of the adjacent intersections and the control
   parameters of intersections using a hybrid graph block. In addition, the
   spatial-temporal relations are captured by stacking a graph
   convolutional network (GCN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and an
   attention mechanism. A comprehensive computational experiment was
   carried out including comparing model prediction and computational
   performances with several state-of-the-art deep learning models. The
   proposed approach has been implemented and applied for predicting
   short-term link traffic speed in a large-scale urban road network in
   Hangzhou, China. The results suggest that it provides a scalable and
   effective traffic prediction solution for urban road networks.

AB In view of most current studies on text sentiment classification focus
   on the deep learning model to obtain the sentimental characteristics of
   English text. Chinese text sentiment analysis is rarely involved, and
   only the context information of the statement is considered, but the
   syntax information of the statement is rarely considered. In this paper,
   a novel sentiment classification model is proposed (Dependency Tree
   Graph Convolutional Network, DTGCN) combined Chinese syntactically
   dependent tree with graph convolution. Firstly, the Bi-GRU
   (Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit) model is used to learn the
   contextual feature representation of a given text. Secondly, the
   syntax-dependent tree structure of a given text is constructed, then
   obtain its adjacency matrix according to the syntax-dependent tree, with
   the initial features extracted from the bidirectional gate control
   network, input into the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to
   extract the sentimental features of the text; the obtained sentimental
   characteristics are then input into the classifier SoftMax for text
   sentimental polarity classification. Finally, the data set is compared
   with the mainstream neural network model. The experimental results show
   that the accuracy of the proposed DTGCN model proposed on the data set
   is 90.51% and the recall rate is 90.34%. Compared with the benchmark
   models (LSTM, CNN, TextCNN and Bi-GRU), the proposed DTGCN model shows a
   4.45% advantage in accuracy. It shows that the proposed DTGCN model can
   effectively use the grammatical information of Chinese text to mine the
   hidden relationship in statements, it can improve the accuracy of
   Chinese text sentiment classification. In addition, the proposed DTGCN
   model not only improves the performance of sentiment classification in
   the essay, it also provides a new research method for social network
   public opinion identification. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by

AB The present work aims to find a suitable morphology of graphitic carbon
   nitride (g-CN) for electrocatalytic applications which includes bulk
   g-CN (g-CNB), g-CN nanosheets (g-CNNS) and g-CN quantum dots (gCND). The
   different morphologies of g-CN were synthesized by solid-phase thermal
   method using urea, citric acid and trisodium citrate as precursors. The
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of g-CNs showed characteristic 2 theta
   values due to (002) interlayer diffraction and (100) in-plane structural
   packing. The g-CN with the morphology of bulk, sheets and dots were then
   attached directly on GC electrode by immersing it into the respective
   gCN solution. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that
   the g-CNB coated on GC plate displays layer like structure whereas
   g-CNNS exhibits crumpled and enfolded thin sheets like graphene. The SEM
   image of g-CND coated GC plate shows that they were uniformly covered
   the whole area as dots with the size of 30 nm. Under optimized
   conditions, the electrochemical impedance studies showed that the order
   of the charge transfer resistance was as follows: g-CNNS <g-CND < g-CNB
   < GC. The impact of g-CN morphology on the oxidation of ascorbic acid
   (AA) and dopamine (DA) and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (HP) was
   studied at pH 7.2 phosphate buffer (PB) solution. The g-CNs modified
   electrodes irrespective of the morphology enhanced the electrocatalytic
   activity in contrast to bare GC electrode. Among the three g-CNs,
   GC/g-CNNS electrode exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity towards
   all the three analytes. The cause for the higher electrocatalytic
   activity was attributed to its higher electroactive surface area and
   faster electron transfer rate in contrast to GC/g-CNB and GC/g-CND
   electrodes. Further, GC/g-CNNS electrode was effectively used for the
   sensitive determination of HP. While increasing its concentration from
   100 nM to 1 mM, HP reduction current increases linearly with R2 value of
   0.9905 and LOD was 11 nM (S/N = 3). Finally, GC/g-CNNS electrode was
   successfully used to quantify HP in blood serum samples.

AB Cumulative research studies have verified that multiple circRNAs are
   closely associated with the pathogenic mechanism and cellular level.
   Exploring human circRNA-disease relationships is significant to decipher
   pathogenic mechanisms and provide treatment plans. At present, several
   computational models are designed to infer potential relationships
   between diseases and circRNAs. However, the majority of existing
   approaches could not effectively utilize the multisource data and
   achieve poor performance in sparse networks. In this study, we develop
   an advanced method, GATGCN, using graph attention network (GAT) and
   graph convolutional network (GCN) to detect potential circRNA-disease
   relationships. First, several sources of biomedical information are
   fused via the centered kernel alignment model (CKA), which calculates
   the corresponding weight of different kernels. Second, we adopt the
   graph attention network to learn latent representation of diseases and
   circRNAs. Third, the graph convolutional network is deployed to
   effectively extract features of associations by aggregating feature
   vectors of neighbors. Meanwhile, GATGCN achieves the prominent AUC of
   0.951 under leave-one-out cross-validation and AUC of 0.932 under 5-fold
   cross-validation. Furthermore, case studies on lung cancer, diabetes
   retinopathy, and prostate cancer verify the reliability of GATGCN for
   detecting latent circRNA-disease pairs.

AB Since graph learning could preserve the structure information of the
   samples to improve the learning ability, it has been widely applied in
   both shallow learning and deep learning. However, the current graph
   learning methods still suffer from the issues such as outlier influence
   and model robustness. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic graph
   neural network (DGCN) method to conduct semi-supervised classification
   on multi-view data by jointly conducting the graph learning and the
   classification task in a unified framework. Specifically, our method
   investigates three strategies to improve the quality of the graph before
   feeding it into the GCN model: (i) employing robust statistics to
   consider the sample importance for reducing the outlier influence, i.e.
   assigning every sample with soft weights so that the important samples
   are with large weights and outliers are with small or even zero weights;
   (ii) learning the common representation across all views to improve the
   quality of the graph for every view; and (iii) learning the
   complementary information from all initial graphs on multi-view data to
   further improve the learning of the graph for every view. As a result,
   each of the strategies could improve the robustness of the DGCN model.
   Moreover, they are complementary for reducing outlier influence from
   different aspects, i.e. the sample importance reduces the weights of the
   outliers, both the common representation and the complementary
   information improve the quality of the graph for every view.
   Experimental result on real data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of
   our method, compared to the comparison methods, in terms of multi-class
   classification performance.

AB Address matching is a crucial task in various location-based businesses
   like take-out services and express delivery, which aims at identifying
   addresses referring to the same location in address databases. It is a
   challenging one due to various possible ways to express the address of a
   location, especially in Chinese. Traditional address matching approaches
   relying on string similarities and learning matching rules to identify
   addresses referring to the same location, could hardly solve the cases
   with redundant, incomplete or unusual expression of addresses. In this
   paper, to learn the geographical semantic representations for address
   strings, we novelly propose to get rich contexts for addresses from the
   Web through Web search engines, which could strongly enrich the semantic
   meaning of addresses that could be learned. Apart from that, we propose
   a two-stage geographical address representation learning model for
   address matching. In the first stage, we propose to use an
   encode-decoder architecture to learn the semantic vector representation
   for each address string where an up-sampling and sub-sampling strategy
   is applied to solve the problem of address redundancy and
   incompleteness. The attention mechanism is also applied to the model to
   highlight important features of addresses in their semantic
   representations. And in the second stage, we construct a single large
   graph from the corpus, which contains address elements and addresses as
   nodes, and the edges between nodes are built by word co-occurrence
   information to learn embedding representations for all the nodes on the
   graph. Our empirical study conducted on two real-world address datasets
   demonstrates that our approach greatly improves both precision (up to
   8%) and recall (up to 12%) of the state-of-the-art existing methods.

AB The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) F/GCN (general control non-derepressible)
   subfamily is a group of soluble ABC proteins that has two nucleotide
   binding domains (NBDs) but no transmembrane domains (TMDs). Previous
   study has indicated that ABCF3, also called GCN20/SCORD5, is involved in
   stress-associated protein translation control and defense responses to
   bacterial infection. Here, we show that ABCF3 regulates H2O2 uptake and
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in Arabidopsis. ABCF3
   expressed mainly in leaves, stems, root tips, seeds, and anther.
   Analysis of abcf3 mutants and transgenic overexpressors (OX) of ABCF3
   indicates that ABCF3 regulates H2O2 uptake. qRT-PCR analysis indicated
   that ABCF3 affects the expression of several aquaporin genes that were
   involved in H2O2 uptake in plants. In addition, abcf3 mutants exhibited
   enhanced sensitivity to ER stress and amino acid deprivation when
   challenged with ER stress inducers tunicamycin and amino acid synthesis
   inhibitor chlorsulfuron compared to wild type. Overexpression of AtABCF3
   increases, whereas, abcf3 mutants depress the expression of ER
   stress-related genes. Taken together, these results indicated that ABCF3
   regulates stress response by modulating aquaporin gene expression and ER
   stress responses.

AB Background and objective: Cancer, as the most challenging part in the
   human disease history, has always been one of the main threats to human
   life and health. The high mortality of cancer is largely due to the
   complexity of cancer and the significant differences in clinical
   outcomes. Therefore, it will be significant to improve accuracy of
   cancer survival prediction, which has become one of the main fields of
   cancer research. Many calculation models for cancer survival prediction
   have been proposed at present, but most of them generate prediction
   models only by using single genomic data or clinical data. Multiple
   genomic data and clinical data have not been integrated yet to take a
   comprehensive consideration of cancers and predict their survival.
   Method: In order to effectively integrate multiple genomic data
   (including genetic expression, copy number alteration, DNA methylation
   and exon expression) and clinical data and apply them to predictive
   studies on cancer survival, similar network fusion algorithm (SNF) was
   proposed in this paper to integrate multiple genomic data and clinical
   data so as to generate sample similarity matrix, min-redundancy and
   max-relevance algorithm (mRMR) was used to conduct feature selection of
   multiple genomic data and clinical data of cancer samples and generate
   sample feature matrix, and finally two matrixes were used for
   semi-supervised training through graph convolutional network (GCN) so as
   to obtain a cancer survival prediction method integrating multiple
   genomic data and clinical data based on graph convolutional network
   (GCGCN). Result: Performance indexes of GCGCN model indicate that both
   multiple genomic data and clinical data play significant roles in the
   accurate survival time prediction of cancer patients. It is compared
   with existing survival prediction methods, and results show that cancer
   survival prediction method GCGCN which integrates multiple genomic data
   and clinical data has obviously superior prediction effect than existing
   survival prediction methods. Conclusion: All study results in this paper
   have verified effectiveness and superiority of GCGCN in the aspect of
   cancer survival prediction.

AB The 16S ribosomal RNA gene is the most widely used marker gene in
   microbial ecology. Counts of 16S sequence variants, often in PCR
   amplicons, are used to estimate proportions of bacterial and archaeal
   taxa in microbial communities. Because different organisms contain
   different 16S gene copy numbers (GCNs), sequence variant counts are
   biased towards clades with greater GCNs. Several tools have recently
   been developed for predicting GCNs using phylogenetic methods and based
   on sequenced genomes, in order to correct for these biases. However, the
   accuracy of those predictions has not been independently assessed. Here,
   we systematically evaluate the predictability of 16S GCNs across
   bacterial and archaeal clades, based on similar to 6,800 public
   sequenced genomes and using several phylogenetic methods. Further, we
   assess the accuracy of GCNs predicted by three recently published tools
   (PICRUSt, CopyRighter, and PAPRICA) over a wide range of taxa and for
   635 microbial communities from varied environments. We find that
   regardless of the phylogenetic method tested, 16S GCNs could only be
   accurately predicted for a limited fraction of taxa, namely taxa with
   closely to moderately related representatives (less than or similar to
   15% divergence in the 16S rRNA gene). Consistent with this observation,
   we find that all considered tools exhibit low predictive accuracy when
   evaluated against completely sequenced genomes, in some cases explaining
   less than 10% of the variance. Substantial disagreement was also
   observed between tools (R-2 < 0.5) for the majority of tested microbial
   communities. The nearest sequenced taxon index (NSTI) of microbial
   communities, i.e., the average distance to a sequenced genome, was a
   strong predictor for the agreement between GCN prediction tools on
   non-animal-associated samples, but only a moderate predictor for
   animal-associated samples. We recommend against correcting for 16S GCNs
   in microbiome surveys by default, unless OTUs are sufficiently closely
   related to sequenced genomes or unless a need for true OTU proportions
   warrants the additional noise introduced, so that community profiles
   remain interpretable and comparable between studies.

AB Driver attention prediction is becoming an essential research problem in
   human-like driving systems. This work makes an attempt to predict the
   driver attention in driving accident scenarios (DADA). However,
   challenges tread on the heels of that because of the dynamic traffic
   scene, intricate and imbalanced accident categories. In this work, we
   design a semantic context induced attentive fusion network (SCAFNet). We
   first segment the RGB video frames into the images with different
   semantic regions (i.e., semantic images), where each region denotes one
   semantic category of the scene (e.g., road, trees, etc.), and learn the
   spatio-temporal features of RGB frames and semantic images in two
   parallel paths simultaneously. Then, the learned features are fused by
   an attentive fusion network to find the semantic-induced scene variation
   in driver attention prediction. The contributions are three folds. 1)
   With the semantic images, we introduce their semantic context features
   and verify the manifest promotion effect for helping the driver
   attention prediction, where the semantic context features are modeled by
   a graph convolution network (GCN) on semantic images; 2) We fuse the
   semantic context features of semantic images and the features of RGB
   frames in an attentive strategy, and the fused details are transferred
   over frames by a convolutional LSTM module to obtain the attention map
   of each video frame with the consideration of historical scene variation
   in driving situations; 3) The superiority of the proposed method is
   evaluated on our previously collected dataset (named as DADA-2000) and
   two other challenging datasets with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted considerable attention
   since the skeleton data is more robust to the dynamic circumstances and
   complicated backgrounds than other modalities. Recently, many
   researchers have used the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model
   spatial-temporal features of skeleton sequences by an end-to-end
   optimization. However, conventional GCNs are feedforward networks for
   which it is impossible for the shallower layers to access semantic
   information in the high-level layers. In this paper, we propose a novel
   network, named Feedback Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN). This is the
   first work that introduces a feedback mechanism into GCNs for action
   recognition. Compared with conventional GCNs, FGCN has the following
   advantages: (1) A multi-stage temporal sampling strategy is designed to
   extract spatial-temporal features for action recognition in a coarse to
   fine process; (2) A Feedback Graph Convolutional Block (FGCB) is
   proposed to introduce dense feedback connections into the GCNs. It
   transmits the high-level semantic features to the shallower layers and
   conveys temporal information stage by stage to model video level
   spatial-temporal features for action recognition; (3) The FGCN model
   provides predictions on-the-fly. In the early stages, its predictions
   are relatively coarse. These coarse predictions are treated as priors to
   guide the feature learning in later stages, to obtain more accurate
   predictions. Extensive experiments on three datasets, NTU-RGB+D,
   NTU-RGB+D120 and Northwestern-UCLA, demonstrate that the proposed FGCN
   is effective for action recognition. It achieves the state-of-the-art
   performance on all three datasets.

AB For semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSI), trade-off
   between representation power and location accuracy is quite important.
   How to get the trade-off effectively is an open question, where current
   approaches of utilizing very deep models result in complex models with
   large memory consumption. In contrast to previous work that utilizes
   dilated convolutions or deep models, we propose a novel two-stream deep
   neural network for semantic segmentation of RSI (RSI-Net) to obtain
   improved performance through modeling and propagating spatial contextual
   structure effectively and a decoding scheme with image-level and
   graph-level combination. The first component explicitly models
   correlations between adjacent land covers and conduct flexible
   convolution on arbitrarily irregular image regions by using graph
   convolutional network, while densely connected atrous convolution
   network (DenseAtrousCNet) with multi-scale atrous convolution can expand
   the receptive fields and obtain image global information. Extensive
   experiments are implemented on the Vaihingen, Potsdam and Gaofen RSI
   datasets, where the comparison results demonstrate the superior
   performance of RSI-Net in terms of overall accuracy (91.83%, 93.31% and
   93.67% on three datasets, respectively), F1 score (90.3%, 91.49% and
   89.35% on three datasets, respectively) and kappa coefficient (89.46%,
   90.46% and 90.37% on three datasets, respectively) when compared with
   six state-of-the-art RSI semantic segmentation methods.

AB Traffic patterns of urban road intersections are important in traffic
   monitoring and accident prediction, thus play crucial roles in urban
   traffic management. Although real-time traffic information is
   consistently provided by surveillance cameras equipped at road
   intersections, the sparsity of surveillance distribution poses great
   challenges in performing a complete real-time traffic pattern analysis.
   To tackle that, existing works either assume that the traffic patterns
   are static, or assume a multi-variant distribution model for
   intersection traffic volumes. The former assumption neglects the
   temporal features of traffic patterns, and the latter is limited in
   capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To tackle the
   problem, we propose a novel framework, SpatioTemporal-Generative
   Adversarial Network (ST-GAN), that exploits deep spatiotemporal features
   of urban networks and offers accurate traffic pattern inferences with
   incomplete surveillance information. The ST-GAN framework incorporates a
   modified GCN network wired with the encoder-decoder mechanism and an
   LSTM network, which are further boosted by an iterative adversarial
   training process. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets show that
   ST-GAN achieves better inference accuracies than state-of-the-art
   solutions.

AB Because traffic flow data has complex spatial dependence and temporal
   correlation, it is a challenging problem for researchers in the field of
   Intelligent Transportation to accurately predict traffic flow by
   analyzing spatio-temporal traffic data. Based on the idea of
   spatio-temporal data fusion, fully considering the correlation of
   traffic flow data in the time dimension and the dependence of spatial
   structure, this paper proposes a new spatio-temporal traffic flow
   prediction model based on Graph Neural Network (GNN), which is called
   Bidirectional-Graph Recurrent Convolutional Network (Bi-GRCN). First,
   aiming at the spatial dependence between traffic flow data and traffic
   roads, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) which can directly analyze
   complex non-Euclidean space data is selected for spatial dependence
   modeling, to extract the spatial dependence characteristics. Second,
   considering the temporal dependence of traffic flow data on historical
   data and future data in its time-series period, Bidirectional-Gate
   Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) is used to process historical data and future
   data at the same time, to learn the temporal correlation characteristics
   of data in the bidirectional time dimension from the input data.
   Finally, the full connection layer is used to fuse the extracted spatial
   features and the learned temporal features to optimize the prediction
   results so that the Bi-GRCN model can better extract the spatial
   dependence and temporal correlation of traffic flow data. The
   experimental results show that the model can not only effectively
   predict the short-term traffic flow but also get a good prediction
   effect in the medium- and long-term traffic flow prediction.

AB The task of point cloud upsampling aims to acquire dense and uniform
   point sets from sparse and irregular point sets. Although significant
   progress has been made with deep learning models, state-of-the-art
   methods require ground-truth dense point sets as the supervision, which
   makes them limited to be trained under synthetic paired training data
   and not suitable to be under real-scanned sparse data. However, it is
   expensive and tedious to obtain large numbers of paired sparse-dense
   point sets as supervision from real-scanned sparse data. To address this
   problem, we propose a self-supervised point cloud upsampling network,
   named SPU-Net, to capture the inherent upsampling patterns of points
   lying on the underlying object surface. Specifically, we propose a
   coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework, which contains two main
   components: point feature extraction and point feature expansion,
   respectively. In the point feature extraction, we integrate the
   self-attention module with the graph convolution network (GCN) to
   capture context information inside and among local regions
   simultaneously. In the point feature expansion, we introduce a
   hierarchically learnable folding strategy to generate upsampled point
   sets with learnable 2D grids. Moreover, to further optimize the noisy
   points in the generated point sets, we propose a novel self-projection
   optimization associated with uniform and reconstruction terms as a joint
   loss to facilitate the self-supervised point cloud upsampling. We
   conduct various experiments on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets,
   and the results demonstrate that we achieve comparable performances to
   state-of-the-art supervised methods.

AB With the more and more in-depth research on intelligent transportation,
   many scholars have proposed their models for accurate prediction of
   traffic. In this paper, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of
   the existing models and propose our own model. In our model, the
   temporal and spatial factors are taken into account. Gate Recurrent Unit
   (GRU) and Gated Linear Units (GLU) are used to learn the short-term
   temporal features of traffic data, and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   is used to learn the spatial features of traffic data. In order to fully
   learn short-term feature changes, a multi time step perception layer is
   proposed. A new network GCGRU is proposed to learn the long-term
   features of traffic data. As the sensor will be affected by urban
   canyon, weather, and other factors, there will be missing value and
   noise in the collected data. We created a short-term trend based missing
   value filling up algorithm to fill in missing values and use Singular
   Spectrum Analysis (SSA) algorithm to eliminate noise of training data
   set. In order to reduce the process of adjusting parameters manually in
   the model training process, we propose k-block search method based on
   fuzzy extreme points. Finally, the model is compared with the existing
   traffic forecasting models, and the analysis results show that our model
   has advantages in many indicators.

AB Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that analysis of bio-signals
   such as rest state electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data can
   provide more reliable evaluation of children autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) than traditional methods of behavior measurement relying on scales
   do. However, the effectiveness of the new approaches still lags behind
   the increasing requirement in clinical or educational practices as the
   "bio-marker" information carried by the bio-signal of a single-modality
   is likely insufficient or distorted. This study proposes an approach to
   joint analysis of EEG and eye-tracking for children ASD evaluation. The
   approach focuses on deep fusion of the features in two modalities as no
   explicit correlations between the original bio-signals are available,
   which also limits the performance of existing methods along this
   direction. First, the synchronization measures, information entropy, and
   time-frequency features of the multi-channel EEG are derived. Then a
   random forest applies to the eye-tracking recordings of the same
   subjects to single out the most significant features. A graph
   convolutional network (GCN) model then naturally fuses the two group of
   features to differentiate the children with ASD from the typically
   developed (TD) subjects. Experiments have been carried out on the two
   types of the bio-signals collected from 42 children (21 ASD and 21 TD
   subjects, 3-6 years old). The results indicate that (1) the proposed
   approach can achieve an accuracy of 95% in ASD detection, and (2) strong
   correlations exist between the two bio-signals collected even
   asynchronously, in particular the EEG synchronization against the face
   related/joint attentions in terms of covariance.

AB In recent years, neurological disorders have globally become a leading
   cause of disability and death. Neurological disorders are very common in
   both high- and low-income countries, and the number of patients is
   predicted to increase in the coming decades. Disorders caused by the
   expanded trinucleotide repeats (CAG, CGG, CCG, CTG, CUG, GAA, and GCN)
   in the genome, also described as trinucleotide repeat expansion
   disorders (TREDs), comprise of the major class of neurological diseases.
   Various TREDs have different modes of pathogenesis, but the severity and
   time of onset of disease depends on the trinucleotide repeat numbers.
   Numerous therapeutic strategies, including symptomatic treatment,
   blockage of mutant protein synthesis, targeting the toxic protein
   aggregates and degradation of RNA transcripts have been developed for
   the treatment of these diseases. However, various limitations to these
   therapeutic strategies have been reported, and therefore, researchers
   are exploring different avenues of therapeutics development. One of the
   recent developments include targeting the expanded repeats with small
   molecules. Small molecule binds with the secondary/tertiary structure of
   RNA (like bulges, loops, and hairpins) irrespective of its sequences.
   Altogether, small molecule-based therapeutics may have the advantage
   over others to be able to overcome the hurdles of the blood-brain
   barrier, poor absorption, and allergic reactions. In this review, we
   have summarized various TREDs and envisage the potential of small
   molecule-based therapeutics for targeting these hitherto incurable
   neurological disorders.

AB Commuting flow prediction is a crucial issue for transport optimization
   and urban planning. However, the two existing types of solutions have
   inherent flaws. One is traditional models, such as the gravity model and
   radiation model. These models rely on fixed and simple mathematical
   formulas derived from physics, and ignore rich geographic semantics,
   which makes them difficult to model complex human mobility patterns. The
   other is the machine learning models, most of which simply leverage the
   features of Origin-Destination (OD), ignoring the topological nature of
   the interaction network and the spatial correlation brought by the
   nearby areas. In this paper, we propose a
   'preprocessing-encoder-decoder' hybrid learning model, which can make
   full use of geographic semantic information and spatial neighborhood
   effects, thereby significantly improving the prediction performance.
   Specifically, in the preprocessing part, we divide the study area into
   grids, and then incorporates features such as location, population, and
   land use types. The second step of the encoder designs a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to achieve the fusion of neighborhood features,
   constructs a spatial interaction network with the grids as nodes and the
   flows as edges, and then uses the graph convolutional network (GCN) to
   extract the embeddings of the nodes. In the last step of the decoder, a
   random forest regressor is trained to predict the commuting flow based
   on the learned embedding vectors. An empirical study on a commuter
   dataset in Beijing shows that our proposed model is approximately 20%
   better than XGBoost (state-of-the-art), thus proving its effectiveness.

AB As one of the most important operation and maintenance approaches,
   health state diagnosis technology plays a crucial role in ensuring the
   safety and reliability of mechanical equipment. The planar parallel
   manipulator, as a typical actuator, is widely employed in the field of
   precision manufacturing due to its advantages of high stiffness, large
   load support capability, and high precision. However, compared with
   common key functional components (such as bearings and gearboxes),
   planar parallel manipulators have more complicated operating mechanisms
   and failure behaviors. To satisfy the health state diagnosis demands of
   planar parallel manipulators in the scenario of insufficient label
   information, a novel intelligent health state diagnosis approach, termed
   semi-supervised graph-guided network with perception attention (SGN-PA),
   is developed for a 3-PRR (P and R represent prismatic and revolute
   pairs, respectively) planar parallel manipulator. Specifically, an
   improved multiorder graph perception module is constructed to extract
   multiscale feature information, and achieve feature fusion by combining
   perceptual attention mechanism, which enables the proposed SGN-PA model
   to have adaptation adjustment capabilities. Following that, local and
   nonlocal feature constraint strategies are employed with pseudo-label
   technology to reduce intraclass differences and maximize interclass
   differences, and then to fit the demands of health state diagnosis
   tasks. Eventually, based on the simulation and experimental scenarios of
   a 3-PRR planar parallel manipulator, the effectiveness and feasibility
   of the proposed SGN-PA model is extensively confirmed, and the diagnosis
   results show that it can significantly relax the constraints of label
   information while maintaining superior performances.

AB Cross-modal image-text matching has attracted considerable interest in
   both computer vision and natural language processing communities. The
   main issue of image-text matching is to learn the compact cross-modal
   representations and the correlation between image and text
   representations. However, the image-text matching task has two major
   challenges. First, the current image representation methods focus on the
   semantic information and disregard the spatial position relations
   between image regions. Second, most existing methods pay little
   attention to improving textual representation which plays a significant
   role in image-text matching. To address these issues, we designed a
   decipherable cross-modal multi-relationship aware reasoning network
   (CMRN) for image-text matching. In particular, a new method is proposed
   to extract multi-relationship and to learn the correlations between
   image regions, including two kinds of visual relations: the geometric
   position relation and semantic interaction. In addition, images are
   processed as graphs, and a novel spatial relation encoder is introduced
   to perform reasoning on the graphs by employing a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) with attention mechanism. Thereafter, a contextual text
   encoder based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
   is adopted to learn distinctive textual representations. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed model, extensive experiments were
   conducted on two public datasets, namely MSCOCO and Flickr30K. The
   experimental results show that CMRN achieved superior performance when
   compared with state-of-the-art methods. On Flickr30K, the proposed
   method outperforms state-of-the-art methods more than 7.4% in text
   retrieval from image query, and 5.0% relatively in image retrieval with
   text query (based on Recall@1). On MSCOCO, the performance reaches 73.9%
   for text retrieval and 60.4% for image retrieval (based on Recall@1).

AB Malicious social robots are the disseminators of malicious information
   on social networks, which seriously affect information security and
   network environments. Efficient and reliable classification of social
   robots is crucial for detecting information manipulation in social
   networks. Supervised classification based on manual feature extraction
   has been widely used in social robot detection. However, these methods
   not only involve the privacy of users but also ignore hidden feature
   information, especially the graph feature, and the label utilization
   rate of semi-supervised algorithms is low. Aiming at the problems of
   shallow feature extraction and low label utilization rate in existing
   social network robot detection methods, in this paper a robot detection
   scheme based on weighted network topology is proposed, which introduces
   an improved network representation learning algorithm to extract the
   local structure features of the network, and combined with the graph
   convolution network (GCN) algorithm based on the graph filter, to obtain
   the global structure features of the network. An end-to-end
   semi-supervised combination model (Semi-GSGCN) is established to detect
   malicious social robots. Experiments on a social network dataset
   (cresci-rtbust-2019) show that the proposed method has high versatility
   and effectiveness in detecting social robots. In addition, this method
   has a stronger insight into robots in social networks than other
   methods.

AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become popular structures for unifying
   real-world entities by modelling the relationships between them and
   their attributes. To support multilingual applications, a significant
   number of language-specific KGs have been built by different parties
   using various data sources. As a result, these monolingual KGs are often
   disconnected, causing semantic heterogeneity and detracting from the
   original purpose of KGs. Entity alignment - the task of identifying
   corresponding entities across different KGs - has attracted a great deal
   of attention in both academia and industry. However, existing alignment
   techniques often require large amounts of labelled data, are unable to
   encode multi-modal data simultaneously, and enforce only a few
   consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end,
   unsupervised entity alignment framework for cross-lingual KGs that fuses
   different types of information in order to fully exploit the richness of
   KG data. The model captures the relation-based correlation between
   entities by using a multi-order graph convolutional neural (GCN) model
   that is designed to satisfy the consistency constraints, while
   incorporating the attribute-based correlation via a translation machine.
   We adopt a late-fusion mechanism to combine all the information
   together, which allows these approaches to complement each other and
   thus enhances the final alignment result, and makes the model more
   robust to consistency violations. Empirical results for various
   scenarios on real-world and synthetic KGs show that our model is up to
   22.71 percent more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than existing
   baselines. We also demonstrate its sensitivity to hyper-parameters,
   effort saving in terms of labelling, and the robustness against
   adversarial conditions.

AB The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies leads to a wide
   penetration and large-scale deployment of IoT systems across an entire
   city or even country. While IoT systems are capable of providing
   intelligent services, the large amount of data collected and processed
   in IoT systems also raises serious security concerns. Many research
   efforts have been devoted to design intelligent network intrusion
   detection system (NIDS) to prevent misuse of IoT data across smart
   applications. However, existing approaches may suffer from the issue of
   limited and imbalanced attack data when training the detection model,
   which make the system vulnerable especially for those unknown type
   attacks. In this study, a novel hierarchical adversarial attack (HAA)
   generation method is introduced to realize the level-aware black-box
   adversarial attack strategy, targeting the graph neural network
   (GNN)-based intrusion detection in IoT systems with a limited budget. By
   constructing a shadow GNN model, an intelligent mechanism based on a
   saliency map technique is designed to generate adversarial examples by
   effectively identifying and modifying the critical feature elements with
   minimal perturbations. A hierarchical node selection algorithm based on
   random walk with restart (RWR) is developed to select a set of more
   vulnerable nodes with high attack priority, considering their structural
   features, and overall loss changes within the targeted IoT network. The
   proposed HAA generation method is evaluated using the open-source data
   set UNSW-SOSR2019 with three baseline methods. Comparison results
   demonstrate its ability in degrading the classification precision by
   more than 30% in the two state-of-the-art GNN models, GCN and JK-Net,
   respectively, for NIDS in IoT environments.

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) nowadays become new state-of-the-art
   for networks representation learning. Most of the existing methods are
   single-granular methods that failed to analyze the graph at
   multi-granular views so as to lose abundant information. Advanced graph
   pooling techniques can be successfully benefiting from semi-supervised
   networks representation learning. How to capture multi-granular
   information through the graph pooling techniques on graphs without
   additional input features is a great challenge. Technically speaking, we
   propose our graph node embeddings framework, MGPOOL. First, inspired by
   the triadic influence learning, we use the 3-clique algorithm to coarsen
   the graph repeatedly. Three nodes of a triangle form a supernode. We
   treat the supernodes as key nodes for our graph pooling operations. That
   keeps the local relationship. These graphs capture consecutive 3-cliques
   from the finest to the coarsest to preserve global structural
   relationships. Second, we use the unsupervised single-granular
   algorithms on the coarsest graph to acquire its node embeddings. Based
   on that, our graph pooling operations combining with that node
   embeddings to generate another same size of the coarsest graph. This
   makes up for the uniqueness of the coarsening result at a time and
   expands the receptive field for each node to avoid high-proximity
   information lost. Third, we take the embeddings, the coarsest graph and
   new coarsest graph as uniform input of MGPOOL. We restore the coarsest
   graph to the original graph to get the original graph node embeddings.
   The experimental results on four public datasets, Wiki, Cora, CiteSeer,
   and DBLP, demonstrate that our method has a better Macro F1 value for
   node classification tasks and AUC and Ap value for link prediction than
   the baseline methods.

AB Bike-sharing systems have been prevalent since their appearance. As a
   way to solve the difficulty of the last mile, it can reduce greenhouse
   gas production. In a bike-sharing system, users can pick up bikes at
   nearby stations and return them to the stations near their destinations,
   that provides convenience for users. However, the number of bikes rented
   from or returned to stations changes over time, causing an imbalance in
   the number of bikes, and leading to both users? and operators? problems.
   Bikes flow inequality will lead to inefficient use of bike, and waste
   users? time when the target station has no dock, or the departure
   station has no bikes. Bike check-out/in flow prediction is a crucial
   research and practical issue in bikesharing systems, which plays a vital
   role in bike rebalancing There are three main research ideas in current
   studies, and the first is clustering-level flow prediction. i.e., all
   stations are
   Nowadays, bike-sharing is available in many cities, solving the problem
   of the last mile, and it is an environmental-friendly way to commute.
   However, there is a tidal phenomenon in the bike-sharing system, and the
   rents/returns of bikes at different stations are unbalanced. Thus, bikes
   at different stations need to be rebalanced regularly and station-level
   demand prediction plays an essential role in bike-sharing rebalancing.
   In this paper, a novel deep graph convolutional network (GCN) model with
   temporal attention (TAGCN) is proposed for bike check-out/in number
   prediction of each station. TAGCN can not only model the spatial and
   temporal dependency between varying stations, but also reflect the
   influence of different time granularity, which are hour-level, day-level
   and week-level time periodicity. With the help of well-designed temporal
   attention mechanism, our model can capture the dynamical temporal
   correlations and comprehensive spatial patterns in bike check-out/in
   flow effectively. The proposed model consistently outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods on four real-world bike-sharing datasets that
   are four seasons data of Divvy Bike System in Chicago.

AB Traffic data missing issues due to unpredictable equipment failure,
   extreme weather, and other reasons have brought great challenges to
   traffic flow prediction modeling. In this paper, a novel reinforced
   dynamic graph convolutional network model is proposed to simultaneously
   conduct data imputation and network-wide traffic flow prediction. First,
   a multi-graph convolutional fusion network is proposed for data
   imputation by using the graph convolutional network to analyze the
   propagation law of traffic states between traffic flow detection
   stations in both time and space dimensions. Second, to enhance the
   robustness of network-wide traffic flow prediction, a dynamic graph
   learning method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to
   adaptively generate the graph adjacency matrix to represent the dynamic
   spatiotemporal dependencies be-tween the stations. Finally, experimental
   results on two real-world traffic datasets show that the proposed method
   outperforms other baseline methods and can effectively extract the data
   missing features and spatiotemporal dependence features between the
   stations. The visualization results of the graph adjacency matrix
   indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify the
   influential traffic stations in the process of traffic flow prediction,
   and the extracted dependencies between the stations are interpretable.
   The proposed model has strong generalization in tackling network-wide
   traffic flow prediction tasks with different data missing rates and
   missing patterns, and can be extended to assist decision-makers in
   enhancing traffic management and mitigating traffic congestion.

AB In this paper, we seek to solve the problem of video anomaly detection
   under the weakly-supervised setting. Different from previous works that
   usually deal with the problem in a multiple-instance learning manner, we
   formulate it as a fully-supervised learning task with label noises.
   Under this new perspective, we can fully leverage the advantages of
   well-designed action classifiers for anomaly detection as long as the
   label noises are cleaned. For this purpose, we devise a graph
   convolutional network for label noise cleaning, which integrates two
   crucial characteristics for anomaly analysis: feature similarity and
   temporal consistency. Supervised by both direct and indirect signals,
   the net propagates supervision information from high-confidence snippets
   to low-confidence ones and provides cleaned labels for action classifier
   training. In this way, we design an alternate learning strategy to
   progressively promote the discrimination of the action classifier.
   During the test phase, we directly utilize the learned action classifier
   for anomaly detection in an end-to-end fashion without any intermediate
   processing. We have conducted extensive experiments on various anomaly
   datasets of three scales with two main types of action classifiers, and
   achieved superior or comparable performances compared with
   state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we manually annotate the temporal
   duration of anomalies in the training data of UCFCrime, and give out the
   upper-limit performance of our cleaner net. The annotation can also be
   used as the ground truth for studying anomaly detection models under
   multi-level supervisory signals, which will mitigate the present
   shortage of large-scale anomaly datasets. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All

AB An image is the abstraction of a thousand words. The meaning and essence
   of complex topics, ideas, and concepts can be easily and effectively
   conveyed visually by a single image rather than a lengthy verbal
   description. It is not only essential to teach computers how to
   recognize and classify images but also how to generate them. Controlled
   image generation depicting complex and multiple objects is a challenging
   task in computer vision despite the significant advancements in
   generative modeling. Among the core challenges, scene graph-based and
   scene layout-based image generation is a significant problem in computer
   vision and requires generative models to reason about object
   relationships and compositionality. Due to its ease of use, less time
   cost, and labor needs, image generation/synthesizing models from scene
   graphs and layouts are proliferating. In the case of a more significant
   number of scene graphs and layout to image generation models, a unique
   experimental evaluation methodology is required to evaluate the
   controlled image generation. To this extent, we, in this work, present a
   standard methodology to evaluate the performance of scene graph and
   scene layout-based image generation models. We perform a comparative
   analysis of image generation models to evaluate image generation models'
   complexity from scene graphs and scene layouts. We analyze the different
   components of these models on Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets. The
   experimental results show that the scene layout-based image generation
   outperforms its graph-based counterpart in most quantitative and
   qualitative evaluations. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by

AB Knowledge services are becoming a rising star in the family of XaaS
   (Everything as a Service). In recent years, people are more willing to
   search for answers and share their knowledge directly over the Internet,
   which drives the knowledge service ecosystem prosperous and quickly
   evolve. In this article, we aim to predict the popularity of knowledge
   services, which will benefit the downstream industries that provide
   Knowledge as a Service (KaaS). Toward such a task, the spatial
   interactions (e.g., hyperlinks in Wikipedia) and temporal observations
   (e.g., page views) provide crucial information. However, it is difficult
   to utilize this information due to: (i) complicated and different usage
   observations, (ii) intricate and evolutionary spatial interactions, and
   (iii) small world trait of the network. To tackle such issues, we
   propose Evolutionary Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks
   (E-GCRNNs) to simultaneously model both temporal and spatial
   dependencies of knowledge services from their evolving networks.
   Specifically, an elementary unit (called E-GCGRU) is designed to
   dynamically perceive the evolutionary spatial dependencies, aggregate
   spatial information of knowledge services, and model the temporal
   patterns by considering the records of one sequence and its neighbors
   simultaneously. Additionally, a localized mini-batch training scheme is
   developed, which allows the E-GCRNNs to work on large-scale knowledge
   services networks and reduce the prediction bias caused by the small
   world trait. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have
   demonstrated that the proposed E-GCRNNs outperform baselines in terms of
   prediction accuracy, especially with the prediction range being longer,
   while remaining computationally efficient.

AB Point cloud upsampling can improve the resolutions of point clouds and
   maintain the forms of point clouds, which has attracted more and more
   attention in recent years. However, upsampling networks sometimes
   generate point clouds with unclear contours and deficient topological
   structures, i.e., the problem of insufficient form fidelity of upsampled
   point clouds. This paper focuses on the above problem. Firstly, we
   manage to find the points located at contours or sparse positions of
   point clouds, i.e., the form describers, and make them multiply
   correctly. To this end, 3 statistics of points, i.e., local coordinate
   difference, local normal difference and describing index, are designed
   to estimate the form describers of the point clouds and rectify the
   feature aggregation of them with reliable neighboring features.
   Secondly, we divide points into disjoint levels according to the above
   statistics and apply K nearest neighbors algorithm to the points of
   different levels respectively to build an accurate graph. Finally,
   cascaded networks and graph information are fused and added to the
   feature aggregation so that the network can learn the topology of
   objects deeply, enhancing the perception of model toward graph
   information. Our upsampling model PU-FPG is obtained by combining these
   3 parts with upsampling networks. We conduct abundant experiments on
   PU1K dataset and Semantic3D dataset, comparing the upsampling effects of
   PU-FPG and previous works in multiple metrics. Compared with the
   baseline model, the Chamfer distance, the Hausdorff distance and the
   point-to-surface distance of PU-FPG are reduced by 0.159 x 10(-3), 2.892
   x 10(-3) and 0.852 x 10(-3), respectively. This shows that PU-FPG can
   improve the form fidelity and raise the quality of upsampled point
   clouds effectively. Our code is publicly available at

   opinion spans from a word-level or phrase-level perspective. Based on
   the observation that targets and sentiments essentially establish
   relations following the grammatical hierarchy of phrase-clause-sentence
   structure, it is hopeful to exploit comprehensive syntactic informa-tion
   for better guiding the learning process. Therefore, we introduce the
   concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related to a
   specific target. To jointly learn structural Scope and predict the
   sen-timent polarity, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network
   (HGCN) to synthesize information from constituency tree and dependency
   tree, exploring the potential of linking two syntax parsing meth-ods to
   enrich the representation. Experimental results on five public datasets
   illustrate that our HGCN model outperforms current state-of-the-art
   baselines. More specifically, the average accuracy/ F1 score
   improvements of our HGCN compared to baseline models on Restaurant 14,
   15 and 16 are 2.46%/5.36%, 2.25%/5.70% and 1.73%/5.50%, while the
   performance improvements are 3.32%/4.30% and 2.50%/3.08% on the Laptop
   and Twitter datasets, respectively. Furthermore, when cascaded to five
   mod-els, our method has significantly improved their performances by
   simplifying the sentence from multiple targets to a single one. (c) 2022

AB Graph deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful ML concept
   allowing to generalize successful deep neural architectures to
   non-euclidean structured data. Such methods have shown promising results
   on a broad spectrum of applications ranging from social science,
   biomedicine, and particle physics to computer vision, graphics, and
   chemistry. One of the limitations of the majority of current graph
   neural network architectures is that they are often restricted to the
   transductive setting and rely on the assumption that the underlying
   graph is known and fixed. Often, this assumption is not true since the
   graph may be noisy, or partially and even completely unknown. In such
   cases, it would be helpful to infer the graph directly from the data,
   especially in inductive settings where some nodes were not present in
   the graph at training time. Furthermore, learning a graph may become an
   end in itself, as the inferred structure may provide complementary
   insights next to the downstream task. In this paper, we introduce
   Differentiable Graph Module (DGM), a learnable function that predicts
   edge probabilities in the graph which are optimal for the downstream
   task. DGM can be combined with convolutional graph neural network layers
   and trained in an end-to-end fashion. We provide an extensive evaluation
   of applications from the domains of healthcare (disease prediction),
   brain imaging (age prediction), computer graphics (3D point cloud
   segmentation), and computer vision (zero-shot learning). We show that
   our model provides a significant improvement over baselines both in
   transductive and inductive settings and achieves state-of-the-art
   results.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an important area in computer
   vision, with wide applications in au-tonomous driving, robot path
   planning, and surveillance systems. The core underlying technique of
   these applications is pattern recognition. A key challenge in this area
   is modeling social interactions between pedestrians, such as pedestrian
   view area and group behaviors. However, although many methods have been
   proposed to model social interactions, pedestrian view area and group
   behaviors have not been ex-plored together to account for complex
   situations. Additionally, most existing studies require additional
   detectors and manual annotations to handle view area and group
   interactions, respectively. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch
   spatio-temporal graph neural network to automatically model view area
   and grouping together. Specifically, a spatio-temporal graph attention
   network (STGAT) branch is designed to handle pedestrian view area, and a
   spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) branch is de-signed
   to model group interactions. The features of these branches are then
   fused to provide better fea-ture representations, on which a temporal
   convolution operation (TCN) is performed for trajectory pre-diction.
   Experiments on public standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed
   method achieves very competitive performance and predicts socially
   acceptable trajectories in different challenging scenarios. & COPY; 2023

AB The hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to assign each pixel
   to a land-cover category. It is receiving increasing attention from both
   industry and academia. The main challenge lies in capturing reliable and
   informative spatial and spectral dependencies concealed in the HSI for
   each class. To address the challenge, we propose a spatial-spectral
   1DSwin (SS1DSwin) Transformer with groupwise feature tokenization for
   HSI classification. Specifically, we reveal local and hierarchical
   spatial-spectral relationships from two different perspectives. It
   mainly consists of a groupwise feature tokenization module (GFTM) and a
   1DSwin Transformer with cross-block normalized connection module
   (TCNCM). For GFTM, we reorganize an image patch into overlapping cubes
   and further generate groupwise token embeddings with multihead
   self-attention (MSA) to learn the local spatial-spectral relationship
   along the spatial dimension. For TCNCM, we adopt the shifted windowing
   strategy when acquiring the hierarchical spatial-spectral relationship
   along the spectral dimension with 1-D window-based MSA (1DW-MSA) and 1-D
   shifted window-based MSA (1DSW-MSA) and leverage cross-block normalized
   connection (CNC) to adaptively fuse the feature maps from different
   blocks. In SS1DSwin, we apply these two modules in order and predict the
   class label for each pixel. To test the effectiveness of the proposed
   method, extensive experiments are conducted on four HSI datasets, and
   the results indicate that SS1DSwin outperforms several current
   state-of-the-art methods. The source code of the proposed method is
   available at https://github.com/Minato252/SS1DSwin.

AB Recently, visible and infrared thermal (RGB-T) images have drawn wide
   publicity for vehicle fusion detection in traffic monitoring because of
   their strong complementarities. How to fully use RGB-T images for
   vehicle fusion detection has generated enormous publicity. However, the
   infrared thermal dataset is relatively insufficient. Moreover, the most
   important requirements of vehicle fusion detection are accuracy, fast
   speed, and flexibility. Therefore, to address these difficulties, we
   propose a concise and flexible vehicle fusion detection method in RGB-T
   images via spare network and dynamic weight coefficient-based
   Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. It combines the detection results
   of RGB-T images based on a decision-level vehicle fusion strategy. In
   this work, we focus on vehicle detection using infrared thermal images
   and the vehicle fusion detection strategy. For the former, we construct
   an applicable network for vehicle detection in infrared thermal images
   with sparse parameters (weights) and high generalization ability. For
   the latter, a fusion strategy via dynamic weight coefficient-based D-S
   evidence theory is proposed to fuse the two detection results of the
   RGB-T images. In the vehicle fusion detection strategy, we do not
   directly fuse the two detection results but judge the detection accuracy
   in advance. Finally, we introduce the VIVID, VOT2019, and RGBT234
   datasets to verify the proposed vehicle fusion detection method. The
   vehicle fusion detection results show that the proposed method presents
   superior results compared with several mainstream approaches. (C) 2022

AB Accurate traffic prediction is a critical yet challenging task in
   Intelligent Transportation Systems, benefiting a variety of smart
   services, e.g., route planning and traffic management. Although
   extensive efforts have been devoted to this problem, it is still not
   well solved due to the flexible dependency within traffic data along
   both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we explore the
   flexibility from three aspects, namely the time-varying local spatial
   dependency, the dynamic temporal dependency, and the global spatial
   dependency. Then we propose a novel Dual Graph Gated Recurrent Neural
   Network (DG(2)RNN) to effectively model all these dependencies and offer
   flexible (multi-step) predictions for future traffic flow. Specifically,
   we design a Dual Graph Convolution Module to capture the local spatial
   dependency from two perspectives, namely road distance and adaptive
   correlation. To model the dynamic temporal dependency, we firstly
   develop a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Layer to capture the forward and
   backward sequential contexts of historical traffic flow, then combine
   the derived hidden states with their various contributions learned by a
   temporal attention mechanism. Besides, we further design a spatial
   attention mechanism to learn the latent global spatial dependency among
   all locations to facilitate the prediction. Extensive experiments on
   three types of real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our model
   outperforms state-of-the-arts. Results also show our model has more
   stable performance for the flexible prediction with varying prediction
   horizons.

AB Aspect Level Sentiment Classification (ALSC) deals with classifying the
   sentiment polarity towards a particular aspect or target. The
   performance of any method in ALSC is primarily driven by its capability
   to map the aspect or target term to the correct sentiment context words.
   The dependency tree's syntactical information is crucial for correctly
   mapping the appropriate context terms to the aspect term. Thus, recent
   top-performing methods use the graph neural network (GNN) to incorporate
   the syntactical knowledge of the dependency tree. However, the
   architecture of such methods is quite complex with the computationally
   expensive GNNs. In this work, we propose a method syntactic
   neighbour-based attention network (SNBAN), that is architecturally
   simple, takes less computational time and is efficient. SNBAN has a
   novel and simple architecture that is based on Bi-GRU (Bi-directional
   Gated Recurrent unit). Specifically, SNBAN can exploit both semantic and
   syntactic knowledge of the input sentence using two muti-head attentions
   (MHATT) where the first and second MHATT handle the semantic and
   syntactic knowledge of the input sentence respectively. The experiments
   show that the proposed SNBAN significantly outperforms the non-syntactic
   knowledge-based baselines. The experiments also show that the proposed
   SNBAN takes a significantly reduced average training time in comparison
   to GNNs and at the same time performs with comparable accuracy and F1
   score against the GNN based methods. & COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published

AB The use of face masks has become a widespread non-pharmaceutical
   practice to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. However, achieving
   accurate facial detection while people wear masks or similar face
   occlusions is a major challenge. This paper introduces a model to detect
   occluded or masked faces based on fused convolutional graphs. This model
   includes a deep neural architecture with two spatial-based graphs that
   rely on a set of key facial features. First, a distance graph is used to
   identify geographical similarity between the facial nodes that represent
   certain key face parts. Second, a correlation graph is formulated to
   compute the correlations between every two nodes that represent two
   different augmented facial modalities. Transfer learning is then
   performed using a pretrained deep architecture as a baseline to map the
   abstract semantic information into multiple feature filters. Then,
   discriminant graph convolutions are constructed based on the fusion of
   distance and correlation graphs. This model evaluates two tasks of
   facial detection, which are the binary detection of masked or unmasked
   faces, and multi-category detection of masked, unmasked, or occluded
   face with no mask. The experimental results on two benchmarking
   real-world datasets show that the proposed deep learning model is highly
   effective with an accuracy of 98% achieved in binary detection. Even
   with high variance in image occlusions, our proposed model has great
   promise in detecting and distinguishing between types of facial
   occlusion with an accuracy of 86% reported in multi-category detection.

AB APS is the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with
   thromboses and/or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Among patients with
   SLE, one-third have aPL and 10-15% have a manifestation of secondary
   APS. Animal studies suggested that complement activation plays an
   important role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and pregnancy loss in
   APS. We performed a cross-sectional study on complement proteins and
   genes in 525 patients with aPL. Among them, 237 experienced thromboses
   and 293 had SLE; 111 had both SLE and thromboses, and 106 had neither
   SLE nor thrombosis. Complement protein levels were determined by radial
   immunodiffusion for C4, C3 and factor H; and by functional ELISA for
   mannan binding lectin (MBL). Total C4, C4A and C4B gene copy numbers
   (GCN) were measured by TaqMan-based realtime PCR. Two to six copies of
   C4 genes are frequently present in a diploid genome, and each copy may
   code for an acidic C4A or a basic C4B protein. We observed significantly
   (a) higher protein levels of total C4, C4A, C4B, C3, and anticardiolipin
   (ACLA) IgG, (b) increased frequencies of lupus anticoagulant and males,
   and (c) decreased levels of complement factor H, MBL and ACLA-IgM among
   patients with thrombosis than those without thrombosis (N = 288). We
   also observed significantly lower GCNs of total C4 and C4A among
   aPL-positive patients with both SLE and thrombosis than others. By
   contrast, aPL-positive subjects with SLE had significantly reduced
   protein levels of C3, total C4, C4A, C4B and ACLA-IgG, and higher
   frequency of females than those without SLE. Patients with thrombosis
   but without SLE (N = 126), and patients with SLE but without thrombosis
   (N = 182) had the greatest differences in mean protein levels of C3 (p =
   2.6 x 10(-6)), C4 (p = 2.2 x 10(-9)) and ACLA-IgG (p = 1.2 x 10(-5)).
   RPL occurred in 23.7% of female patients and thrombotic SLE patients had
   the highest frequency of RPL (41.0%; p = 3.8 x 10(-1)0). Compared with
   non-RPL females, RPL had significantly higher frequency of thrombosis
   and elevated C4 protein levels. Female patients with homozygous C4A
   deficiency all experienced RPL (p = 0.0001) but the opposite was true
   for patients with homozygous C4B deficiency (p = 0.017). These results
   provide new insights and biomarkers for diagnosis and management of APS
   and SLE.

AB Hetero-structured nanocomposite consisting of graphitic carbon nitride
   host, decorated by gamma-phase iron oxide, maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3@G-CN)
   was synthesized in different mass contents of gamma-Fe2O3 & nbsp;(5%,
   10% and 20%) in the composite, by the method of nanosecond pulsed laser
   fragmentation, and defect engineering in liquid for the removal of
   hazardous organic pollutants from aqueous solutions. The elemental,
   structural, and morphological characterizations of the synthesized
   nanocomposites by XPS, XRD, TEM, and HR-TEM exhibited the proper
   anchoring of gamma-Fe2O3 on the graphitic carbon nitride polymeric
   network. Also, the diffuse reflectance spectra, and the room temperature
   photoluminescence spectra respectively revealed that the presence of
   gamma-Fe2O3 & nbsp;in graphitic carbon nitride brought about the
   enhanced and extended visible light absorption, and reduced
   recombination of photo induced electron hole pairs, the characteristics
   desired in a good photo-catalyst. Moreover, this composite material
   exhibited the z-scheme photo catalytic mechanism, where the more
   energetic electrons and holes in the composite band structure mediate
   the redox reaction in the photo-catalysis. The photo-catalytic
   efficiency of gamma-Fe2O3@G-CN nanocomposite was evaluated in the
   photo-catalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB), and rhodamine-B (Rh-B)
   cationic dyes under visible light irradiations. For both the degradation
   processes, all the variants of gamma-Fe2O3@G-CN nanocomposite
   consistently showed the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency with respect
   to pure GCN, with the maximum efficiency recorded for 10% gamma-Fe2O3 in
   gamma-Fe2O3@G-CN nanocomposite.

AB Photocatalysis has fascinated wide consideration due to its promising
   advantage in wastewater treatment. And the metal-oxides and g-C3N4 that
   possess Z-scheme heterojunctions have become the energetic
   photocatalysts (PCs) in degrading the organic impurities. In this work,
   a novel magnetic separable g-C3N4/-Fe2O3 (GFE) nanocomposites (NCs) were
   fabricated by a facile hydrothermal strategy. Structural, morphological,
   optical, surface area and magnetic belongings of GFE composites were
   effectively explored using XRD, FT-IR, XPS, FESEM, HRTEM with EDX
   mapping, BET, UV-DRS and PL spectra. The (g-C3N4/20 wt % alpha-Fe2O3)
   GFE2 com-posite PCs were verified robust with significantly upgraded the
   photocatalytic efficiency for (anionic) RhB (97.2%) and (cationic) MB
   (90.6%) mixed aqueous organic pollutants degradation in 150 min under
   visible-light exposure, which was favourably higher than to GCN (65.2%)
   and alpha-Fe2O3 (16.6%) PCs. Moreover, the as-obtained GFE composite PCs
   also exposed great stability after five successive recyclabilities. The
   enhanced photo-degradation activity was largely ascribed to the extended
   visible-light fascination ability, high surface area, augmented active
   sites and strong redox ability relatively. Also, the energetic formation
   of alpha-Fe2O3 coupled g-C3N4 heterojunction that skilled the probable
   recombination rate and beneficial for the separation of photo-excited
   electron and hole (e(-)/h(+)) pairs based on active "Z-scheme "
   mechanism was liable for eliminating organic mixed pollutants.

AB An energy management strategy is a key technology used to exploit the
   energy-saving potential of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. This paper
   proposes the environmental perceiver-based equivalent consumption
   minimization strategy (EP-ECMS) for parallel plug-in hybrid vehicles. In
   this method, the traffic characteristic information obtained from the
   intelligent traffic system is used to guide the adjustment of the
   equivalence factor, improving the environmental adaptiveness of the
   equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). Two main works have
   been completed. First, a high-accuracy environmental perceiver was
   developed based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) and attention
   mechanism to complete the traffic state recognition of all graph regions
   based on historical information. Moreover, it provides the grade of the
   corresponding region where the vehicle is located (for the ECMS).
   Secondly, in the offline process, the search for the optimal equivalent
   factor is completed by using the Harris hawk optimization algorithm
   based on the representative working conditions under various grades.
   Based on the identified traffic grades in the online process, the
   optimized equivalence factor tables are checked for energy management
   control. The simulation results show that the improved EP-ECMS can
   achieve 7.25% energy consumption optimization compared with the
   traditional ECMS.

AB Accurate traffic status prediction is of great importance to improve the
   security and reliability of the intelligent transportation system.
   However, urban traffic status prediction is a very challenging task due
   to the tight symmetry among the Human-Vehicle-Environment (HVE). The
   recently proposed spatial-temporal 3D convolutional neural network
   (ST-3DNet) effectively extracts both spatial and temporal
   characteristics in HVE, but ignores the essential long-term temporal
   characteristics and the symmetry of historical data. Therefore, a novel
   spatial-temporal 3D residual correlation network (ST-3DRCN) is proposed
   for urban traffic status prediction in this paper. The ST-3DRCN firstly
   introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient method to extract a high
   correlation between traffic data. Then, a dynamic spatial feature
   extraction component is constructed by using 3D convolution combined
   with residual units to capture dynamic spatial features. After that,
   based on the idea of long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel
   architectural unit is proposed to extract dynamic temporal features.
   Finally, the spatial and temporal features are fused to obtain the final
   prediction results. Experiments have been performed using two datasets
   from Chengdu, China (TaxiCD) and California, USA (PEMS-BAY). Taking the
   root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index, the prediction
   accuracy of ST-3DRCN on TaxiCD dataset is 21.4%, 21.3%, 11.7%, 10.8%,
   4.7%, 3.6% and 2.3% higher than LSTM, convolutional neural network
   (CNN), 3D-CNN, spatial-temporal residual network (ST-ResNet),
   spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), dynamic
   global-local spatial-temporal network (DGLSTNet), and ST-3DNet,
   respectively.

AB Recently, the deep learning models have achieved great success in the
   recognition of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images. However,
   most of the deep learning models fail to obtain satisfactory results
   under the condition of small samples due to the contradiction between
   the large parameter space of the deep learning models and the
   insufficient labeled samples of space target imaging by ISAR. In this
   article, a method of meta-learner-based stacking network (MSN) is
   proposed, which can realize the high-precision classification of space
   target by ISAR images under the condition of small sample. Innovatively,
   a rotation-invariant attention mechanism (RAM) module is added into
   Resnet50 network to magnify the difference of embedded features of
   target and background. Complementarily, the deep relationship between
   the features of fine-grained ISAR image is extracted by using graph
   convolutional network and relation network. Finally, an innovative
   adaptive weighted XGBoost algorithm is used to integrate the prediction
   results of the base learners. The main contributions of this article
   include proposing a RAM module and using an innovative adaptive weighted
   XGBoost algorithm to realize ensemble learning. The experiment results
   show that the RAM module effectively concentrates the network's
   attention on the recognized target, and the recognition rate of MSN is
   about 5% higher than that of a single base learner under different data
   volume conditions, which proves that MSN achieves competitive accuracy
   against other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo functional deterioration with
   increasing age that causes loss of their self-renewal and regenerative
   potential. Despite various efforts, significant success in identifying
   molecular regulators of HSC aging has not been achieved, one prime
   reason being the non-availability of appropriate human HSC samples. To
   demonstrate the scope of integrating and re-analyzing the HSC
   transcriptomics data available, we used existing tools and databases to
   structure a sequential data analysis pipeline to predict potential
   candidate genes, transcription factors, and microRNAs simultaneously.
   This sequential approach comprises (i) collecting matched young and aged
   mice HSC sample datasets, (ii) identifying differentially expressed
   genes, (iii) identifying human homologs of differentially expressed
   genes, (iv) inferring gene co-expression network modules, and (v)
   inferring the microRNA-transcription factor-gene regulatory network.
   Systems-level analyses of HSC interaction networks provided various
   insights based on which several candidates were predicted. For example,
   16 HSC aging-related candidate genes were predicted (e.g., CD38, BRCA1,
   AGTR1, GSTM1, etc.) from GCN analysis. Following this, the shortest path
   distance-based analyses of the regulatory network predicted several
   novel candidate miRNAs and TFs. Among these, miR-124-3p was a common
   regulator in candidate gene modules, while TFs MYC and SP1 were
   identified to regulate various candidate genes. Based on the regulatory
   interactions among candidate genes, TFs, and miRNAs, a potential
   regulation model of biological processes in each of the candidate
   modules was predicted, which provided systems-level insights into the
   molecular complexity of each module to regulate HSC aging.

AB IoT sensor networks have an inherent graph structure that can be used to
   extract graphical features for improving performance in a variety of
   prediction tasks. We propose a framework that represents IoT sensor
   network data as a graph, extracts graphical features, and applies
   feature selection methods to identify the most useful features that are
   to be used by a classifier for prediction tasks. We show that a set of
   generic graph-based features can improve performance of sensor network
   predictions without the need for application-specific and task-specific
   feature engineering. We apply this approach to three different
   prediction tasks: activity recognition from motion sensors in a smart
   home, demographic prediction from GPS sensor data in a smart phone, and
   activity recognition from GPS sensor data in a smart phone. Our approach
   produced comparable results with most of the state-of-the-art methods,
   while maintaining the additional advantage of general applicability to
   IoT sensor networks without using sophisticated and application-specific
   feature generation techniques or background knowledge. We further
   investigate the impact of using edge-transition times, categorical
   features, different sensor window sizes, and normalization in the smart
   home domain. We also consider deep learning approaches, including the
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), for the elimination of feature
   engineering in the smart home domain, but our approach provided better
   performance in most cases. We conclude that the graphical feature-based
   framework that is based on IoT sensor categorization, nodes and edges as
   features, and feature selection techniques provides superior results
   when compared to the non-graph-based features.

AB Background and Objective: For early identification of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) based on multi-modal mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI)
   data, it is important to make comprehensive use of image features and
   non-image information to analyze the gray matter atrophy and the
   structural/functional connectivity ab-normalities for different courses
   of AD.Methods: In this study, we propose an extensible hierarchical
   graph convolutional network (EH-GCN) for early AD identification. Based
   on the extracted image features from multi-modal MRI data using the
   pre-sented multi-branch residual network (ResNet), the brain
   regions-of-interests (ROIs) based GCN is built to extract structural and
   functional connectivity features between different ROIs of the brain. In
   order to further improve the performance of AD identification, an
   optimized spatial GCN is proposed as convolu-tion operator in the
   population-based GCN to avoid rebuilding the graph network and take
   advantage of relationships between subjects. Finally, the proposed
   EH-GCN is built by embedding the image features and internal brain
   connectivity features into the spatial population-based GCN, which
   provides an ex-tensible way to improve early AD identification
   performance by adding imaging features and non-image information from
   multi-modal data.Results: Experiments are performed on two datasets,
   which illustrate the effectiveness of the extracted
   structural/functional connectivity features and the high computational
   efficiency of the proposed method. The classification accuracy of AD vs
   NC, AD vs MCI and MCI vs NC classification tasks reaches 88 . 71% , 82 .
   71% and 79 . 68% respectively. The extracted connectivity features
   between ROIs indicate that functional abnormalities are earlier than
   gray matter atrophy and abnormalities of structural connections, which
   is consistent with the clinical manifestations. The proposed method
   allows for the addition of other modal image features and non-image
   information from multi-modal data to continuously improve the
   perfor-mance of clinical data analysis.Conclusions: The proposed method
   can help us comprehensively analyze the role of gray matter atrophy, the
   damage of white matter nerve fiber tracts and the degradation of
   functional connectivity for different courses of AD, which could be
   useful for further extraction of clinical biomarkers for early AD
   identifica-tion. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the wide application of graph data in many fields, the research of
   graph representation learning technology has become the focus of
   scholars' attention. Especially, dynamic graph representation learning
   is an important part of solving the problem of change graph in reality.
   On the one hand, most dynamic graph representation methods focus either
   on graph structure changes or node embedding changes, ignoring the
   internal relationship. On the other hand, most dynamic graph neural
   networks require learn node embeddings from specific tasks, resulting in
   poor universality of node embeddings and cannot be used in unsupervised
   tasks. Hence, Dual Evolving Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DEDGCN)
   was proposed to solve the above problems. DEDGCN uses the recurrent
   neural network to push the evolvement of GCN and nodes, from which it
   can extract the structural features of dynamic graph and learns the
   stability features of nodes, respectively, forming an adaptive dynamic
   graph convolution network. DEDGCN can be classified as unsupervised
   graph convolutional network. Thus, it is capable of training the
   unlabeled dynamic graph, it has more extensive application scenarios,
   and the calculated node embedding has strong generality. We evaluate our
   proposed method on experimental data in three tasks which are node
   classification, edge classification, and link prediction. In the
   classification task, facing the graph with large scale, complex
   connection relationship, and uncertain change rule, the F1 value of node
   classification task obtained by DEDGCN reaches 77%, and the F1 value of
   edge classification task reaches more than 90%. The results show that
   DEDGCN is effective in capturing graph features, and the effect of
   DEDGCN is much higher than other baseline methods, which proves the
   importance of capturing node stability features in dynamic graph
   representation learning. At the same time, the ability of DEDGCN in
   unsupervised tasks is further verified by using clustering and anomaly
   detection tasks, which proves that DEDGCN learning network embedding is
   widely used.

AB Background and Objective: Sleep staging is an essential step for sleep
   disorder diagnosis, which is time-intensive and laborious for experts to
   perform this work manually. Automatic sleep stage classification methods
   not only alleviate experts from these demanding tasks but also enhance
   the accuracy and efficiency of the classification process. Methods: A
   novel multi-channel biosignal-based model constructed by the combination
   of a 3D convolutional operation and a graph convolutional operation is
   proposed for the automated sleep stages using various physiological
   signals. Both the 3D convolution and graph convolution can aggregate
   information from neighboring brain areas, which helps to learn intrinsic
   connections from the biosignals. Electroencephalogram (EEG),
   electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)
   signals are employed to extract time domain and frequency domain
   features. Subsequently, these signals are input to the 3D convolutional
   and graph convolutional branches, respectively. The 3D convolution
   branch can explore the correlations between multichannel signals and
   multi-band waves in each channel in the time series, while the graph
   convolution branch can explore the connections between each channel and
   each frequency band. In this work, we have developed the proposed
   multi-channel convolution combined sleep stage classification model
   (MixSleepNet) using ISRUC datasets (Subgroup 3 and 50 random samples
   from Subgroup 1). Results: Based on the first expert's label, our
   generated MixSleepNet yielded an accuracy, F1 -score and Cohen kappa
   scores of 0.830, 0.821 and 0.782, respectively for ISRUC-S3. It obtained
   accuracy, F1 -score and Cohen kappa scores of 0.812, 0.786, and 0.756,
   respectively for the ISRUC-S1 dataset. In accordance with the
   evaluations conducted by the second expert, the comprehensive
   accuracies, F1 -scores, and Cohen kappa coefficients for the ISRUC-S3
   and ISRUC-S1 datasets are determined to be 0.837, 0.820, 0.789, and
   0.829, 0.791, 0.775, respectively. Conclusion: The results of the
   performance metrics by the proposed method are much better than those
   from all the compared models. Additional experiments were carried out on
   the ISRUC-S3 sub-dataset to evaluate the contributions of each module
   towards the classification performance.

AB We recently identified FAM134B2, which is an N-terminal truncated
   reticulophagy receptor highly induced by starvation such as fasting of
   mice and treatment of mammalian cells with a starvation medium that does
   not contain amino acids, glucose and growth factors. However, which
   starvation signal mediates the induction of FAM134B2 is still obscure.
   In this study, we found that amino acid deficiency (AAD) could mimic the
   starvation condition to induce FAM134B2 expression. Unexpectedly,
   EIF2AK4/GCN2-mediated integrated signal response (ISR) and MTOR
   (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) signals, which constitute two
   major signaling pathways that respond to AAD, did not contribute to
   AAD-induced FAM134B2 induction. mRNA-seq and siRNA screenings identified
   two ISR-independent transcription factors, MEF2D (myocyte enhancer
   factor 2D) and NR4A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1),
   involved in AAD-induced FAM134B2 expression. AAD induces MEF2D,
   resulting in the induction of NR4A1, which in turn induces
   FAM134B2-mediated reticulophagy to maintain intracellular amino acid
   levels. In conclusion, the MEF2D-NR4A1-FAM134B2 cascade is a critical
   signal in amino acid homeostasis.

AB Rapid economic development and industrialization may include
   environmentally harmful human activities that cause heavy-metal
   accumulation in soils, ultimately threatening the quality of the soil
   environment and human health. Therefore, accurate identification of
   pollution sources is an important weapon in efforts to control and
   prevent pollution. The self-organizing map (SOM) method is widely used
   in pollution source identification because of its capacity for
   visualization of high-dimensional data. The SOM ignores the graph
   structure relationship among chemical elements in soils; the SOM
   analysis of pollution sources has high uncertainty. Here, we propose a
   new analysis method, i.e., the graph convolutional self-organizing map
   (GCSOM), which uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract the
   graph structure relationship among the chemical elements in soils, then
   performs data visualization using an SOM. We compared the performances
   of GCSOM and SOM, then assessed the pollution source characteristics of
   trace metal(loid)s (TMs, mostly heavy metals) in Jiangmen City using the
   GCSOM. Our experimental results showed that the GCSOM is superior to the
   SOM for identification of TM sources, while the TMs in the soil of
   Jiangmen originate from three main sources: agricultural activities
   (mainly in Taishan City, Jiangmen), traffic emissions (mainly in Xinhui
   and Pengjiang Districts), and industrial activities (mainly in Xinhui
   District). The risk assessment indicated that the risk of all TMs was
   within threshold.

AB In recent years, various deep learning architectures have been proposed
   to solve complex challenges (e.g. spatial dependency, temporal
   dependency) in traffic domain, which have achieved satisfactory
   performance. These architectures are composed of multiple deep learning
   techniques in order to tackle various challenges in traffic tasks.
   Traditionally, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to model
   spatial dependency by decomposing the traffic network as grids. However,
   many traffic networks are graph-structured in nature. In order to
   utilize such spatial information fully, it's more appropriate to
   formulate traffic networks as graphs mathematically. Recently, various
   novel deep learning techniques have been developed to process graph
   data, called graph neural networks (GNNs). More and more works combine
   GNNs with other deep learning techniques to construct an architecture
   dealing with various challenges in a complex traffic task, where GNNs
   are responsible for extracting spatial correlations in traffic network.
   These graph-based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art
   performance. To provide a comprehensive and clear picture of such
   emerging trend, this survey carefully examines various graph-based deep
   learning architectures in many traffic applications. We first give
   guidelines to formulate a traffic problem based on graph and construct
   graphs from various kinds of traffic datasets. Then we decompose these
   graph-based architectures to discuss their shared deep learning
   techniques, clarifying the utilization of each technique in traffic
   tasks. What's more, we summarize some common traffic challenges and the
   corresponding graph-based deep learning solutions to each challenge.
   Finally, we provide benchmark datasets, open source codes and future
   research directions in this rapidly growing field.

   prepared by a simple and cost-effective calcination method. The
   crystalline structure, functional groups, morphological and optical
   properties of the as-prepared g-C3N4/ZnO/Fe2O3 (GZF) ternary composite
   were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis
   diffuse-reflectance spectroscopic techniques. The GZF composite reveals
   enhanced methylene blue (MB) degradation with good photostability of
   100% retention rate even after 5 cycles under visible light irradiation.
   Moreover, GZF composite was degraded 94% of MB after 120 min under
   visible light irradiation which was almost 6.6- and 3.1-fold higher than
   individual g-C3N4 (GCN) and g-C3N4/ZnO (GZ). The results suggest that
   the composites of g-C3N4 with metal oxide under visible light
   significantly enhance the electron transfer process.

AB To improve the efficiency of safety management, it is important to
   classify massive and complex construction site safety hazard texts in
   large-scale projects. High-precision safety hazard text classification
   is a lengthy and challenging process. Most existing safety hazard text
   classification methods capture semantic information using machine
   learning or deep learning, ignoring the syntactic dependency between
   words. However, syntactic dependency contains rich structural
   information that is useful to alleviate information loss and enrich text
   features. To address these issues, this study proposes a graph
   structure-based hybrid deep learning method to achieve the automatic
   classification of large-scale project safety hazard texts. The method
   uses syntactic dependency and Bidirectional Encoder Representation from
   Transformers to express the syntactic structure and semantic information
   of text, and a graph structure fusing the syntactic structure and
   semantic information is constructed to quantify text information.
   Further, an encoding-decoding mechanism is built using a graph
   convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory to
   address graph structure data and classify safety hazard texts. Our
   proposed method is used to classify hydraulic engineering construction
   safety hazard texts, and the classification accuracy reaches 86.56%.
   Meanwhile, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
   superior performance compared to existing methods. This proves the
   ability of our model to capture and analyze text information and
   verifies the reliability and effectiveness of this method in large-scale
   project safety hazard management.

AB Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims at finding out how people feel
   emotionally towards different visual stimuli, which has attracted great
   attention recently with the prevalence of sharing images on social
   networks. Since human emotion involves a highly complex and abstract
   cognitive process, it is difficult to infer visual emotions directly
   from holistic or regional features in affective images. It has been
   demonstrated in psychology that visual emotions are evoked by the
   interactions between objects as well as the interactions between objects
   and scenes within an image. Inspired by this, we propose a novel
   Scene-Object interreLated Visual Emotion Reasoning network (SOLVER) to
   predict emotions from images. To mine the emotional relationships
   between distinct objects, we first build up an Emotion Graph based on
   semantic concepts and visual features. Then, we conduct reasoning on the
   Emotion Graph using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), yielding
   emotion-enhanced object features. We also design a Scene-Object Fusion
   Module to integrate scenes and objects, which exploits scene features to
   guide the fusion process of object features with the proposed
   scene-based attention mechanism. Extensive experiments and comparisons
   are conducted on eight public visual emotion datasets, and the results
   demonstrate that the proposed SOLVER consistently outperforms the
   state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Ablation studies verify the
   effectiveness of our method and visualizations prove its
   interpretability, which also bring new insight to explore the mysteries
   in VEA. Notably, we further discuss SOLVER on three other potential
   datasets with extended experiments, where we validate the robustness of
   our method and notice some limitations of it.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have attracted an increasing
   amount of attention in recent years. Thanks to the fast development of
   vehicular computing hardware, vehicular sensors and citywide
   infrastructures, many impressive applications have been proposed under
   the topic of ITS, such as Vehicular Cloud (VC), intelligent traffic
   controls, etc. These applications can bring us a safer, more efficient,
   and also more enjoyable transportation environment. However, an accurate
   and efficient traffic flow prediction system is needed to achieve these
   applications, which creates an opportunity for applications under ITS to
   deal with the possible road situation in advance. To achieve better
   traffic flow prediction performance, many prediction methods have been
   proposed, such as mathematical modeling methods, parametric methods, and
   non-parametric methods. Among the non-parametric methods, the one of the
   most famous methods today is the Machine Learningbased (ML) method. It
   needs less prior knowledge about the relationship among different
   traffic patterns, less restriction on prediction tasks, and can better
   fit non-linear features in traffic data. There are several sub-classes
   under the ML method, such as regression model, kernel-based model, etc.
   For all these models, it is of vital importance that we choose an
   appropriate type of ML model before building up a prediction system. To
   do this, we should have a clear view of different ML methods; we
   investigate not only the accuracy of different models, but the
   applicable scenario and sometimes the specific type of problem the model
   was designed for. Therefore, in this paper, we are trying to build up a
   clear and thorough review of different ML models, and analyze the
   advantages and disadvantages of these ML models. In order to do this,
   different ML models will be categorized based on the ML theory they use.
   In each category, we will first give a short introduction of the ML
   theory they use, and we will focus on the specific changes made to the
   model when applied to different prediction problems. Meanwhile, we will
   also compare among different categories, which will help us to have a
   macro overview of what types of ML methods are good at what types of
   prediction tasks according to their unique model features. Furthermore,
   we review the useful add-ons used in traffic prediction, and last but
   not least, we discuss the open challenges in the traffic prediction
   field.

AB In the remote sensing domain, it is crucial to complete semantic
   segmentation on the raster images, e.g., river, building, forest, etc.,
   on raster images. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network is
   the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed
   images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not
   designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain
   is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic
   segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main
   contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global
   convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions
   by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network.
   Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone
   using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution
   remotely sensed images. Second, channel attention is presented in our
   network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features).
   Third, domain-specific transfer learning is introduced to alleviate the
   scarcity issue by utilizing other remotely sensed corpora with different
   resolutions as pre-trained data. The experiment was then conducted on
   two given datasets: (i) medium resolution data collected from Landsat-8
   satellite and (ii) very high resolution data called the ISPRS Vaihingen
   Challenge Dataset. The results show that our networks outperformed DCED
   in terms of F1 for 17.48% and 2.49% on medium and very high resolution
   corpora, respectively.

AB Accurate and real-time trajectory data publishing plays an important
   role in providing users with the latest traffic and road condition
   information to help in rationally planning travel time and routes.
   However, the improper publishing of location information and reverse
   analysis and reasoning can easily leak users' personal information,
   which may threaten users' privacy and lives. Owing to the inclusion of
   differential privacy model noise, privacy protection introduces
   inaccuracies in data publishing and validity. To improve the accuracy
   and usability of published data, we propose a data publishing method
   based on deep learning and differential privacy models for securing
   spatiotemporal trajectory data publishing. The method divides the
   trajectory data into two-dimensional grid regions, counts the density of
   trajectories at grids, performs a top-down recursive division of
   regions, and formulates rules for privacy budget allocation from
   multiple perspectives as recurrence depth increases. Furthermore, the
   method integrates spatiotemporal sequence data according to temporal
   order. Subsequently, it extracts temporal and spatial features of the
   data by the temporal graph convolutional network model for budget matrix
   prediction, adds Laplace noise to the regions, and evaluates the effect
   of differential privacy protection with the original data to protect
   trajectory data privacy. Experiments demonstrate that under the premise
   of satisfying epsilon-difference privacy, the query error and
   Jensen-Shannon divergence are smaller, the Kendall coefficient is more
   consistent, and the upper and lower limit values are more stable. Hence,
   the top-down division method achieves better results than those of the
   two traditional region division methods of the uniform grid and adaptive
   grid. The proposed method can be used to allocate the privacy budget
   more reasonably and achieve privacy protection of trajectories, which
   can be applied to a large amount of spatiotemporal trajectory data.

AB Scene classification is an active research area in the remote sensing
   (RS) domain. Some categories of RS scenes, such as medium residential
   and dense residential scenes, would contain the same type of
   geographical objects but have various spatial distributions among these
   objects. The adjacency and disjointness relationships among geographical
   objects are normally neglected by existing RS scene classification
   methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, a
   multi-output network (MopNet) combining a graph neural network (GNN) and
   a CNN is proposed for RS scene classification with a joint loss. In a
   candidate RS image for scene classification, superpixel regions are
   constructed through image segmentation and are represented as graph
   nodes, while graph edges between nodes are created according to the
   spatial adjacency among corresponding superpixel regions. A training
   strategy of a jointly learning CNN and GNN is adopted in the MopNet.
   Through the message propagation mechanism of MopNet, spatial and
   topological relationships imbedded in the edges of graphs are employed.
   The parameters of the CNN and GNN in MopNet are updated simultaneously
   with the guidance of a joint loss via the backpropagation mechanism.
   Experimental results on the OPTIMAL-31 and aerial image dataset (AID)
   datasets show that the proposed MopNet combining a graph convolutional
   network (GCN) or graph attention network (GAT) and ResNet50 achieves
   state-of-the-art accuracy. The overall accuracy obtained on OPTIMAL-31
   is 96.06% and those on AID are 95.53% and 97.11% under training ratios
   of 20% and 50%, respectively. Spatial and topological relationships
   imbedded in RS images are helpful for improving the performance of scene
   classification.

AB While traffic modeling and prediction are at the heart of providing
   high-quality telecommunication services in cellular networks and attract
   much attention, they have been approved as an extremely challenging
   task. Due to the diverse network demand of Internet-based apps, the
   cellular traffic from an individual user can have a wide dynamic range.
   Most existing methods, on the other hand, model traffic patterns as
   probabilistic distributions or stochastic processes and impose stringent
   assumptions over these models. Such assumptions may be beneficial at
   providing closed-form formula in evaluating prediction performances, but
   fall short for practice use. In this paper we propose STEP, a
   spatio-temporal fine-granular user traffic prediction mechanism for
   cellular networks. A deep graph convolution network, called GCGRN, is
   constructed. It is a novel combination of the graph convolution network
   (GCN) and gated recurrent units (GRU), which exploits graph neural
   network to learn an efficient spatio-temporal model from a user's
   massive dataset for traffic prediction. The prototype of STEP has been
   implemented. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
   outperforms the state-of-the-art time-series based approaches. Besides,
   STEP merely incurs mild energy consumption, communication overhead and
   system resource occupancy to mobile devices. Moreover, NS-3 based
   simulations validate the efficacy of STEP in reducing session dropping
   ratio in cellular networks.

AB Citation recommendation can help researchers quickly find supplementary
   or alternative references in massive academic resources. Current
   research on citation recommendation mainly focuses on the citing papers,
   resulting in the enormous cited papers are ignored, including the
   relations among cited papers and their citation context cited in citing
   papers. Moreover, cited paper's content is often denoted with its
   original title and abstract, which is hard to acquire and rarely
   considers different citation motivations. Furthermore, the most
   appropriate method for semantic representation of cited papers'
   relations and content is uncertain. Therefore, this paper studies
   citation recommendation from the perspective of semantic representation
   of cited papers' relations and content. Firstly, four forms of citation
   context are designed and extracted as cited papers' content considering
   citation motivations, as well as co-citation relationships are extracted
   as cited papers' relations. Secondly, 132 methods are designed for
   generating semantic vector of cited paper, including four network
   embedding methods, 16 methods by combining four text representation
   algorithms with four forms of citation content, and 112 fusion methods.
   Finally, similarity among cited papers is calculated for citation
   recommendation and a quantitative evaluation method based on link
   prediction is designed, to find the most appropriate form of citation
   content and the optimal method. The result shows that doc2vecC (Document
   to Vector through Corruption) with the form of CS&SS (Current Sentences
   and Surrounding Sentences) performs best, in which the AUC (Area Under
   Curve) and MAP (Macro Average Precision) reach 0.877 and 0.889 and have
   increased by 0.462 and 0.370 compared with the worst-performing method.
   This performance is slightly improved by parameters adjustment, and a
   case study is performed whose results have further proved the
   effectiveness of this method. In addition, among four forms of cited
   papers' content, CS&SS performs best in almost all methods. Furthermore,
   the fusion methods not always perform better than the single methods,
   where doc2vecC (CS&SS) performs better than the best fusion method GCN
   (Graph Convolutional Network). These results not only prove the
   effectiveness of citation recommendation from the perspective of cited
   paper, but also provide helpful and useful suggestions for method
   selection and citation content selection. The data and conclusions can
   be extended to other text mining-related tasks. Simultaneously, it is a
   preliminary research which needs to be further studied in other domains
   using emerging semantic representation methods.

AB Although many graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have achieved
   superior performances in semisupervised node classification, they are
   designed from either the spatial or spectral perspective, yet without a
   general theoretical basis. Besides, most of the existing GCNNs methods
   tend to ignore the ubiquitous noises in the network topology and node
   content and are thus unable to model these uncertainties. These
   drawbacks certainly reduce their effectiveness in integrating network
   topology and node content. To provide a probabilistic perspective to the
   GCNNs, we model the semisupervised node classification problem as a
   topology-constrained probabilistic latent space model, probabilistic
   graph convolutional network (PGCN). By representing the nodes in a more
   efficient distribution form, the proposed framework can seamlessly
   integrate the node content and network topology. When specifying the
   distribution in PGCN to be a Gaussian distribution, the transductive
   node classification problems can be solved by the general framework and
   a specific method, called PGCN with the Gaussian distribution
   representation (PGCN-G), is proposed. To overcome the overfitting
   problem in covariance estimation and reduce the computational
   complexity, PGCN-G is further improved to PGCN-G+ by imposing the
   covariance matrices of all vertices to possess the identical singular
   vectors. The optimization algorithm based on expectation-maximization
   indicates that the proposed method can iteratively denoise the network
   topology and node content with respect to each other. Besides the
   effectiveness of this top-down framework demonstrated via extensive
   experiments, it can also be deduced to cover the existing methods, graph
   convolutional network, graph attention network, and Gaussian mixture
   model and elaborate their characteristics and relationships by specific
   derivations.

AB Existing malicious device detection preprocessing ignores the
   topological similarity of node neighborhood structures in the network.
   According to the structural equivalence hypothesis, devices with
   approximately local symmetry in the device-account graph have similar
   topological embeddings after preprocessing. In order to improve the
   performance of malicious device detection, we propose the Graph
   Structural-topic Similar Subgraph Merging, abbreviated GraphSTSGM, to
   extract topological similarity between nodes. GraphSTSGM extracts
   approximate local symmetry features by adding local neighborhood
   structural patterns merge to Graph Structural-topic Neural Network
   (GraphSTONE). In this algorithm, we build a device-account relationship
   graph G with devices and accounts as nodes, build an edge between
   associated devices and accounts, and then calculate the approximate
   local symmetry of each device via the merge-similar-substructures-based
   anonymous walk in G. Then, the approximate local symmetry features and
   device features of the nodes are aggregated through Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN). We use the above algorithm as a preprocessing method to
   enhance the ability of malicious device detection by accurately
   characterizing the approximate local symmetry features of nodes.
   Finally, the obtained aggregated features are used as the input of the
   Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
   model for malicious device detection. Experiments based on Alibaba Cloud
   Security data show that the proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art
   algorithms by 3.6% with respect to the AUC of malicious device
   detection. In addition, experiments based on the graph dataset Cora show
   that the proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by 2.6%
   with respect to the AUC of node classification.

AB The graduation development such as employment and graduate school
   admission of college students are important tasks. However, mining the
   factors that can affect the development of graduation remains
   challenging, because the most important factor "course" is not
   independent and inequality, which are always ignored by previous
   researchers. Furthermore, traditional structured methods cannot handle
   the complex relationships between courses, and attention networks cannot
   distinguish the weights of compulsory and elective courses with
   different distributions. Therefore, we present a Graph-based
   Hierarchical Attention Neural Network Model with Elective Course
   (GHANN-EC) for the prediction of graduation development in this study.
   Specifically, we use graph embedding that captures the unstructured
   relationships between courses and hierarchical attention that assigns
   the importance of the courses to excavating course information that
   represent students' independent interests, and can more accurately
   understand the relationship between graduation development and academic
   performance. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show that
   GHANN-EC outperforms the existing popular approach.

AB In skeleton-based human action recognition, Transformer, which models
   the correlations between joint pairs in global topology, has achieved
   remarkable results. However, compared to many researches on changing
   graph topology learning in graph convolution network (GCN), Transformer
   self-attention ignores the topology of the skeleton graph when capturing
   the dependencies between joints. To address these problems, we propose a
   novel two-stream spatial Graphormer network (2s-SGR), which uses
   self-attention incorporating structural encodings to model joint and
   bone information, and which consists of two networks, the joint stream
   spatial Graphormer network (Js-SGR) and the bone stream spatial
   Graphormer network (Bs-SGR). First, in the Js-SGR, while Transformer
   models joint correlations in the global topology of the space, the
   topology of the joints and the edge information of the bones are
   introduced into the self-attention through custom structural encodings.
   At the same time, joint motion information is modeled in
   spatial-temporal blocks. The added information on structure and motion
   can effectively capture the dependencies of nodes between frames and
   enhance feature representation. Second, for the second-order information
   of the skeleton, the Bs-SGR adapts to the structure of the bone by
   adjusting the custom structural encodings. Finally, the global
   spatial-temporal features of joints and bones in the skeleton are fused
   and input into the classification network to obtain action recognition
   results. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D
   60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics, demonstrate that the performance of the
   2s-SGR proposed in this paper is at the state-of-the-art level and is
   effectively validated by ablation experiments.

AB Motivation: Protein function prediction is a difficult bioinformatics
   problem. Many recent methods use deep neural networks to learn complex
   sequence representations and predict function from these. Deep
   supervised models require a lot of labeled training data which are not
   available for this task. However, a very large amount of protein
   sequences without functional labels is available.
   Results: We applied an existing deep sequence model that had been
   pretrained in an unsupervised setting on the supervised task of protein
   molecular function prediction. We found that this complex feature
   representation is effective for this task, outperforming hand-crafted
   features such as one-hot encoding of amino acids, k-mer counts,
   secondary structure and backbone angles. Also, it partly negates the
   need for complex prediction models, as a two-layer perceptron was enough
   to achieve competitive performance in the third Critical Assessment of
   Functional Annotation benchmark. We also show that combining this
   sequence representation with protein 3D structure information does not
   lead to performance improvement, hinting that 3D structure is also
   potentially learned during the unsupervised pretraining.

AB Human activity recognition is one of the most studied topics in the

   RGB-D sensors and powerful deep learning techniques, research on human
   activity recognition has gained momentum. From simple human atomic
   actions, the research has advanced towards recognizing more complex
   human activities using RGB-D data. This paper presents a comprehensive
   survey of the advanced deep learning based recognition methods and
   categorizes them in human atomic action, human-human interaction,
   human-object interaction. The reviewed methods are further classified
   based on the individual modality used for recognition i.e. RGB based,
   depth based, skeleton based, and hybrid. We also review and categorize
   recent challenging RGB-D datasets for the same. In addition, the paper
   also briefly reviews RGB-D datasets and methods for online activity
   recognition. The paper concludes with a discussion on limitations,

AB Graph representations are often used to model structured data at an
   individual or population level and have numerous applications in pattern
   recognition problems. In the field of neuroscience, where such
   representations are commonly used to model structural or functional
   connectivity between a set of brain regions, graphs have proven to be of
   great importance. This is mainly due to the capability of revealing
   patterns related to brain development and disease, which were previously
   unknown. Evaluating similarity between these brain connectivity networks
   in a manner that accounts for the graph structure and is tailored for a
   particular application is, however, non-trivial. Most existing methods
   fail to accommodate the graph structure, discarding information that
   could be beneficial for further classification or regression analyses
   based on these similarities. We propose to learn a graph similarity
   metric using a siamese graph convolutional neural network (s-GCN) in a
   supervised setting. The proposed framework takes into consideration the
   graph structure for the evaluation of similarity between a pair of
   graphs, by employing spectral graph convolutions that allow the
   generalisation of traditional convolutions to irregular graphs and
   operates in the graph spectral domain. We apply the proposed model on
   two datasets: the challenging ABIDE database, which comprises functional
   MRI data of 403 patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 468
   healthy controls aggregated from multiple acquisition sites, and a set
   of 2500 subjects from UK Biobank. We demonstrate the performance of the
   method for the tasks of classification between matching and non-matching
   graphs, as well as individual subject classification and manifold
   learning, showing that it leads to significantly improved results
   compared to traditional methods.

AB The mushroom growth of cellular users requires novel advancements in the
   existing cellular infrastructure. One way to handle such a tremendous
   increase is to densely deploy terrestrial small-cell base stations
   (TSBSs) with careful management of smart backhaul/fronthaul networks.
   Nevertheless, terrestrial backhaul hubs significantly suffer from the
   dense fading environment and are difficult to install in a typical urban
   environment. Therefore, this paper considers the idea of replacing
   terrestrial backhaul network with an aerial network consisting of
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide the fronthaul connectivity
   between the TSBSs and the ground core-network (GCN). To this end, we
   focus on the joint positioning of UAVs and the association of TSBSs such
   that the sum-rate of the overall system is maximized. In particular, the
   association problem of TSBSs with UAVs is formulated under
   communication-related constraints, i.e., bandwidth, number of
   connections to a UAV, power limit, interference threshold, UAV heights,
   and backhaul data rate. To meet this joint objective, we take advantage
   of the genetic algorithm (GA) due to the offline nature of our
   optimization problem. The performance of the proposed approach is
   evaluated using the unsupervised learning-based k-means clustering
   algorithm. We observe that the proposed approach is highly effective to
   satisfy the requirements of smart fronthaul networks.

AB The rational design of ultralong carbon nitride nanostructures is highly
   attractive due to their high aspect ratio alongside their high
   surface-to-bulk ratio, which make them suitable candidates for various
   applications such as photocatalysts, water treatment, and sensors.
   However, the synthesis of ultralong, continuous carbon nitride wires is
   highly challenging. Here we report the synthesis of 4 cm long and large
   lateral size carbon nitride wires by utilizing unique supramolecular
   spheres composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) monomers as the
   reactants. In situ scanning electron microscopy studies reveal that upon
   calcination the gCN wires spontaneously start to grow from the spheres,
   while the remaining assembly which acts as a substrate creates
   self-standing carbon rich g-CN porous films. The different morphology,
   chemical composition, and electronic properties of the wires and
   carbon-rich g-CN allow their utilization as both photocatalyst and water
   cleaning materials. The g-CN wires exhibit excellent photoactivity for
   hydrogen production whereas the porous carbon-rich g-CN porous film can
   be efficiently used for water cleaning applications. The reported work
   opens opportunities for tailored design of g-CN nanostructures and their
   use as multifunctional materials for photocatalysis, sensing, and other
   energy-related applications.

AB ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCTs) is one of the largest gene
   superfamily comprising of integral membrane proteins that are
   ubiquitously found in all domains of life and implicated in ATP
   dependent active transport of ligands across the concentration gradient.
   We present here the identification and distribution of ABC proteins from
   seven plant species into four groups (Full, Half, Quarter and ABC2
   molecules), eight families (ABCA to ABCG and ABCI) and twelve sub
   families (MDR, PDR, MRP, PMP, AOH, ATH, ATM, TAP, WBC, RLI, GCN and NAP)
   based on topology, orientation, size, and phylogenetic relationships
   with main focus on four cotton species especially tetraploid Gossypium
   hirsutum (Gh) encoding 320 ORFs. Dynamics of complex formation of
   structurally characterized ABCTs from each subfamily shows their kinetic
   and molecular mechanisms to combine the ATP hydrolysis and binding for
   substrate translocation, portraying a "structure to function
   relationship". Analysis of protein motif and genomic organizations
   displayed structural and functional conservation within same subfamily
   but diverged among the different subfamilies. Abundance of small sized
   single ABCs signifies the higher gene death/birth rate and ongoing
   evolution for functional advancements and environmental adaptability.
   Gene duplication relationship analysis illustrates the major role of
   tandem and segmental duplication in large scale expansion of ABC gene
   family in mentioned species. The overall Ka/Ks ratio indicated the
   intense purifying selection of ABC genes in four cotton species during
   evolution. In addition, tissue specific expression profiling, abiotic
   stress resistance and Co-expression networking of GhABCs infers their
   role in diverse range of molecular, cellular and biological processes.
   Cis-elements and gene enrichments also supported their predicted roles
   in substrates translocation, xenobiotic detoxification, lipid
   metabolism, hormonal and abiotic stresses responses. Forward and reverse
   genetics along with evolutionary trajectories, structural dynamics and
   validated expression profiling will provide much-needed clarity and a
   qualitative molecular framework for future research. This study will
   further broaden our insights into the evolution and functional
   elucidation of ABC gene family in cotton.

AB In recent years, the motion capture system has received a lot of
   attention because of its wide application, such as movie animation,
   sport and medical applications. In the field of rehabilitation, motion
   capture systems are often used to collect the motion information of the
   patient when he/she is performing rehabilitation tasks. It can be used
   to quantify the patient's rehabilitation effectiveness and provide the
   physician with more objective data as a reference. Using inertial
   sensors is one of motion capture methods. However, the major challenge
   to reconstruct accurate human posture with sensor measurements are
   signal noise, bias and inaccurate gyroscope estimation during long-term
   wearing. Based on the reason mentioned above, this paper proposes a
   graph convolutional network (GCN)-based deep learning architecture that
   uses effective information collected by inertial sensors to predict a
   sequence of position of each joint of a human's lower limbs in the 3D
   space throughout the entire motion. Such motion prediction result based
   on the deep learning model is to reduce the joint's tracking error
   relying only on direct calculations based on measurements of inertial
   sensors. In the final experiment, the lower limb motion trajectory
   during walking is used to verify that the method proposed in this work
   can actually outperform the traditional ones as just mentioned by
   achieving 2.9 mm drop in mean per joint position error (MPJPE) in 3.6M
   dataset, resulting in 12.2 mm in MPJPE, and mitigate the drift in real
   scenario. In our future work, we plan to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed model and system for rehabilitation through clinical studies.

AB Point clouds are the most general data representations of real and
   abstract objects, and have a wide variety of applications in many
   science and engineering fields. Point clouds also provide the most
   scalable multi-resolution composition for geometric structures. Although
   point cloud learning has shown remarkable results in shape estimation
   and semantic segmentation, the unsupervised generation of 3D object
   parts still pose significant challenges in the 3D shape understanding
   problem. We address this problem by proposing a novel Generative
   Adversarial Network (GAN), named HSGAN, or Hierarchical Self-Attention
   GAN, with remarkable properties for 3D shape generation. Our generative
   model takes a random code and hierarchically transforms it into a
   representation graph by incorporating both Graph Convolution Network
   (GCN) and self-attention. With embedding the global graph topology in
   shape generation, the proposed model takes advantage of the latent
   topological information to fully construct the geometry of 3D object
   shapes. Different from the existing generative pipelines, our deep
   learning architecture articulates three significant properties HSGAN
   effectively deploys the compact latent topology information as a graph
   representation in the generative learning process and generates
   realistic point clouds, HSGAN avoids multiple discriminator updates per
   generator update, and HSGAN preserves the most dominant geometric
   structures of 3D shapes in the same hierarchical sampling process. We
   demonstrate the performance of our new approach with both quantitative
   and qualitative evaluations. We further present a new adversarial loss
   to maintain the training stability and overcome the potential mode
   collapse of traditional GANs. Finally, we explore the use of HSGAN as a
   plug-and-play decoder in the auto-encoding architecture.

AB IMPORTANCE Repeat expansion of CGG in LRP12 has been identified as the
   causative variation of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM). However, to
   our knowledge, the clinicopathologic features of OPDM with CGG repeat
   expansion in LRP12 (hereafter referred to as OPDM_LRP12) remain unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To identify and characterize the clinicopathologic features of
   patients with OPQM_LRP12.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case series included 208 patients
   with a clinical or clinicopathologic diagnosis of oculopharyngeal
   muscular dystrophy (OPDM) from January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2020.
   Patients with GCN repeat expansions in PABPNI were excluded from the
   study. Repeat expansions of CGG in LRP12 were screened by repeat primed
   polymerase chain reaction and/or Southern blot.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical information, muscle imaging data
   obtained by either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging,
   and muscle pathologic characteristics.
   RESULTS Sixty-five Japanese patients with OPDM (40 men [62%]; mean [SD]
   age at onset, 41.0 [10.1] years) from 59 families with CGG repeat
   expansions in LRP12 were identified. This represents the most common
   OPDM subtype among all patients in Japan with genetically diagnosed
   OPDM. The expansions ranged from 85 to 289 repeats. A negative
   correlation was observed between the repeat size and the age at onset
   (r(2) = 0.188, P = .001). The most common initial symptoms were ptosis
   and muscle weakness, present in 24 patients (37%). Limb muscle weakness
   was predominantly distal in 53 of 64 patients (83%), but 2 of 64
   patients (3%) had predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Ptosis was
   observed in 62 of 64 patients (97%), and dysphagia or dysarthria was
   observed in 63 of 64 patients (98%). A total of 21 of 64 patients (33%)
   had asymmetric muscle weakness. Aspiration pneumonia was seen in 11 of
   64 patients (17%), and 5 of 64 patients (8%) required mechanical
   ventilation. Seven of 64 patients (11%) developed cardiac abnormalities,
   and 5 of 64 patients (8%) developed neurologic abnormalities. Asymmetric
   muscle involvement was detected on computed tomography scans in 6 of 27
   patients (22%) and on magnetic resonance imaging scans in 4 of 15
   patients (27%), with the soleus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius
   being the worst affected. All 42 muscle biopsy samples showed rimmed
   vacuoles. lntranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions were observed in
   only 1 of 5 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that OPDM_LRP12 is the
   most frequent OPDM subtype in Japan and is characterized by
   oculopharyngeal weakness, distal myopathy that especially affects the
   soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsy.

AB Accurately predicting the fluids holds immense significance in
   exploration work, assisting in the identification of exploration
   targets, estimation of reserve potential, and evaluation of reservoirs.
   In our research, we employed an innovative approach by using the gram
   angle field (GAF) to transform logging parameters. By adeptly capturing
   time series information and converting one-dimensional data into
   two-dimensional matrix representations, GAF takes into account not only
   the values at each time point but also their relative position and
   order. This method effectively preserves the temporal evolution
   characteristics of the original data. The resulting Gram Angle Field
   matrix can be viewed as a two-dimensional image, facilitating
   visualization and analysis through image processing techniques.
   Additionally, we introduced the dynamic graph convolutional network
   (DGCN) to segment the transformed images. The DGCN structure, employed
   for feature learning, can extract more comprehensive and representative
   feature representations from the logging data. Since logging data
   demonstrate a time series relationship, indicating a temporal
   correlation between logging curves at different depths, DGCN utilizes
   dynamic graph structures to capture and comprehend this time series
   information. This capability enables DGCN to model the evolution process
   of well log data effectively. DGCN assigns varying weights to nodes and
   edges at each time step, updating the current node representation with
   information from neighboring nodes. This localized approach enables DGCN
   to meticulously focus on significant features at each time step,
   facilitating the identification of potential patterns and trends in the
   logging data. Our research not only paves the way for advancements in
   the field but also provides valuable insights for geologists and
   professionals engaged in oil and gas exploration.

AB Recommender systems are designed to help users find matching items from
   plenty of candidates in online platforms. In many online platforms, such
   as Yelp and Epinions, users' behaviors are constantly recorded over
   time, and the users also can build connections with others and share
   their interests. Previous recommendation methods have either modeled the
   dynamic interests or the dynamic social influences. A few studies have
   focused on the modeling of both factors, but they still have several
   limi-tations: 1) they fail to consider the complex items transitions
   among all session sequences, which can be used as a local factor to
   boost the performance of recommendation methods, and 2) they ignore that
   a user and their friends only share the same preferences in certain
   sessions, by keeping the friend vector unchanged for all target users at
   time t, and 3) they do not consider that a user's long-term preference
   may change with the evolution of interests.
   To overcome the above issues, in this paper, we propose an approach to
   incorporate item graph embedding and contextual friendship modeling into
   the recommendation task. Specifically, 1) we construct a directed item
   graph based on all historical session sequences and utilize a graph
   neural network to capture the rich local dependency between items, and
   2) take a session-level attention mechanism to get each friend's
   representation according to the target user's current interests, and 3)
   apply max-pooling on the target user's historical session interests to
   learn the dynamics of his/her long-term interests. Extensive experiments
   on two real-world datasets show that our proposed model outperforms
   stateof-the-art methods consistently on various evaluation metrics. (c)

AB Introduction: Recent studies in human brain connectomics with multimodal
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have widely reported abnormalities
   in brain structure, function and connectivity associated with
   schizophrenia (SZ). However, most previous discriminative studies of SZ
   patients were based on MRI features of brain regions, ignoring the
   complex relationships within brain networks.
   Methods: We applied a graph convolutional network (GCN) to
   discriminating SZ patients using the features of brain region and
   connectivity derived from a combined multimodal MRI and connectomics
   analysis. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were acquired from
   140 SZ patients and 205 normal controls. Eighteen types of brain graphs
   were constructed for each subject using 3 types of node features, 3
   types of edge features, and 2 brain atlases. We investigated the
   performance of 18 brain graphs and used the TopK pooling layers to
   highlight salient brain regions (nodes in the graph).
   Results: The GCN model, which used functional connectivity as edge
   features and multimodal features (sMRI + fMRI) of brain regions as node
   features, obtained the highest average accuracy of 95.8%, and
   outperformed other existing classification studies in SZ patients. In
   the explainability analysis, we reported that the top 10 salient brain
   regions, predominantly distributed in the prefrontal and occipital
   cortices, were mainly involved in the systems of emotion and visual
   processing.
   Discussion: Our findings demonstrated that GCN with a combined
   multimodal MRI and connectomics analysis can effectively improve the
   classification of SZ at an individual level, indicating a promising
   direction for the diagnosis of SZ patients. The code is available at
   https://github.com/CXY-scut/GCN-SZ.git.

AB Research in semi-supervised learning on graphs has attracted more and
   more attention in recent years, as learning on graphs is applied in more
   and more domains and labeling data is expensive and time-consuming. Some
   scenarios have inherent graph structures in their data, such as the
   relationships between people in social scenarios or the relationships
   between objects that are mutually referenced. However, there are also
   many data types without inherent graph structures, such as image data,
   and each image can be described with different features, which is a
   typical type of multi-view data. For image data and other non-graph
   data, there are significantly fewer deep learning approaches that target
   multi-view graph-based semi-supervised learning. This paper attempts to
   fill this gap. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   architecture, we propose a Sample-weighted Fused Graph-based
   Semi-supervised Classification (WFGSC) method for multi view data in
   this paper. It (i) constructs a semi-supervised graph in each view using
   a flexible model for joint graph and label estimation, (ii) obtains an
   additional graph based on the representation of nodes provided by the
   joint estimator, and then obtains a fused graph between all views, (iii)
   gives higher weights to hard-to-classify samples, (iv) proposes a loss
   function to train the GCN on the fused features and the consensus graph
   that integrates graph auto-encoder loss and label smoothing over the
   consensus graph. The results of our experiments on six multi-view
   datasets show that our WFGSC performs well on both fused graph
   construction and semi-supervised classification, and generally
   outperforms traditional GCNs and other multi-view semi-supervised
   multi-view classification methods.1

AB Stereopsis is the ability of human beings to get the 3D perception on
   real scenarios. The conventional stereopsis measurement is based on
   subjective judgment for stereograms, leading to be easily affected by
   personal consciousness. To alleviate the issue, in this paper, the EEG
   signals evoked by dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS) are collected
   for stereogram recognition, which can help the ophthalmologists diagnose
   strabismus patients even without real-time communication. To classify
   the collected Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, a novel multi-scale
   temporal self-attention and dynamical graph convolution hybrid network
   (MTS-DGCHN) is proposed, including multi-scale temporal self-attention
   module, dynamical graph convolution module and classification module.
   Firstly, the multi-scale temporal self-attention module is employed to
   learn time continuity information, where the temporal self-attention
   block is designed to highlight the global importance of each time
   segments in one EEG trial, and the multi-scale convolution block is
   developed to further extract advanced temporal features in multiple
   receptive fields. Meanwhile, the dynamical graph convolution module is
   utilized to capture spatial functional relationships between different
   EEG electrodes, in which the adjacency matrix of each GCN layer is
   adaptively tuned to explore the optimal intrinsic relationship. Finally,
   the temporal and spatial features are fed into the classification module
   to obtain prediction results. Extensive experiments are conducted on
   collected datasets i.e., SRDA and SRDB, and the results demonstrate the
   proposed MTS-DGCHN achieves outstanding classification performance
   compared with the other methods. The datasets are available at
   https://github.com/YANGeeg/TJU-SRD-datasets and the code is at

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have promoted the development of
   insulation defect diagnosis for gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) because
   of their excellent feature extraction and classification capabilities.
   However, CNN ignores the correlation between the local areas of the
   feature space, resulting in insufficient feature utilization. Moreover,
   deploying and applying the methods explored in massive laboratory data
   to complex and few-shot conditions on-site is a difficult problem
   currently. Therefore, this study proposes a novel domain adaptation
   graph convolutional network (DAGCN) for GIS insulation defect diagnosis.
   First, the graph signal and graph convolution network are used to take
   advantage of the correlation between the local areas of the feature
   space while employing the numerical characteristics of the insulation
   defect signal. Then, the learned diagnostic method is deployed to the
   on-site GIS insulation defect diagnosis with domain adaptive transfer
   learning (TL). The difference between the two tasks is reduced by
   minimizing the difference between the marginal and conditional
   distributions of the source and target domains, thus, realizing the
   feature migration. The experimental verification shows that DAGCN has
   higher diagnostic accuracy and robustness than traditional methods,
   especially in diagnosing few-shot on-site. It provides a reliable
   reference for high-precision and robust diagnosis of few-shot GIS
   insulation defect diagnosis.

AB Simple Summary Identifying cancer driver genes plays a significant role
   in cancer diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of
   next-generation sequencing technologies, a wealth of multi-omics cancer
   data, including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, are now
   available for cancer research. Integrating these data to effectively
   identify cancer driver genes causally associated with cancer is a
   computational challenge. Methods for identifying cancer driver genes are
   mainly based on population levels. Considering the trend of precision
   medicine and the heterogeneity of patients, it is challenging but
   crucial to identify cancer driver genes at the individual level. We
   developed a method called PDGCN (Personalized Drivers of GCN), which
   constructs sample-gene interaction networks by integrating multiple
   types of data features and using network structural features extracted
   from Node2vec. Then, a graphical convolutional neural network model with
   a conditional random field layer is used to prioritize candidate driver
   genes in the network. The results show that PDGCN can identify driver
   genes at the individual level, providing a new perspective for
   predicting driver genes in individual samples.Abstract Cancer is a
   complex and evolutionary disease mainly driven by the accumulation of
   genetic variations in genes. Identifying cancer driver genes is
   important. However, most related studies have focused on the population
   level. Cancer is a disease with high heterogeneity. Thus, the discovery
   of driver genes at the individual level is becoming more valuable but is
   a great challenge. Although there have been some computational methods
   proposed to tackle this challenge, few can cover all patient samples
   well, and there is still room for performance improvement. In this
   study, to identify individual-level driver genes more efficiently, we
   propose the PDGCN method. PDGCN integrates multiple types of data
   features, including mutation, expression, methylation, copy number data,
   and system-level gene features, along with network structural features
   extracted using Node2vec in order to construct a sample-gene interaction
   network. Prediction is performed using a graphical convolutional neural
   network model with a conditional random field layer, which is able to
   better combine the network structural features with biological attribute
   features. Experiments on the ACC (Adrenocortical Cancer) and KICH
   (Kidney Chromophobe) datasets from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)
   demonstrated that the method performs better compared to other similar
   methods. It can identify not only frequently mutated driver genes, but
   also rare candidate driver genes and novel biomarker genes. The results
   of the survival and enrichment analyses of these detected genes
   demonstrate that the method can identify important driver genes at the
   individual level.

AB Social recommendation leverages social information to alleviate data
   sparsity and cold-start issues of collaborative filtering (CF) methods.
   Most existing works model user interests following the assumption of
   social homophily based on social-relation data. The explicit modeling of
   social influence, which also largely affects user behaviors, has not
   been well explored. Considering user behaviors may be driven by social
   factors in today's information services (e.g., purchasing products
   shared by close friends on social e-commerce applications), these
   methods will be suboptimal. In this work, we propose a method modeling
   both social homophily-aware user interests and social influence as two
   essential effects on user behaviors for social recommendation, named as
   DISGCN (short for DISentangled modeling of Social homophily and
   influence with Graph Convolutional Network). Specifically, we devise a
   disentangled embedding layer to encode these two effects. Furthermore,
   two tailored graph convolutional layers are developed to disentangle
   them refinedly, leveraging the high-order embedding propagation in
   social-network graph from two aspects. Technically, first, the operation
   of attentive embedding propagation is adopted for capturing personalized
   social homophily-aware interests, and second, the item-gate-based
   embedding propagation is proposed for capturing item-specific social
   influence. In addition, to ensure the disentanglement of social
   influence, we propose a contrastive learning framework that endows
   corresponding embeddings with explicit semantics. Extensive experiments
   on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
   model. Further studies also verify the rationality and necessity of our
   designs. We have released the datasets and codes at this link:

AB Benefiting from the intuitiveness and naturalness of sketch interaction,
   sketch-based video retrieval (SBVR) has received considerable attention
   in the video retrieval research area. However, most existing SBVR
   research still lacks the capability of accurate video retrieval with
   fine-grained scene content. To address this problem, in this paper we
   investigate a new task, which focuses on retrieving the target video by
   utilizing a fine-grained storyboard sketch depicting the scene layout
   and major foreground instances' visual characteristics (e.g.,
   appearance, size, pose, etc.) of video; we call such a task
   "fine-grained scene-level SBVR". The most challenging issue in this task
   is how to perform scene-level cross-modal alignment between sketch and
   video. Our solution consists of two parts. First, we construct a
   scene-level sketch-video dataset called SketchVideo, in which
   sketch-video pairs are provided and each pair contains a clip-level
   storyboard sketch and several keyframe sketches (corresponding to video
   frames). Second, we propose a novel deep learning architecture called
   Sketch Query Graph Convolutional Network (SQ-GCN). In SQ-GCN, we first
   adaptively sample the video frames to improve video encoding efficiency,
   and then construct appearance and category graphs to jointly model
   visual and semantic alignment between sketch and video. Experiments show
   that our fine-grained scene-level SBVR framework with SQ-GCN
   architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art fine-grained retrieval
   methods. The SketchVideo dataset and SQ-GCN code are available in the
   project webpage https://iscas-mmsketch.github.io/FG-SL-SBVR/.

AB Graph theory analysis using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is
   currently an advanced technique for seizure prediction. Recent deep
   learning approaches, which fail to fully explore both the
   characterizations in EEGs themselves and correlations among different
   electrodes simultaneously, generally neglect the spatial or temporal
   dependencies in an epileptic brain and, thus, produce suboptimal seizure
   prediction performance consequently. To tackle this issue, in this
   article, a patient-specific EEG seizure predictor is proposed by using a
   novel spatio-temporal-spectral hierarchical graph convolutional network
   with an active preictal interval learning scheme (STS-HGCN-AL).
   Specifically, since the epileptic activities in different brain regions
   may be of different frequencies, the proposed STS-HGCN-AL framework
   first infers a hierarchical graph to concurrently characterize an
   epileptic cortex under different rhythms, whose temporal dependencies
   and spatial couplings are extracted by a spectral-temporal convolutional
   neural network and a variant self-gating mechanism, respectively.
   Critical intrarhythm spatiotemporal properties are then captured and
   integrated jointly and further mapped to the final recognition results
   by using a hierarchical graph convolutional network. Particularly, since
   the preictal transition may be diverse from seconds to hours prior to a
   seizure onset among different patients, our STS-HGCN-AL scheme estimates
   an optimal preictal interval patient dependently via a semisupervised
   active learning strategy, which further enhances the robustness of the
   proposed patient-specific EEG seizure predictor. Competitive
   experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method in
   extracting critical preictal biomarkers, indicating its promising
   abilities in automatic seizure prediction.

AB The continuous improvement of the cyber threat intelligence sharing
   mechanism provides new ideas to deal with Advanced Persistent dures
   (TTP) from Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can facilitate APT actors???
   profiling for an immediate response. However, it is difficult for
   traditional manual methods to analyze attack behaviors from cyber threat
   intelligence due to its heterogeneous nature. Based on the Adversarial
   Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) of threat behavior
   description, this paper proposes a threat behavioral knowledge
   extraction framework that integrates Heterogeneous Text Network (HTN)
   and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to solve this issue. It leverages
   the hierarchical correlation relationships of attack techniques and
   tactics in the ATT&CK to construct a text network of heterogeneous cyber
   threat intelligence. With the help of the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representation from Transformers (BERT) pretraining model to analyze the
   contextual semantics of cyber threat intelligence, the task of threat
   behavior identification is transformed into a text classification task,
   which automatically extracts attack behavior in CTI, then identifies the
   malware and advanced threat actors. The experimental results show that
   F1 achieve 94.86% and 92.15% for the multi-label classification tasks of
   tactics and techniques. Extend the experiment to verify the method???s
   effectiveness in identifying the malware and threat actors in APT
   attacks. The F1 for malware and advanced threat actors identification
   task reached 98.45% and 99.48%, which are better than the benchmark
   model in the experiment and achieve state of the art. The model can
   effectively model threat intelligence text features with a priori
   knowledge to compensate for insufficient sample data and improve the
   classification performance and recognition ability of threat behavior in
   text.

   scientific research topics. The existing topic trend prediction methods
   have proved that the research topic trend of a publication is influenced
   by other peer publications. However, they ignore the fact that the
   research topics of different publications belong to different research
   topic space. Moreover, the existing topic prediction methods do not
   fully consider the interactive influence among publications that the
   research topic of one publication affects the topics of other
   publications, it is also influenced by the research topics of other
   publications. In line with this, this paper proposes a scientific
   research topic trend prediction model based on multi-long short-term
   memory (multi-LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Network. Specifically,
   multiple LSTMs are employed to map research topics of different
   publications into their respective topic space. Then, the graph
   convolutional neural network is applied to learn the scientific
   influence context of each publication, so that the research topic of
   each publication not only integrates the influence of neighbor nodes,
   but also considers the influence of the neighbors of the neighbor node
   on the research topic of the publication, so as to more accurately fuse
   scientific influence context of research topic of peer publications.
   Experiments results on the data set of scientific research papers in the
   field of artificial intelligence and data mining demonstrate that the
   model improves the prediction precision and achieves the
   state-of-the-art research topic trend prediction effect compared with
   the other baseline models.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) methods play an essential role in
   hyperspectral classification. However, the massive parameters and vast
   computing overhead of DNN needs to be reduced when facing the deployment
   with limited storage and computing resources for real-time response
   applications, especially considering the high dimensionality of
   hyperspectral image. So, applying dimension reduction (DR) methods is a
   crucial pre-processing method in various studies. Still, most of them
   ignore the feature restoration after the data transformation by DR. In
   neural networks, many works still involve sophisticated skip connections
   and dense feature reuse, which can lead to feature redundancy and
   increase computational complexity, especially when DR methods have been
   applied first. Motivated by these issues, an efficient joint framework
   assisted by embedded feature smoother (FS) and sparse skip connection
   (SSC) is proposed in this article. Instead of directly feeding DR data
   into the subsequent network, we embedded a computing-cheap FS based on
   isotropic total variation to restore and enhance the spatial features.
   Furthermore, we proposed a SSC 3D convolution neural network to complete
   spatial-spectral feature representation and classification. The SSC is
   embodied in the design of log2n-skip connection to concatenate feature
   maps instead of dense connection, pruning the number of channels and
   reducing the model parameters. Experimental results show that the
   embedded FS significantly improves classification accuracy and is
   superior to other processing methods. Our framework offers much superior
   to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods considering
   classification performance and lightweight aspects, especially when
   using few training samples. Moreover, considering detailed processing
   steps, our framework has a competitively cheaper time consumption.

AB In order to address the problem of air pollution along with the fast
   development of the economy and an increase of urban population, this
   paper aims to capture the spatial-temporal correlation in air quality
   data and improve the prediction accuracy of -PM2.5 concentration.
   Existing models usually neglect the correlation in temporal and spatial
   dimensions, and the prediction results do not correspond to those in
   practical applications. We propose a multi-period spatial-temporal graph
   convolutional network (MST-GCN), in which the time division module fully
   explores the temporal correlation within the data and builds separate
   models for different time periods; the spatial-temporal convolution
   module captures the characteristics of historical data in the time
   dimension and spatial dimension, in which GCN is used to learn spatial
   dependencies between stations, and CNN is applied to learn the temporal
   dependencies of adjacent time points; meanwhile, a spatial-temporal
   attention mechanism module is introduced to enhance the key information
   in different dimensions, thereby capturing the spatialtemporal dynamic
   correlation. Finally, the experiments with real air quality data from
   Beijing monitoring stations show that the time division method is
   effective to extract the features in time dimensions; therefore, the
   model is able to capture the characteristics and dynamic correlation of
   air quality data in spatial- temporal dimensions. The superiority of the
   proposed method has been validated over state-of-the-art methods, and
   the average mean absolute error and root-mean-square error of MST-GCN
   are 34.37 and 35.55, respectively, which achieves the best performance
   in the experiments.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success in
   processing non-Euclidean data. GCNs update the feature representations
   of each sample by aggregating the structure information from K-order
   (layer) neighborhood samples. Existing GCNs variants rely heavily on the
   K-th layer semantic information with K-order neighborhood informa-tion
   aggregating. However, semantic features from different convolution
   layers have dis-tinct sample attributes. The single-layer semantic
   feature is only a one-sided feature representation. Besides, the
   semantic features of traditional GCNs will be oversmoothing with
   multi-layer structure information aggregates. In this paper, to solve
   the above -mentioned problem, we propose adaptive graph convolutional
   collaboration networks (AGCCNs) for the semi-supervised classification
   task. AGCCNs can fully use the different scales of discrimination
   information contained in the different convolutional layers.
   Specifically, AGCCNs utilize the attention mechanism to learn the
   relevance (contribution) coefficient of the deep semantic features from
   different convolution layers for the task, which aims to effectively
   discriminant their importance. After multiple optimizations, AGCCNs can
   adaptively learn the robust deep semantic features via the effective
   semantic fusion process between multi-layer semantic information.
   Compared with GCNs that only utilize the K-th layer semantic features,
   AGCCNs make the learned deep semantic features contain richer and more
   robust semantic information. What is more, our proposed AGCCNs can
   aggregate the appropriate K-order neighborhood information for each
   sample, which can relieve the oversmoothing issue of traditional GCNs
   and better generalize shallow GCNs to more deep layers. Abundant
   experimental results on several popular datasets demonstrate the
   superiority of our proposed AGCCNs compared with traditional GCNs. (c)

AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes acquired
   immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), one of the most devastating diseases
   affecting humankind. Here, we have proposed a framework to examine the
   differences among microarray gene expression data of uninfected and
   three different HIV-1 infection stages using module preservation
   statistics. We leverage the advantage of gene co-expression networks
   (GCN) constructed for each infection stages to detect the topological
   and structural changes of a group of differentially expressed genes. We
   examine the relationship among a set of co-expression modules by
   constructing a module eigengene network considering the overall
   similarity/dissimilarity among the genes within the modules. We have
   utilized different module preservation statistics with two composite
   statistics: "Zsummary" and "MedianRank" to examine the changes in
   co-expression patterns between modules. We have found several
   interesting results on the preservation characteristics of gene modules
   across different stages. Some genes are identified to be preserved in a
   pair of stages while altering their characteristics across other stages.
   We further validated the obtained results using permutation test and
   classification techniques. The biological significances of the obtained
   modules have also been examined using gene ontology and pathway-based
   analysis. Additionally, we have identified a set of key immune
   regulatory hub genes in the associated protein-protein interaction
   networks (PPINs) of the differentially expressed (DE) genes, which
   interacts with HIV-1 proteins and are likely to act as potential
   biomarkers in HIV-1 progression.

   Revision of the type species of Protocalymene, P. mcallisteri Ross,

   indicates that it is not a calymenine, and that while it is clearly a
   calymenoidean its close affinity is otherwise difficult to determine. A
   single genuine calymenine species is known from the Laurentian
   Dapingian, and revised here as "Calymeninae n. gen.? n. sp. A" from the

AB Type II toxin-antitoxins systems are widespread in prokaryotic genomes.
   Typically, they comprise two proteins, a toxin, and an antitoxin,
   encoded by adjacent genes and forming a complex in which the enzymatic
   activity of the toxin is inhibited. Under stress conditions, the
   antitoxin is degraded liberating the active toxin. Though thousands of
   various toxin-antitoxins pairs have been predicted bioinformatically,
   only a handful has been thoroughly characterized. Here, we describe the
   AtaT2 toxin from a toxin-antitoxin system from Escherichia coli O157:H7.
   We show that AtaT2 is the first GNAT (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase)
   toxin that specifically targets charged glycyl tRNA. In vivo, the AtaT2
   activity induces ribosome stalling at all four glycyl codons but does
   not evoke a stringent response. In vitro, AtaT2 acetylates the aminoacyl
   moiety of isoaccepting glycyl tRNAs, thus precluding their participation
   in translation. Our study broadens the known target specificity of GNAT
   toxins beyond the earlier described isoleucine and formylmethionine
   tRNAs, and suggest that various GNAT toxins may have evolved to
   specificaly target other if not all individual aminoacyl tRNAs.

AB The truss structural optimization is a major research topic in the field
   of structural, civil, aerospace engineering, etc. Conventionally, the
   truss structural optimization methods are often inefficient because they
   run in iterations and are computationally intensive during each
   iteration. In this paper, we propose a generative design framework based
   on deep learning networks to predict three dimensional structural
   topologies without iterative computations while achieving acceptable
   accuracy. Different from most commonly used deep learning driven
   structural optimization approaches that transform structural geometries
   into images, our innovation lies in solving optimization problems based
   on geometric analysis from the perspective of graphs, and efficiently
   predict the near optimal truss structure with a negligible computational
   time. Therefore, it shows potential significance in design scenarios
   when the structure is described by connections and massive number of
   optimization computations are required. The proposed generative design
   framework is called TSO-GCN (Truss Structural Optimization -Graph
   Convolutional Network), which is an encoder-decoder based graph
   convolution network designed to map the problem definition and the
   desired truss layout. Once trained, it is expected to directly predict
   truss layouts by feeding into the encoded optimization problem
   definitions. To train the TSO-GCN, a dataset consisting of different
   number of problem definitions and their corresponding minimum volume
   results generated by conventional methods is constructed and fed into
   the network. The experiments show that TSO-GCN can predict results with
   the near optimal accuracy compared with conventional approaches while
   costing an average time of only 1 s. Besides, extra experiments with
   totally unseen dataset are performed to demonstrate the generalizability
   of the proposed method.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB More recently, vision transformer (ViT) has shown competitive
   performance with convolutional neural network (CNN) on computer vision
   tasks, which provided more possibilities for accurate classification of
   hyperspectral image (HSI). However, whether CNN or ViT, they generally
   only focus on single type of feature, resulting in insufficient
   information utilization. For instance, CNN has powerful local feature
   extraction ability, while ViT pays more attention to long-range
   dependencies and global features. To consider multiple types of feature
   information, we propose a multiple vision architectures-based hybrid
   network (MVAHN) for HSI classification, which consists of joint CNN and
   transformer (JCT) structure and graph convolutional module (GCM).
   Firstly, JCT successfully embeds convolution operations into ViT to
   capture local and global features, which mainly include: 1) A spectral
   spatial convolution block (SSCB) is proposed to unearth local spectral
   spatial features. 2) A convolution embedding is aggregated into
   self-attention to design a local-global attention (LGA) mechanism, which
   can realize the seamless integration of CNN and ViT, thereby capturing
   local-global combined features. Secondly, a plug-and-play GCM is
   developed in parallel with transformer encoders to further improve the
   model classification ability by mining the similarity relationship
   between pixels in HSI. Overall, an elegant integration of these
   seemingly distinct paradigms is realized by MVAHN to capture multiple
   types of feature information. The overall accuracies (OAs) of MVAHN on
   Pavia University, Houston 2013, Salinas Valley, Kennedy Space Center,
   Indian Pines and Botswana datasets are 96.37%, 88.33%, 97.57%, 98.96%,
   96.25% and 99.26%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art
   hybrid models, MVAHN achieves competitive classification results. The

AB Deep learning (DL) methods are promising for the multilabel aerial image
   classification (MAIC) task. However, current DL methods face a common
   problem: the need for large multilabeled datasets. Collecting and
   annotating raw aerial image datasets can be extremely time- and
   labor-consuming. To address this concern in MAIC, domain adaptation (DA)
   provides a novel solution by transferring the knowledge learned from a
   label-rich dataset (i.e., the source domain) to a label-scarce dataset
   (i.e., the target domain), while current DA models are mainly designed
   for single-labeled tasks. In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end
   MAIC model based on DA techniques, named DA-MAIC. To the best of our
   knowledge, this article for the first time integrates DA to tackle the
   label scarcity problem in the MAIC task. Specifically, the proposed
   DA-MAIC is composed of two main parts: the image classifier and the
   domain classifier. The image classifier captures task-discriminative
   features based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) to predict
   multiple image labels; and the domain classifier extracts
   domain-invariant representations, which mitigates the domain shift
   between two underlying distributions. We extensively evaluate the
   proposed DA-MAIC from different perspectives on three benchmark
   datasets, including the commonly used UCM dataset, the high-resolution
   AID dataset, and the recently proposed DFC15 dataset. Both quantitative
   and qualitative results support that the proposed DA-MAIC can generalize
   the source domain knowledge to new scenarios and substantially improve
   the classification performance on the target domain task.

AB In this paper, we propose a GraphBit method to learn unsupervised deep
   binary descriptors for efficient image representation. Conventional
   binary representation learning methods directly quantize each element
   according to the threshold without considering the quantization
   ambiguousness. The elements near the boundary dubbed as "ambiguous bits
   " fail to collect effective information for reliable binarization and
   are sensitive to noise that causes reversed bits. We argue that there
   are implicit inner relationships among bits in binary descriptors called
   bitwise interaction, where the related bits can provide extra
   instruction as prior knowledge for ambiguousness reduction.
   Specifically, we design a deep reinforcement learning model to learn the
   structure of the graph for bitwise interaction mining, and the
   uncertainty of binary codes is reduced by maximizing the mutual
   information with input and related bits. Consequently, the ambiguous
   bits receive additional instruction from the graph for reliable
   binarization. Moreover, we further present a differentiable search
   method (GraphBit+) that mines the bitwise interaction in continuous
   space, so that the heavy search cost caused by the training difficulties
   in reinforcement learning is significantly reduced. Since the GraphBit
   and GraphBit+ methods learn fixed bitwise interaction which is
   suboptimal for various input, the inaccurate instruction from the fixed
   bitwise interaction cannot effectively decrease the ambiguousness of
   binary descriptors. To address this, we further propose the unsupervised
   binary descriptor learning method via dynamic bitwise interaction mining
   (D-GraphBit), where a graph convolutional network called GraphMiner
   reasons the optimal bitwise interaction for each input sample. Extensive
   experimental results on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, ImageNet-100, Brown and
   HPatches datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the
   proposed GraphBit, GraphBit+ and D-GraphBit.

AB Motivation: Mining drug-disease association and related interactions are
   essential for developing in silico drug repurposing (DR) methods and
   understanding underlying biological mechanisms. Recently, large-scale
   biological databases are increasingly available for pharmaceutical
   research, allowing for deep characterization for molecular informatics
   and drug discovery. However, DR is challenging due to the molecular
   heterogeneity of disease and diverse drug-disease associations.
   Importantly, the complexity of molecular target interactions, such as
   protein-protein interaction (PPI), remains to be elucidated. DR thus
   requires deep exploration of a multimodal biological network in an
   integrative context.
   Results: In this study, we propose BiFusion, a bipartite graph
   convolution network model for DR through heterogeneous information
   fusion. Our approach combines insights of multiscale pharmaceutical
   information by constructing a multirelational graph of drug-protein,
   disease-protein and PPIs. Especially, our model introduces protein nodes
   as a bridge for message passing among diverse biological domains, which
   provides insights into utilizing PPI for improved DR assessment. Unlike
   conventional graph convolution networks always assuming the same node
   attributes in a global graph, our approach models interdomain
   information fusion with bipartite graph convolution operation. We
   offered an exploratory analysis for finding novel drug-disease
   associations. Extensive experiments showed that our approach achieved
   improved performance than multiple baselines for DR analysis.

AB Background Non-germinal center B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
   (non-GCB-DLBCL) has worse clinical outcome than GCB-DLBCL, and some
   relapsed/refractory non-GCB-DLBCL (R/R non-GCB-DLBCL) are even resistant
   to CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). Bruton's tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors (BTKis) are new drugs for B-cell lymphoma. BTKis can promote
   apoptosis of DLBCL by inactivating nuclear transcription factor kappa B
   (NF kappa B) signaling pathway. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a tumor
   suppressor and ubiquitinase. CYLD can inactivate NF kappa B signaling
   pathway through ubiquitination and regulate the apoptosis of
   hematological tumors. The ubiquitination of CYLD can be regulated by
   phosphorylation, suggesting that the regulation of CYLD phosphorylation
   can be a potential mechanism to promote the apoptosis of hematological
   tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that BTKis could promote the
   apoptosis of non-GCB-DLBCL by regulating the phosphorylation of CYLD,
   especially in rituximab resistant cases, and we proved this hypothesis
   through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Methods The baseline
   expression levels of CYLD phosphorylation in non-GCB-DLBCL patients and
   cell lines were detected by Western Blotting. The non-GCB-DLBCL cell
   lines were treated with BTKis, and apoptosis induced by BTKis treatment
   was detected by Western blotting, cell viability assay and Annexin V
   assay. To verify whether the effect of BTKis on apoptosis in
   non-GCN-DLBCL cells is CYLD dependent, the expression of CYLD was
   knocked down by lentiviral shRNAs. To verify the effect of BTKis on the
   phosphorylation of CYLD and the apoptosis in vivo and in rituximab
   resistant non-GCB-DLBCL, the xeograft model and rituximab resistant
   non-GCB-DLBCL cells were generated by tumor cell inoculation and
   escalation of drug concentrations, respectively. Results BTKis induced
   apoptosis by down-regulating CYLD phosphorylationin in non GCB-DLBCL,
   xenograft mouse model, and rituximab-resistant cells, and this effect
   could be enhanced by rituximab. Knocking-down CYLD reversed apoptosis
   which was induced by BTKis. BTKis induced CYLD-dependent apoptosis in
   non-GCB-DLBCL including in rituximab-resistant cells. Conclusions The
   present results indicated that CYLD phosphorylation is a potential
   clinical therapeutic target for non-GCB-DLBCL, especially for
   rituximab-resistant relapsed/refractory cases.

AB As an emerging concept, Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) aims to provide
   on-demand content-based (data, information, knowledge) delivery to meet
   the needs of users. With the prosperity of knowledge services, the
   prediction of the usage tendency of knowledge services has become an
   important and timely research topic. This study focuses on speculating
   the possible popularity of knowledge services in the next period of
   time, which can assist other downstream service tasks such as service
   recommendations. The interactions among knowledge services and their
   rich information (such as historical usage observation and text
   information) provide grounding for predicting the usage trend of
   services. However, recent spatial-temporal prediction based on graph
   neural networks usually depends heavily on the quality of manually
   created graphs, which may be expensive for knowledge services. To tackle
   such a limitation, this article proposes a novel Multi-modal Reciprocal
   SpatioTemporal (MRST) framework, which can jointly mine spatial
   dependencies and model time patterns for spatiotemporal coupling
   prediction. Two types of Edge Inference Networks (called EIN-o and
   EIN-t) are designed to sufficiently discover the spatial dependencies
   among knowledge services based on the data of usage observation
   sequences and service descriptions, respectively, and generate
   multi-modal directed weighted knowledge service graphs. Based on these
   graphs, MRST integrates GCN-based spatiotemporal prediction models as
   backbones to make predictions. Particularly, MRST features a unique
   reciprocal framework. On the one hand, EINs infer and generate
   multi-modal graphs to serve GCNs; on the other hand, GCNs utilize such
   spatial dependencies to make predictions and then introduce feedback to
   optimize EINs. In the meantime, to facilitate reproducible research, we
   collect a new knowledge service dataset from Wikipedia called Wiki-EN
   dataset. Experiments on this real data set show that the proposed MRST
   framework significantly surpasses the baselines and can learn meaningful
   spatial dependencies outside the predefined graphic structure.

AB Dynamic vision sensors (event cameras) have recently been introduced to
   solve a number of different vision tasks such as object recognition,
   activities recognition, tracking, etc. Compared with the traditional RGB
   sensors, the event cameras have many unique advantages such as ultra low
   resources consumption, high temporal resolution and much larger dynamic
   range. However, these cameras only produce noisy and asynchronous events
   of intensity changes, i.e., event-streams rather than frames, where
   conventional computer vision algorithms can't be directly applied. In
   our opinion the key challenge for improving the performance of event
   cameras in vision tasks is finding the appropriate representations of
   the event-streams so that cutting-edge learning approaches can be
   applied to fully uncover the spatio-temporal information contained in
   the event-streams. In this paper, we focus on the event-based human gait
   identification task and investigate the possible representations of the
   event-streams when deep neural networks are applied as the classifier.
   We propose new event-based gait recognition approaches basing on two
   different representations of the event-stream, i.e., graph and
   image-like representations, and use graph-based convolutional network
   (GCN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) respectively to recognize
   gait from the event-streams. The two approaches are termed as
   EV-Gait-3DGraph and EV-Gait-IMG. To evaluate the performance of the
   proposed approaches, we collect two event-based gait datasets, one from
   real-world experiments and the other by converting the publicly
   available RGB gait recognition benchmark CASIA-B. Extensive experiments
   show that EV-Gait-3DGraph achieves significantly higher recognition
   accuracy than other competing methods when sufficient training samples
   are available. However, EV-Gait-IMG converges more quickly than
   graph-based approaches while training and shows good accuracy with only
   few number of training samples (less than ten). So image-like
   presentation is preferable when the amount of training data is limited.

AB Malaria is a serious and fatal infectious disease and early detection of
   the patient's infection severity can effectively curb the outbreak of
   this infectious disease. Deep learning has been verified to have
   excellent capability in image classification and disease diagnosis in
   many challenging tasks, such as cell detection and histological image
   classification. There exist many deep learning researches on malaria
   parasite recognition with successful applications, but they mainly focus
   on binary classification of single Ring stage and red blood cells. The
   most important disadvantage of them are ignoring other stages of malaria
   parasites, including Trophozoite, Gametocytes, and Schizont. In this
   paper, we are the first to study the multi-stage malaria parasite
   recognition problem, and propose a novel Neighbor Correlated Graph
   Convolutional Network (NCGCN) for this challenging task. Specifically,
   NCGCN consists of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) feature learning,
   neighbor correlation mining, and graph representation modules. The
   method firstly extracts CNN representations from each parasite image and
   then establishes the neighbor correlations among CNN features by
   combining K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and epsilon-radius graph building
   algorithms, with operating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on CNN
   features and their correlations. To evaluate the performance of our
   NCGCN model, we compare it with several advanced existing methods, and
   our model can reach a high Accuracy of 94.17%, Precision of 94.84%,
   Recall of 94.17% and F1-score of 94.20%. The comparison with these
   outstanding methods verifies the NCGCN model has an excellent capability
   for recognizing multi-stage malaria parasites, which is higher than the
   compared methods at least 8.67% in Accuracy.

AB Human segmentation and tracking (HS-T) in the video often utilize person
   detection results. In addition, 3D human pose estimation (3D-HPE) and
   human activity recognition (HAR) often use human segmentation results to
   reduce data storage and computational time. With recent advantages of
   deep learning, especially using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
   there are excellent results in these relevant tasks. Consequently, they
   can be applied to building many practical applications such as sports
   analysis, sports scoring, health protection, teaching, and preserving
   traditional martial arts. In this paper, we performed a survey of
   relevant studies, methods, datasets, and results for HS-T, 3D-HPE, and
   HAR. We also deeply analyze the results of detecting persons as it
   affects the results of human segmentation and human tracking. The survey
   is performed in great detail up to source code paths. The MADS (Martial
   Arts, Dancing, and Sports) dataset comprises fast and complex
   activities. It has been published for the task of estimating human pose.
   However, before determining the human pose, the person needs to be
   detected as a segment in the video, especially the 3D human pose
   annotation data is different from the point cloud data generated from
   RGB-D images. Therefore, we have also prepared 2D human pose annotation
   data on the 28k images for creating 3D human pose annotation and action
   labeling data. Moreover, we also evaluated the MADS dataset with many
   recently published deep learning methods for human segmentation (Mask
   R-CNN, PointRend, TridentNet, TensorMask, and CenterMask) and tracking,
   3D-HPE (RepNet, MediaPipe Pose, and Lifting from the Deep, V2V-PoseNet),
   and HAR (ST-GCN, DD-net, and PA-GesGCN) in the video. All data and

AB Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset, primarily
   autosomal dominant disease caused by a short GCN expansion in the PABPN1
   (polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1) gene that results in an
   alanine expansion at the N terminus of the PABPN1 protein. Expression of
   alanine-expanded PABPN1 is linked to the formation of nuclear aggregates
   in tissues from individuals with OPMD. However, as with other nuclear
   aggregate-associated diseases, controversy exists over whether these
   aggregates are the direct cause of pathology. An emerging hypothesis is
   that a loss of PABPN1 function and/or aberrant protein interactions
   contribute to pathology in OPMD. Here, we present the first global
   proteomic analysis of the protein interactions of WT and
   alanine-expanded PABPN1 in skeletal muscle tissue. These data provide
   both insight into the function of PABPN1 in muscle and evidence that the
   alanine expansion alters the protein-protein interactions of PABPN1. We
   extended this analysis to demonstrate altered complex formation with and
   loss of function of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), which we show
   interacts with alanine-expanded but not WT PABPN1. The results from our
   study support a model where altered protein interactions with
   alanine-expanded PABPN1 that lead to loss or gain of function could
   contribute to pathology in OPMD.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have drawn attention for
   skeleton-based action recognition. They have achieved remarkable
   performance by adaptively learning spatial features of human action
   dynamics. However, the existing methods are limited in temporal sequence
   modelling of human actions. To give adequate consideration to temporal
   factors in action modelling, a novel temporal-enhanced graph convolution
   network is presented. First, a Causal Convolution layer is introduced to
   ensure no future information leakage at each time step for keeping
   ordering information of inputs. Second, a novel cross-spatial-temporal

AB This letter proposes a new travel time estimation model based on graph
   neural network (GraphTTE) to improve the accuracy of travel time
   estimation. We design a Multi-layer Spatiotemporal Graph frame (MSG),
   which consists of static network and dynamic networks, to fully consider
   the influence of traffic temporal characteristics and road network
   topological characteristics on travel time. Moreover, we design an
   Attention Graph Nodes Impact Index algorithm (AGNII) to score the impact
   of each node on travel time. In particular, the dynamic networks utilize
   the graph convolution network and gate recurrent unit to obtain the
   traffic characteristics, the static network utilizes graph convolution
   network to obtain the road basic attributes. We combine the real paths
   sequence with the impact score of nodes to extract the subgraph with a
   great impact on the trajectory. After the graph representation learning
   and deep residual network, the estimated time is obtained. A simulator
   was designed to train and test our model in Chengdu and Xi'an datasets,
   the results show that the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) is 12.58%
   and 14.01%, which is 1.54% and 1.78% lower than the baselines.

AB For a class F of complex-valued functions on a set D, we denote by gn(F)
   its sampling numbers, i.e., the minimal worst-case error on F, measured
   in L2, that can be achieved with a recovery algorithm based on n
   function evaluations. We prove that there is a universal constant c is
   an element of N such that, if F is the unit ball of a separable
   reproducing kernel Hilbert space, then gcn(F)2 <= 1 E n k >= n dk(F )2,
   where dk(F) are the Kolmogorov widths (or approximation numbers) of F in
   L2. We also obtain similar upper bounds for more general classes F,
   including all compact subsets of the space of continuous functions on a
   bounded domain D subset of Rd, and show that these bounds are sharp by
   providing examples where the converse inequality holds up to a constant.
   The results rely on the solution to the Kadison-Singer problem, which we
   extend to the subsampling of a sum of infinite rank-one matrices. (c)

AB Landmark localization is an important step in quantifying
   craniomaxillofacial (CMF) deformities and designing treatment plans of
   reconstructive surgery. However, due to the severity of deformities and
   defects (partially missing anatomy), it is difficult to automatically
   and accurately localize a large set of landmarks simultaneously. In this
   work, we propose two cascaded networks for digitizing 60 anatomical CMF
   landmarks in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. The first
   network is a U-Net that outputs heatmaps for landmark locations and
   landmark features extracted with a local attention mechanism. The second
   network is a graph convolution network that takes the features extracted
   by the first network as input and determines whether each landmark
   exists via binary classification. We evaluated our approach on 50 sets
   of CBCT scans of patients with CMF deformities and compared them with
   state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that our approach can
   achieve an average detection error of 1.47mm with a false positive rate
   of 19%, outperforming related methods.

AB With the growing demands on green short life-cycle products, advanced
   energy-aware process planning (AEPP) becomes critical. A major
   limitation of the existing methods is the poor resistance to the
   perturbations encountered in advanced machining systems. Therefore, a
   graph convolutional reinforcement learning (GCRL) method is proposed to
   overcome such limitations. In this method, a graph convolutional policy
   network is trained to rapidly adapt the learned commonalities to
   specific tasks. Unlike algorithms that fix decision variables before
   optimization, this method employs graph generation to represent AEPP
   while taking into consideration the flexibilities of operations,
   machines, and cutting tools. The problem is reformulated as a novel
   Markov decision process (MDP) to describe the dynamic generation
   procedure of process plans. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is
   concurrently used to perform graph embedding to compress the topology of
   input graphs. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to
   achieve robust and intuitive learning for process planning. To improve
   the adaption performance of the proposed GCRL, a two-phase multitask
   training strategy is adopted. Learning efficiency is improved because
   agents can incorporate both intertask similarities and task-specific
   rules. A comprehensive case study, including energy characteristics and
   algorithm performance analyses, is also performed to validate the
   developed method.

AB Air pollution is a lethal global threat. To mitigate the effects of air
   pollution, we must first understand it, find its patterns and
   correlations, and predict it in advance. Air pollution is highly
   dependent on spatial and temporal correlations of prior meteorological,
   wildfire, and pollution structures. We use the advanced deep predictive
   Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model paired with the cutting-edge Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture to predict spatiotemporal
   hourly PM2.5 across the Los Angeles area over time. Our deep-learning
   model does not use atmospheric physics or chemical mechanism data, but
   rather multisource imagery and sensor data. We use high-resolution
   remote-sensing satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the NASA Terra+Aqua
   satellites and remote-sensing data from the Tropospheric Monitoring
   Instrument (TROPOMI), a multispectral imaging spectrometer onboard the
   Sentinel-5P satellite. We use the highly correlated Fire Radiative Power
   data product from the MODIS instrument which provides valuable
   information about the radiant heat output and effects of wildfires on
   atmospheric air pollutants. The input data we use in our deep-learning
   model is representative of the major sources of ground-level PM2.5 and
   thus we can predict hourly PM2.5 at unparalleled accuracies. Our RMSE
   and NRMSE scores over various site locations and predictive time frames
   show significant improvement over existing research in predicting PM2.5
   using spatiotemporal deep predictive algorithms.

AB Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in females, with more
   than 450,000 deaths each year worldwide. Among the subtypes of breast
   cancer, basal-like breast cancer, also known as triple-negative breast
   cancer, shows the lowest survival rate and does not have effective
   treatments yet. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene frequently occur
   across all breast cancer subtypes, but comparative analysis of gene
   correlations with respect to mutations in TP53 has not been done so far.
   The primary goal of this study is to identify gene correlations in two
   groups of breast cancer patients and to derive potential prognostic gene
   pairs for breast cancer. We partitioned breast cancer patients into two
   groups: one group with a mutated TP53 gene (mTP53) and the other with a
   wild-type TP53 gene (wtTP53). For every gene pair, we computed the
   hazard ratio using the Cox proportional hazard model and constructed
   gene correlation networks (GCNs) enriched with prognostic information.
   Our GCN is more informative than typical GCNs in the sense that it
   indicates the type of correlation between genes, the concordance index,
   and the prognostic type of a gene. Comparative analysis of correlation
   patterns and survival time of the two groups revealed several
   interesting findings. First, we found several new gene pairs with
   opposite correlations in the two GCNs and the difference in their
   correlation patterns was the most prominent in the basal-like subtype of
   breast cancer. Second, we obtained potential prognostic genes for breast
   cancer patients with a wild-type TP53 gene. From a comparative analysis
   of GCNs of mTP53 and wtTP53, we found several gene pairs that show
   significantly different correlation patterns in the basal-like breast
   cancer subtype and obtained prognostic genes for patients with a
   wild-type TP53 gene. The GCNs and prognostic genes identified in this
   study will be informative for the prognosis of survival and for
   selecting a drug target for breast cancer, in particular for basal-like
   breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
   to construct GCNs for breast cancer patients with or without mutations
   in the TP53 gene and to find prognostic genes accordingly.

AB Lung cancer causes the highest mortality in cancer-related deaths. As
   these cancers often become resistant to existing therapies, definition
   of novel molecular targets is needed. Epigenetic modifiers may provide
   such targets. Recent reports suggest that the histone acetyltransferase
   (HAT) module within the transcriptional coactivator SAGA complex plays a
   role in cancer, creating a new link between epigenetic regulators and
   this disease. GCN5 serves as a coactivator for MYC target genes, and
   here we investigate links between GCN5 and c-MYC in non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC). Our data indicate that both GCN5 and c-MYC proteins are
   upregulated in mouse and human NSCLC cells compared to normal lung
   epithelial cells. This trend is observable only at the protein level,
   indicating that this upregulation occurs post-transcriptionally. Human
   NSCLC tissue data provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicates
   that GCN5 and c-MYC expression are positively associated with one
   another and with the expression of c-MYC target genes. Depletion of GCN5
   in NSCLC cells reduces c-MYC expression, cell proliferation, and
   increases the population of necrotic cells. Similarly, inhibition of the
   GCN5 catalytic site using a commercially available probe reduces c-MYC
   expression, cell proliferation, and increases the percentage of cells
   undergoing apoptosis. Our findings suggest that GCN5 might provide a
   novel target for inhibition of NSCLC growth and progression.

AB Objectives We examined the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX)
   maintenance therapy for patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic
   antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) in Japan. Methods We
   conducted a retrospective study using a multi-center cohort database of
   vasculitis patients. All maintenance treatment courses were divided into
   three groups: a RTX group, a group treated with other immunosuppressant
   drugs (IS) and a group receiving glucocorticoid monotherapy (GC). The
   primary endpoint was the comparison of relapse-free survival after 1
   year. We also analyzed the occurrence of severe adverse events (SAEs) to
   assess safety. Results We included 123 courses of 107 patients (RTXn =
   14, ISn = 64, GCn = 45). Twelve of 14 in the RTX group patients were
   diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The relapse-free
   survival of RTX maintenance therapy was comparable to that in the other
   groups (p = .122). After 1 year of treatment, the RTX group was
   administered lower steroid doses and one-third of them could withdraw
   corticosteroid. The overall incidence of SAE was 0.54/patient-year in
   the RTX group, 0.39/patient-year in the IS group and 0.34/patient-year
   in the GC group. Conclusion RTX maintenance therapy could be effective
   and safe in Japanese GPA patients.

AB Water and energy are key sustainability issues that need to be
   addressed. Photocatalysis represents an attractive means to not only
   remediate polluted waters, but also harness solar energy. Unfortunately,
   the employment of photocatalysts remains a practical challenge in terms
   of high cost, low efficiency, secondary pollution and unexploited water
   matrices influence. This study investigated the feasibility of
   photocatalysis to both treat water and produce hydrogen with practical
   water systems. Polymeric carbon nitride foam (CNF) with large surface
   area and mesoporous structure was successfully prepared via the
   bubble-template effect of ammonium chloride decomposition during thermal
   condensation. The reaction kinetics, mechanisms, and effect of natural
   water matrices and wastewater on CNF-based photocatalytic removal of
   tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) were systematically investigated.
   Furthermore, the efficiency of clean hydrogen energy from natural water
   matrices and wastewater was also evaluated. It was found that the
   photocatalytic performance of CNF for TC-HCl removal was principally
   affected by calcination temperature in the presence of NH4Cl. The
   degradation rates of CNF-4 (calcined at 550 degrees C) were
   approximately 1.84, 2.49 and 7.47 times than that of the CNF-2 (calcined
   at 600 degrees C), CNF-1 (calcined at 500 degrees C) and GCN (without
   NH4Cl), respectively. Results indicate that the improved photocatalytic
   performance was predominantly ascribed to the large specific surface
   area, increased availability of exposed active sites, and enhanced
   transport and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carrier. Based
   on electron spin resonance, chemical trapping experiment and density
   functional theory calculation, photoinduced oxidizing species (center
   dot O-2(-) and holes) initially attacked the C-N-C fragment of TC
   molecules, which were finally mineralized to CO2, water and inorganic
   matters. Under the synergistic influence of water constituents
   (including acidity and alkalinity, ion species and dissolved organic
   substances), various water matrices greatly affected the degradation
   rate of TC-HCI, with the highest removal efficiency of 78.9% in natural
   seawater, followed by reservoir water (75.0%), tap water (62.3%),
   deionized water (49.8%), reverse osmosis concentrate (32.7%) and
   pharmaceutical wastewater (18.9%). Interestingly, low amounts of the
   emerging microplastics slightly improved TC-HCl removal, whereas high
   amounts (1.428 x 10(7) P/cm(3)) restricted removal due to light
   absorption and the intrinsic adsorption interaction. Moreover, the
   photocatalysts were able over repeated usage. Notably, the hydrogen
   yields rates of polymeric carbon nitride foam were 352.2, 299.8, 184.9
   and 94.3 mu mol/g/h in natural seawater, pharmaceutical wastewater,

AB The design of integrated circuits (ICs) in the analog spectrum is
   intricate due to the signals' continuous nature. Additionally, it is
   strongly affected by the physical implementation of their devices on the
   circuits' layout, a task that has stubbornly defied all automation
   attempts. In this paper, disruptive research using modern embedding
   techniques and a fully unsupervised attention-based encoder-decoder
   model is conducted to automate the placement task of analog IC layout
   design. The attention-based graph-to-sequence model, AGraph2Seq for
   short, differs from other heterogeneous graph embedding approaches by
   introducing structure in both the input and output data in an
   encoder-decoder architecture. The structure allows for a smaller and
   more effective placement regression model, drastically reducing the
   number of trainable parameters and turning the model inherently
   independent of the circuit topology in terms of the way devices are
   connected and the number of devices in a circuit, turning it easily
   scalable to circuits with higher complexity. Additionally, the attention
   mechanism makes the model's decoder invariant to the input devices'
   order. The deep model is ultimately trained in an end-to-end fashion to
   minimize a fully unsupervised loss function that efficiently evaluates
   the fulfillment of fundamental placement's topological constraints. As a
   proof of concept, the final model, but also its intermediate stages,
   i.e., encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder without attention,
   are extensively used to propose different placement solutions for
   several modern analog IC blocks in multiple deep nanometer technology
   nodes at pushbutton speed, including topologies not present in the
   training set. These present a level of generalization beyond traditional
   analog IC placement methodologies and most recent machine learning-based
   approaches and compete with or outperform highly optimized analog
   layouts and human-made designs.

AB Motivation: Predictive models of DNA chromatin profile (i.e. epigenetic
   state), such as transcription factor binding, are essential for
   understanding regulatory processes and developing gene therapies. It is
   known that the 3D genome, or spatial structure of DNA, is highly
   influential in the chromatin profile. Deep neural networks have achieved
   state of the art performance on chromatin profile prediction by using
   short windows of DNA sequences independently. These methods, however,
   ignore the long-range dependencies when predicting the chromatin
   profiles because modeling the 3D genome is challenging.
   Results: In this work, we introduce ChromeGCN, a graph convolutional
   network for chromatin profile prediction by fusing both local sequence
   and long-range 3D genome information. By incorporating the 3D genome, we
   relax the independent and identically distributed assumption of local
   windows for a better representation of DNA. ChromeGCN explicitly
   incorporates known long-range interactions into the modeling, allowing
   us to identify and interpret those important long-range dependencies in
   influencing chromatin profiles. We show experimentally that by fusing
   sequential and 3D genome data using ChromeGCN, we get a significant
   improvement over the state-of-the-art deep learning methods as indicated
   by three metrics. Importantly, we show that ChromeGCN is particularly
   useful for identifying epigenetic effects in those DNA windows that have
   a high degree of interactions with other DNA windows.

AB Cancer diagnosis, prognosis, mymargin and therapeutic response
   predictions are based on morphological information from histology slides
   and molecular profiles from genomic data. However, most deep
   learning-based objective outcome prediction and grading paradigms are
   based on histology or genomics alone and do not make use of the
   complementary information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we
   propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for end-to-end
   multimodal fusion of histology image and genomic (mutations, CNV,
   RNA-Seq) features for survival outcome prediction. Our approach models
   pairwise feature interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker
   product of unimodal feature representations, and controls the
   expressiveness of each representation via a gating-based attention
   mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to interpret and
   saliently localize features across each modality, and understand how
   feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We
   validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma
   datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired
   whole-slide image, genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth
   survival and histologic grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our
   results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion paradigm
   improves prognostic determinations from ground truth grading and
   molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks trained on
   histology and genomic data alone. The proposed method establishes
   insight and theory on how to train deep networks on multimodal
   biomedical data in an intuitive manner, which will be useful for other
   problems in medicine that seek to combine heterogeneous data streams for
   understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to
   treatment. Code and trained models are made available at:

AB The rapid increase in the number of proteins in sequence databases and
   the diversity of their functions challenge computational approaches for
   automated function prediction. Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph
   Convolutional Network for predicting protein functions by leveraging
   sequence features extracted from a protein language model and protein
   structures. It outperforms current leading methods and sequence-based
   Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the size of current sequence
   repositories. Augmenting the training set of experimental structures
   with homology models allows us to significantly expand the number of
   predictable functions. DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability,
   with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are
   replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function
   predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-specific
   annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the
   utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from
   the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new confident function
   predictions. DeepFRI is available as a webserver at

AB Multispectral points, as a new data source containing both spectrum and
   spatial geometry, opens the door to three-dimensional (3D) land cover
   classification at a finer scale. In this paper, we model the
   multispectral points as a graph and propose a multi-attribute smooth
   graph convolutional network (MaSGCN) for multispectral points
   classification. We construct the spatial graph, spectral graph, and
   geometric-spectral graph respectively to mine patterns in spectral,
   spatial, and geometric-spectral domains. Then, the multispectral points
   graph is generated by combining the spatial, spectral, and
   geometric-spectral graphs. Moreover, dimensionality features and
   spectrums are introduced to screen the appropriate connection points for
   constructing the spatial graph. For remote sensing scene classification
   tasks, it is usually desirable to make the classification map relatively
   smooth and avoid salt and pepper noise. A heat operator is then
   introduced to enhance the low-frequency filters and enforce the
   smoothness in the graph signal. Considering that different land covers
   have different scale characteristics, we use multiple scales instead of
   the single scale when leveraging heat operator on graph convolution. The
   experimental results on two real multispectral points data sets
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MaSGCN to several
   state-of-the-art methods.

AB The revolutionary advances in machine learning and data mining
   techniques have contributed greatly to the rapid developments of
   maritime Internet of Things (IoT). In maritime IoT, the spatio-temporal
   vessel trajectories, collected from the hybrid satellite-terrestrial
   automatic identification system (AIS) base stations, are of considerable
   importance for promoting traffic situation awareness and vessel traffic
   services, etc. To guarantee traffic safety and efficiency, it is
   essential to robustly and accurately predict the AIS-based vessel
   trajectories (i.e., the future positions of vessels) in maritime IoT. In
   this work, we propose a spatio-temporal multigraph convolutional network
   (STMGCN)-based trajectory prediction framework using the mobile edge
   computing (MEC) paradigm. Our STMGCN is mainly composed of three
   different graphs, which are, respectively, reconstructed according to
   the social force, the time to closest point of approach, and the size of
   surrounding vessels. These three graphs are then jointly embedded into
   the prediction framework by introducing the spatio-temporal multigraph
   convolutional layer. To further enhance the prediction performance, the
   self-attention temporal convolutional layer is proposed to further
   optimize STMGCN with fewer parameters. Owing to the high
   interpretability and powerful learning ability, STMGCN is able to
   achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and
   robustness. The reliable prediction results are potentially beneficial
   for traffic safety management and intelligent vehicle navigation in
   MEC-enabled maritime IoT.

AB Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a critical step in the diagnosis of
   upper gastrointestinal disorders. However, due to inexperience or high
   workload, there is a wide variation in EGD performance by endoscopists.
   Variations in performance may result in exams that do not completely
   cover all anatomical locations of the stomach, leading to a potential
   risk of missed diagnosis of gastric diseases. Numerous guidelines or
   expert consensus have been proposed to assess and optimize the quality
   of endoscopy. However, there is a lack of mature and robust methods to
   accurately apply to real clinical real-time video environments. In this
   paper, we innovatively define the problem of recognizing anatomical
   locations in videos as a multi-label recognition task. This can be more
   consistent with the model learning of image-to-label mapping
   relationships. We propose a combined structure of a deep learning model
   (GL-Net) that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) with long
   short-term memory (LSTM) networks to both extract label features and
   correlate temporal dependencies for accurate real-time anatomical
   locations identification in gastroscopy videos. Our methodological
   evaluation dataset is based on complete videos of real clinical
   examinations. A total of 29,269 images from 49 videos were collected as
   a dataset for model training and validation. Another 1736 clinical
   videos were retrospectively analyzed and evaluated for the application
   of the proposed model. Our method achieves 97.1% mean accuracy (mAP),
   95.5% mean per-class accuracy and 93.7% average overall accuracy in a
   multi-label classification task, and is able to process these videos in
   real-time at 29.9 FPS. In addition, based on our approach, we designed a
   system to monitor routine EGD videos in detail and perform statistical
   analysis of the operating habits of endoscopists, which can be a useful
   tool to improve the quality of clinical endoscopy.

AB Background: At present, using computer methods to predict drug-target
   interactions (DTIs) is a very important step in the discovery of new
   drugs and drug relocation processes. The potential DTIs identified by
   machine learning methods can provide guidance in biochemical or clinical
   experiments.
   Objective: The goal of this article is to combine the latest network
   representation learning methods for drug-target prediction research,
   improve model prediction capabilities, and promote new drug development.
   Methods: We use large-scale information network embedding (LINE) method
   to extract network topology features of drugs, targets, diseases, etc.,
   integrate features obtained from heterogeneous networks, construct
   binary classification samples, and use random forest (RF) method to
   predict DTIs.
   Results: The experiments in this paper compare the common classifiers of
   RF, LR, and SVM, as well as the typical network representation learning
   methods of LINE, Node2Vec, and DeepWalk. It can be seen that the
   combined method LINE-RF achieves the best results, reaching an AUC of
   0.9349 and an AUPR of 0.9016.
   Conclusion: The learning method based on LINE network can effectively
   learn drugs, targets, diseases and other hidden features from the
   network topology. The combination of features learned through multiple
   networks can enhance the expression ability. RF is an effective method
   of supervised learning. Therefore, the Line-RF combination method is a
   widely applicable method.

AB The process of designing biomolecules, in particular proteins, is
   witnessing a rapid change in available tooling and approaches, moving
   from design through physicochemical force fields, to producing
   plausible, complex sequences fast via end-to-end differentiable
   statistical models. To achieve conditional and controllable protein
   design, researchers at the interface of artificial intelligence and
   biology leverage advances in natural language processing (NLP) and
   computer vision techniques, coupled with advances in computing hardware
   to learn patterns from growing biological databases, curated annotations
   thereof, or both. Once learned, these patterns can be used to provide
   novel insights into mechanistic biology and the design of biomolecules.
   However, navigating and understanding the practical applications for the
   many recent protein design tools is complex. To facilitate this, we 1)
   document recent advances in deep learning (DL) assisted protein design
   from the last three years, 2) present a practical pipeline that allows
   to go from de novo-generated sequences to their predicted properties and
   web-powered visualization within minutes, and 3) leverage it to suggest
   a generated protein sequence which might be used to engineer a
   biosynthetic gene cluster to produce a molecular glue-like compound.
   Lastly, we discuss challenges and highlight opportunities for the
   protein design field.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate precipitation prediction can help decision makers judge the
   trend of climate change and formulate more effective measures, and
   prevent flood and drought disasters. In this paper, we propose a
   short-term regional precipitation prediction model based on
   wind-improved spatiotemporal convolutional network. Among them, the
   improved graph convolution network integrates the effects of wind
   direction and geographic location at past moments to capture the spatial
   dependence, whilst the gated recurrent unit captures the temporal
   dependence by learning the dynamic changes of data. The spatio-temporal
   memory flow module and attention module are added to capture spatial
   deformation and temporal variation more accurately, thereby better
   matching the physical properties of precipitation. The proposed model
   achieves better prediction results on real data sets. Experiments show
   that our method is better at extracting the spatio-temporal information
   of precipitation data and capturing its time dependence and spatial
   correlation.
   Plain Language Summary Deep-learning technology has not been fully
   explored in regional short-term precipitation prediction. The
   traditional graph convolution neural network does not consider the
   practical significance of wind direction in precipitation. Therefore, we
   introduce a novel short-term regional precipitation prediction model
   based on wind improved spatiotemporal convolution network (ASS-TGCN).
   Measured data of automatic meteorological station in Jiangsu Province,
   China have been utilized. Compared with the comparison model, our
   proposed model has achieved better performance in various indicators.

AB A material of graphitic carbon nitride-supported cobalt oxides
   (Co3O4/g-CN) was synthesized via a facile and cost-effective
   impregnation route as a high-performance catalyst for decomposition of
   N2O. For comparison, bare Co3O4 and other Co3O4 catalysts supported on
   activated carbon (AC) and gamma-Al2O3 (Co3O4-A, Co3O4/AC, and
   Co3O4/gamma-Al2O3, respectively) were also prepared. While g-CN was
   found to be active in the decomposition of N2O, AC and gamma-Al2O3 were
   inert to this reaction. Co3O4/g-CN showed superior catalytic activity
   than the other catalysts, and concurrently exhibited much higher
   specific activity compared to Co3O4-A. The experimental results revealed
   that all examined catalysts had the spinel structure. The Co species
   could incorporate into the gCN matrix/layers and bond to the g-CN matrix
   through Co-N coordination bonds. The excellent performance of
   Co3O4/gamma-CN was attributed to the high surface Co2+ content, massive
   surface oxygen species, facile electrons transfer from the catalyst to
   N2O domains, and the synergistic coupling effects among active species
   such as Co3+/Co2+ redox couple, Co-N, and nitrogen sites. The active
   Co3O4/g-CN catalyst additional activity tests were conducted with N2O
   gas contaminated with H2O, O-2, or NO.

AB 3D hand pose estimation from a monocular RGB image is a highly
   challenging task due to self-occlusion, diverse appearances, and
   inherent depth ambiguities within monocular images. Most of the previous
   methods first employ deep neural networks to fit 2D joint location maps,
   then combines them with implicit or explicit pose-aware features to
   directly regress 3D hand joints positions using their designed network
   structure. However, the skeleton positions and corresponding
   skeleton-aware content information located in the latent space are
   invariably ignored. These skeleton-aware contents effectively bridge the
   gap between hand joint and hand skeleton information by associating the
   relationship between different hand joints features and the hand
   skeleton positions distribution in 2D space. To address this issue, we
   propose a simple yet efficient deep neural network to directly recover
   reliable 3D hand pose from monocular RGB images with faster estimation
   process. Our purpose is the reduction of the model computational
   complexity while maintaining high precision performance. Therefore, we
   design a novel Feature Chat Block (FCB) to complete feature boosting,
   which enables the intuitively enhanced interaction between joint and
   skeleton features. First, this FCB module updates joint features
   effectively based on semantic graph convolutional neural network and
   multi-head self-attention mechanism. The GCN-based structure focuses on
   the physical hand joints included in a binary adjacency matrix and the
   self-attention part pays attention to hand joints located in a
   complementary matrix. Then, the FCB module employs query and key
   mechanisms respectively representing joint and skeleton features to
   further implement feature interaction. After a set of FCB modules, our
   model updates the fused features in a coarse-to-fine manner and finally
   outputs a predicted 3D hand pose. We conducted a comprehensive set of
   ablation experiments on the InterHand2.6M dataset to validate the
   effectiveness and significance of the proposed method. Additionally,
   experimental results on Rendered Hand Dataset, Stereo Hand Datasets,
   First-Person Hand Action Dataset and FreiHAND Dataset show our model
   surpasses the state-of-the-art methods with faster inference speed.

AB Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset muscle disease
   caused by an abnormal (GCN) triplet expansion within the
   polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene and consequent mRNA
   processing impairment and myogenic defects. Because a reduced cell
   proliferation potential and the consequent regeneration failure of aging
   muscle have been shown to be governed by lethal-7 (let-7)
   microRNA-mediated mechanisms, in the present study, we evaluated the
   role of let-7 in the pathogenesis of OPMD. By a multidisciplinary
   approach, including confocal microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative
   PCR analyses on muscle biopsies from patients and unaffected
   individuals, we found a significant increase in let-7 expression in OPMD
   muscles associated with an unusual high percentage of paired box
   7-positive satellite cells. Furthermore, IL-6, a cytokine involved in
   the regulation of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation and a
   potential target of let-7, was found strongly down-regulated in OPMD
   compared with control muscles. The decrease in IL-6 transcript levels
   and protein content was also confirmed in vitro during differentiation
   of patients' and controls' muscle cells. Overall, our data suggest a key
   role of let-7 in the regeneration and degeneration process in OPMD
   muscle and pointed to IL-6 as a potential target molecule for new
   therapeutic approaches for this disorder.-Cappelletti, C., Galbardi, B.,

AB Crime issues have been attracting widespread attention from citizens and
   managers of cities due to their unexpected and massive consequences. As
   an effective technique to prevent and control urban crimes, the
   data-driven spatial-temporal crime prediction can provide reasonable
   estimations associated with the crime hotspot. It thus contributes to
   the decision making of relevant departments under limited resources, as
   well as promotes civilized urban development. However, the deficient
   performance in the aspect of the daily spatial-temporal crime prediction
   at the urban-district-scale needs to be further resolved, which serves
   as a critical role in police resource allocation. In order to establish
   a practical and effective daily crime prediction framework at an urban
   police-district-scale, an "online" integrated graph model is proposed. A
   residual neural network (ResNet), graph convolutional network (GCN), and
   long short-term memory (LSTM) are integrated with an attention mechanism
   in the proposed model to extract and fuse the spatial-temporal features,
   topological graphs, and external features. Then, the "online" integrated
   graph model is validated by daily theft and assault data within 22
   police districts in the city of Chicago, US from 1 January 2015 to 7
   January 2020. Additionally, several widely used baseline models,
   including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ridge
   regression, support vector regression (SVR), random forest, extreme
   gradient boosting (XGBoost), LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN),
   and Conv-LSTM models, are compared with the proposed model from a
   quantitative point of view by using the same dataset. The results show
   that the predicted spatial-temporal patterns by the proposed model are
   close to the observations. Moreover, the integrated graph model performs
   more accurately since it has lower average values of the mean absolute
   error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) than the other eight
   models. Therefore, the proposed model has great potential in supporting
   the decision making for the police in the fields of patrolling and
   investigation, as well as resource allocation.

AB Motivation: Due to cancer heterogeneity, the therapeutic effect may not
   be the same when a cohort of patients of the same cancer type receive
   the same treatment. The anticancer drug response prediction may help
   develop personalized therapy regimens to increase survival and reduce
   patients' expenses. Recently, graph neural network-based methods have
   aroused widespread interest and achieved impressive results on the drug
   response prediction task. However, most of them apply graph convolution
   to process cell line-drug bipartite graphs while ignoring the intrinsic
   differences between cell lines and drug nodes. Moreover, most of these
   methods aggregate node-wise neighbor features but fail to consider the
   element-wise interaction between cell lines and drugs.
   Results: This work proposes a neighborhood interaction (NI)-based
   heterogeneous graph convolution network method, namely NIHGCN, for
   anticancer drug response prediction in an end-to-end way. Firstly, it
   constructs a heterogeneous network consisting of drugs, cell lines and
   the known drug response information. Cell line gene expression and drug
   molecular fingerprints are linearly transformed and input as node
   attributes into an interaction model. The interaction module consists of
   a parallel graph convolution network layer and a NI layer, which
   aggregates node-level features from their neighbors through graph
   convolution operation and considers the element-level of interactions
   with their neighbors in the NI layer. Finally, the drug response
   predictions are made by calculating the linear correlation coefficients
   of feature representations of cell lines and drugs. We have conducted
   extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our model on Cancer
   Drug Sensitivity Data (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
   datasets. It has achieved the best performance compared with the
   state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in predicting drug responses for
   new cell lines, new drugs and targeted drugs. Furthermore, our model
   that was well trained on the GDSC dataset can be successfully applied to
   predict samples of PDX and TCGA, which verified the transferability of
   our model from cell line in vitro to the datasets in vivo.
   Availability and implementation: The source code can be obtained from.

AB Mutant KRAS is a key driver in colorectal cancer (CRC) and promotes Myc
   translation and Myc-dependent stress adaptation and proliferation. Here,
   we report that the combination of two FDA-approved drugs Bortezomib and
   Everolimus (RAD001) (BR) is highly efficacious against mutant KRAS CRC
   cells. Mechanistically, the combination, not single agent, rapidly
   depletes Myc protein, not mRNA, and leads to GCN2- and
   p-eIF2alpha-dependent cell death through the activation of extrinsic and
   intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Cell death is selectively induced in
   mutant KRAS CRC cells with elevated basal Myc and p-eIF2alpha and is
   characterized by CHOP induction and transcriptional signatures in
   proteotoxicity, oxidative stress, metabolic inhibition, and immune
   activation. BR-induced p-GCN2/p-eIF2alpha elevation and cell death are
   strongly attenuated by MYC knockdown and enhanced by MYC overexpression.
   The BR combination is efficacious against mutant KRAS patient derived
   organoids (PDO) and xenografts (PDX) by inducing p-eIF2alpha/CHOP and
   cell death. Interestingly, an elevated four-gene (DDIT3, GADD45B, CRYBA4
   and HSPA1L) stress signature is linked to shortened overall survival in
   CRC patients. These data support that Myc-dependent stress adaptation
   drives the progression of mutant KRAS CRC and serves as a therapeutic
   vulnerability, which can be targeted using dual translational
   inhibitors.

AB Network alignment, or identifying the same entities (anchors) across
   multiple networks, has significant applications across diverse fields.
   Unsupervised approaches for network alignment, though popular, strictly
   assume that the anchor nodes' structure and attributes remain consistent
   across different networks. However, in practice, strictly adhering to
   these constraints makes it difficult to deal with networks with high
   variance in the structural characteristics and inherent structural
   noises like missing nodes and edges, resulting in poor generalization.
   In order to handle these shortcomings, we propose HCNA: Hyperbolic
   Contrastive Learning Framework for Self -Supervised Network Alignment ,
   a novel self-supervised contrastive learning model which learns from the
   multiple augmented views of each network, thereby making HCNA robust to
   the inherent multi-network characteristics. Furthermore, we propose
   multi-order hyperbolic graph convolution networks to generate node
   embedding for each network which can handle the hierarchical structure
   of networks. The main objective of HCNA is to obtain
   structure-preserving embeddings that are also robust to noises and
   variations for better alignment results. The major novelty lies in
   generating augmented multiple graph views for contrastive learning that
   are driven by real world network dynamics. Rigorous investigations on 4
   real datasets show that HCNA consistently outperforms the baselines by
   at least 1-84% in terms of accuracy score. Furthermore, HCNA is also
   more resilient to structural and attributes noises, as evidenced by its
   adaptivity analysis on adversarial conditions.

AB Motivation: Biological pathway is an important curated knowledge of
   biological processes. Thus, cancer subtype classification based on
   pathways will be very useful to understand differences in biological
   mechanisms among cancer subtypes. However, pathways include only a
   fraction of the entire gene set, only one-third of human genes in KEGG,
   and pathways are fragmented. For this reason, there are few
   computational methods to use pathways for cancer subtype classification.
   Results: We present an explainable deep-learning model with attention
   mechanism and network propagation for cancer subtype classification.
   Each pathway is modeled by a graph convolutional network. Then, a
   multi-attention based ensemble model combines several hundreds of
   pathways in an explainable manner. Lastly, network propagation on
   pathway gene network explains why gene expression profiles in subtypes
   are different. In experiments with five TCGA cancer datasets, our method
   achieved very good classification accuracies and, additionally,
   identified subtype-specific pathways and biological functions.

AB In translation initiation, AUG recognition triggers rearrangement of the
   48S preinitiation complex (PIC) from an open conformation to a closed
   state with more tightly-bound Met-tRNAi. Cryo-EM structures have
   revealed interactions unique to the closed complex between arginines
   R55/R57 of eIF2 alpha with mRNA, including the -3 nucleotide of the
   'Kozak' context. We found that R55/R57 substitutions reduced recognition
   of a UUG start codon at HIS4 in Sui(-) cells (Ssu(-) phenotype); and in
   vitro, R55G-R57E accelerated dissociation of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi
   ternary complex (TC) from reconstituted PICs with a UUG start codon,
   indicating destabilization of the closed complex. R55/R57 substitutions
   also decreased usage of poor-context AUGs in SUI1 and GCN4 mRNAs in
   vivo. In contrast, eIF2 alpha-R53 interacts with the rRNA backbone only
   in the open complex, and the R53E substitution enhanced initiation at a
   UUG codon (Sui(-) phenotype) and poor-context AUGs, while reducing the
   rate of TC loading (Gcd(-) phenotype) in vivo. Consistently, R53E slowed
   TC binding to the PIC while decreasing TC dissociation at UUG codons in
   vitro, indicating destabilization of the open complex. Thus, distinct
   interactions of eIF2 alpha with rRNA or mRNA stabilize first the open,
   and then closed, conformation of the PIC to influence the accuracy of
   initiation in vivo.

AB Binary code traceability aims to use the relevant characteristics of
   anonymous binary codes to identify concealed authors or teams and
   replace error-prone and time-consuming manual reverse engineering tasks
   with automated systems. Although significant progress has been made in
   source code traceability technology, research on tracking binary files
   is still limited. Hence, we propose a feature extraction method and deep
   learning model that exploit the sequence and structure information of
   binary codes to identify the authors of anonymous and malicious binary
   codes and their relations with other known binary code families. We
   further propose a new multigranularity information fusion feature based
   on biological genes oriented to the traceability of binary codes. The
   evaluations conducted on the Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset indicate that
   our method can accurately trace the binary code from 10 00 people to the
   target author with an accuracy rate of 71%. Further, experimental
   results verify the robustness of the proposed model. For malicious code
   datasets, in particular, the proposed method achieved a stable
   traceability accuracy rate for malicious samples using only a small
   number of training samples. For the problem of malicious code tracking,
   in 300 team organizations, the proposed method achieved a code-tracing
   accuracy rate of 82%. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hard carbons (HCs) possess high lithium/sodium storage capacities, which
   however suffer from low electric conductivity and poor ion diffusion
   kinetics. An efficient structure design with appropriate heteroatoms
   doping and optimized graphitic/defective degree is highly desired to
   tackle these problems. This work reports a new design of N-doped HC
   nanoshells (N-GCNs) with homogeneous defective nanographite domains,
   fabricated through the prechelation between Ni2+ and chitosan and
   subsequent catalyst confined graphitization. The as-prepared N-GCNs
   deliver a high reversible lithium storage capacity of 1253 mA h g(-1),
   with outstanding rate performance (175 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 20 A
   g(-1)) and good cycling stability, which outperforms most
   state-of-the-art HCs. Meanwhile, a high reversible sodium storage
   capacity of 325 mA h g(-1) is also obtained, which stabilizes at 174 mA
   h g(-1) after 200 cycles. Density functional theory calculations are
   performed to uncover the coupling effect between heteroatom-doping and
   the defective nanographitic domains down to the atomic scale. The in
   situ Raman analysis reveals the adsorption mechanism for sodium storage
   and the adsorption-intercalation mechanism for lithium storage of
   N-GCNs.

AB Code summarization aims to generate high-quality functional summaries of
   code snippets to improve the efficiency of program development and
   maintenance. It is a pressing challenge for code summariza-tion models
   to capture more comprehensive code knowledge by integrating the feature
   correlations between the semantics and syntax of the code. In this
   paper, we propose a multi-modal similarity network based code
   summarization method: GT-SimNet. It proposes a novel code semantic
   modelling method based on a local application programming interface
   (API) dependency graph (Local-ADG), which exhibits an excellent ability
   to mask irrelevant semantics outside the current code snippet. For code
   feature fusion, GT-SimNet uses the SimNet network to calculate the
   correlation coefficients between Local-ADG and abstract syntax tree
   (AST) nodes and performs fusion under the influence of the correlation
   coefficients. Finally, it completes the prediction of the target summary
   by the generator. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
   performance of GT-SimNet on two language datasets (Java and Solidity).
   The results show that GT-SimNet achieved BLEU scores of 38.73% and
   41.36% on the two datasets, 1.47%similar to 2.68% higher than the best
   existing baseline. Importantly, GT-SimNet reduces the BLEU scores by
   7.28% after removing Local-ADG. This indicates that Local-ADG is
   effective for the semantic representation of the code.(c) 2022 Elsevier

AB Either traditional learning methods or deep learning methods have been
   widely applied for the early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but
   these methods often suffer from the issue of training set bias and have
   no interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
   two-phase framework to iteratively assign weights to samples and
   features. Specifically, the first phase automatically distinguishes
   clean samples from training samples. Training samples are regarded as
   noisy data and thus should be assigned different weights for penalty,
   while clean samples are of high quality and thus are used to learn the
   feature weights. In the second phase, our method iteratively assigns
   sample weights to the training samples and feature weights to the clean
   samples. Moreover, their updates are iterative so that the proposed
   framework deals with the training set bias issue as well as contains
   interpretability on both samples and features. Experimental results on
   the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that
   our method achieves the best classification performance in terms of
   binary classification tasks and has better interpretability, compared to
   the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Eukaryotes harbour a conserved signalling pathway, called General Amino
   Acid Control (GAAC) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for overcoming amino
   acid starvation. Upon starvation, the protein kinase Gcn2, which
   phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha,
   becomes stimulated to trigger the GAAC response. Genetic studies suggest
   that Yih1, which is the yeast homolog of mammalian IMPACT and which
   binds monomeric actin, inhibits Gcn2 when released from actin. Here, we
   found that D56A substitution in actin (the act1-9 allele) leads to
   reduced eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, suggesting that the Asp56 residue is
   required for full Gcn2 activation. In the act1-9 mutant, Yih1
   overexpression further enhanced the sensitivity to amino acid
   starvation-inducing drugs and further impaired eIF2 alpha
   phosphorylation, suggesting that Gcn2 inhibition was mediated via Yih1.
   The D56A substitution may impair the actin-Yih1 interaction, directly or
   indirectly, thereby increasing the amount of Yih1 available to inhibit
   Gcn2.

AB Pose estimation is an essential technology for product grasping and
   assembly in intelligent manufacturing. Finding local correspondences
   between the 2-D image and the 3-D model is the key step to estimate the
   6-D pose of an object. However, when the objects are textureless, it is
   difficult to identify distinguishable point features. In this article,
   we propose a novel deep learning framework called the pseudo-Siamese
   graph matching network to tackle the problem of feature matching of
   textureless objects and estimate accurate object poses with a single
   RGB-only image. We utilize a pseudo-Siamese network structure to learn
   the similarity between the 2-D image features and the 3-D mesh model of
   the object. A fully convolutional network and a graph convolutional
   network are used to extract high-dimensional deep features of the 2-D
   image and the 3-D model, respectively. Dense 2-D-3-D correspondences are
   inferred using the pseudo-Siamese matching network. Then, the pose of
   the object is calculated by the Perspective-n-Point and random sample
   consensus (RANSAC) methods. Experiments on the LINEMOD dataset and a
   grasping task for metal part show the accuracy and robustness of our
   proposed method.(1)

AB Bot detection is a fundamental and crucial task for tracing and
   mitigating cyber threats in the Internet. This paper aims to address two
   major limitations of current bot detection systems. First, existing
   flow-based bot detection approaches ignore structural information of
   botnets, which lead to false detection. Second, they cannot identify the
   interactive behavioral patterns among heterogeneous botnet objects. In
   this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework, namely
   Bot-AHGCN, which models fine-grained network flow objects (e.g., IP,
   response) as a multi-attributed heterogeneous graph and transforms bot
   detection problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the
   graph. Particularly, we first build a multi-attributed heterogeneous
   information network (AHIN) to model the interdependent relationships
   among botnet objects. Second, we present a weight-learning based node
   embedding method, which learns the interactive behavioral patterns among
   hots and integrates them into weighted similarity graphs. Finally, we
   perform graph convolution on the learned similarity graphs to
   characterize more comprehensive and discriminative features of hots, and
   feed them into a forward neural network to identify hots. The overall
   experimental results on two real-world datasets confirm that Bot-AHGCN
   outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches, and presents
   better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-paths and
   meta-graphs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lung cancer is one of the deadliest, most aggressive cancers. Abrupt
   changes in gene expression represent an important challenge to
   understand and fight the disease. Gene co-expression networks (GCNs)
   have been widely used to study the genomic regulatory landscape of human
   cancer. Here, based on 1,143 RNA-Seq experiments from the TCGA
   collaboration, we constructed GCN for the most common types of lung
   tumors: adenocarcinoma (TAD) and squamous cells (TSCs) as well as their
   respective control networks (NAD and NSC). We compared the number of
   intra-chromosome (cis-) and inter-chromosome (trans-) co-expression
   interactions in normal and cancer GCNs. We compared the number of shared
   interactions between TAD and TSC, as well as in NAD and NSC, to observe
   which phenotypes were more alike. By means of an over-representation
   analysis, we associated network topology features with biological
   functions. We found that TAD and TSC present mostly cis- small
   disconnected components, whereas in control GCNs, both types have a
   giant trans- component. In both cancer networks, we observed cis-
   components in which genes not only belong to the same chromosome but to
   the same cytoband or to neighboring cytobands. This supports the
   hypothesis that in lung cancer, gene co-expression is constrained to
   small neighboring regions. Despite this loss of distant co-expression
   observed in TAD and TSC, there are some remaining trans- clusters. These
   clusters seem to play relevant roles in the carcinogenic processes. For
   instance, some clusters in TAD and TSC are associated with the immune
   system, response to virus, or control of gene expression. Additionally,
   other non-enriched trans- clusters are composed of one gene and several
   associated pseudo-genes, as in the case of the FTH1 gene. The appearance
   of those common trans- clusters reflects that the gene co-expression
   program in lung cancer conserves some aspects for cell maintenance.
   Unexpectedly, 0.48% of the edges are shared between control networks;
   conversely, 35% is shared between lung cancer GCNs, a 73-fold larger
   intersection. This suggests that in lung cancer a process of
   de-differentiation may be occurring. To further investigate the
   implications of the loss of distant co-expression, it will become
   necessary to broaden the investigation with other omic-based approaches.
   However, the present approach provides a basis for future work toward an
   integrative perspective of abnormal transcriptional regulatory programs
   in lung cancer.

AB In this study, Mittal et al. report that sequence-specific transcription
   factors and their tethered cofactors (e.g., SAGA, Mediator, TUP, NuA4,
   SWI/SNF, and RPD3-L) are generally bound to promoters prior to induction
   ("poised"), rather than recruited upon induction, whereas induction
   recruits the preinitiation complex (PIC) to DNA. Their findings suggest
   that inducible systems, where present, evolved on top of constitutive
   systems.
   Genome-wide, little is understood about how proteins organize at
   inducible promoters before and after induction and to what extent
   inducible and constitutive architectures depend on cofactors. We report
   that sequence-specific transcription factors and their tethered
   cofactors (e.g., SAGA [Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase], Mediator, TUP,
   NuA4, SWI/SNF, and RPD3-L) are generally bound to promoters prior to
   induction ("poised"), rather than recruited upon induction, whereas
   induction recruits the preinitiation complex (PIC) to DNA. Through
   depletion and/or deletion experiments, we show that SAGA does not
   function at constitutive promoters, although a SAGA-independent Gcn5
   acetylates +1 nucleosomes there. When inducible promoters are poised,
   SAGA catalyzes +1 nucleosome acetylation but not PIC assembly. When
   induced, SAGA catalyzes acetylation, deubiquitylation, and PIC assembly.
   Surprisingly, SAGA mediates induction by creating a PIC that allows
   TFIID (transcription factor II-D) to stably associate, rather than
   creating a completely TFIID-independent PIC, as generally thought. These
   findings suggest that inducible systems, where present, are integrated
   with constitutive systems.

AB Interpretation of guided wave signals is a central challenge for
   ultrasonic guided wave-based damage detection and localization
   technology. Because of the complexity of the guided waves that are
   scattered from structural damage, existing guided wave-based damage
   detection methods cannot be used to extract the relationship information
   hidden in the guided waves for use in damage detection and localization.
   A graph-in-graph convolutional network is thus proposed for guided
   wave-based damage detection and localization that constructs spatial &
   x2013;temporal feature representations of the guided wave signals and
   interconnects them into a global graph to indicate the inherent
   differences among these signals. By converting the guided wave
   characteristics into structural and topological information in
   non-Euclidean space, the proposed method correlates the global graph
   with the damage location directly and achieves greater damage detection
   accuracy with fewer training data. Validations are performed using two
   different experimental datasets, which were collected from aluminum
   plates and a composite laminate. The results indicate that the proposed
   method achieves superior performance with high accuracy and stability
   for even limited and imbalanced datasets acquired with only three
   transducers.

AB Purpose: Adenocarcinoma is the most common histopathological type of
   lung cancer, and histopathological images are important for assessing
   the stage and subtype of tumors. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma may
   have genetic alterations in oncogenic drivers, including EGFR, ALK,
   ROS1, BRAF, among others. Among them, the EGFR mutation-positivity in
   Asians is as high as 40%-60%. However, no research has explored the
   relationship between the morphological information of pathological cells
   and the oncogenic driver gene EGFR.Methods: In this paper, we propose a
   novel automatic analysis framework and joint semantic, spatial, and
   clinical information for exploring the relationship between tumor
   microenvironment features and EGFR gene mutations, namely, JSSC-Net. Our
   approach consists of the following modules: the semantic feature
   encoding module, spatial feature encoding module, clinical information
   feature encoding module, and feature fusion module.Results: We collected
   248 digital WSIs images acquired from 248 patients with lung
   adenocarcinoma, and verified the effectiveness of our proposed model on
   this dataset. Our proposed method achieved the accuracy of predicting
   EGFR mutation state was 0.7778, performing significantly better than the
   baseline methods. In addition, we attempted to learn the associations
   between histopathological images and the types of EGFR gene mutation,
   achieving an accuracy was 0.6428.Conclusions: In this study, we proposed
   a novel deep learning-based method to predict the mutation state of EGFR
   gene in lung adenocarcinoma. The experiments proved that the
   conformation of tumor pathology is associated with EGFR
   mutation-positivity, that is, the tumor microenvironment of different
   types is predictive of genetic alterations in oncogenic
   drivers.Significance: We have demonstrated that the proposed deep
   learning-based analysis framework can auto-matically and efficiently
   predict the relationship between tumor microenvironment features and
   EGFR gene mutations. This information is critical for applying
   appropriate and targeted therapies to lung cancer patients, thereby
   increasing the scope and performance of precision medicine.

AB Interactive fusion methods have been successfully applied to multimodal
   sentiment analysis, due to their ability to achieve data complementarity
   via interaction of different modalities. However, previous methods treat
   the information of each modality as a whole and usually treat them
   equally, failing to distinguish the contribution of different semantic
   regions in non-textual features towards textual features. It caused that
   the public regions fail to be captured and private regions are hard to
   be predicted only with textual. Meanwhile, these methods use
   sentiment-independent encoder to encode textual features, which may
   mistakenly identify syntactically irrelevant contextual words as clues
   for predicting sentiment. In this paper, we propose a coordinated-joint
   translation fusion framework with sentiment-interactive graph to solve
   these problems. Specifically, we generate a novel sentiment-interactive
   graph to incorporate sentiment associations between different words into
   the syntactic adjacency matrix. The relationships between nodes are no
   longer limited to the sole existence of syntactic associations but fully
   consider the interaction of sentiment between different words. Then, we
   design a coordinated-joint translation fusion module. This module
   utilizes a cross-modal masked attention mechanism to determine whether
   there is a correlation between the text and non-text inputs, thereby
   identifying the most relevant public semantic features in the visual and
   acoustic modalities corresponding to the text modality. Subsequently, a
   cross-modal translation-aware mechanism is used to calculate the
   differences between the visual and acoustic modalities features
   transformed into the text modality and the text modality itself, which
   allows us to reconstruct the visual and acoustic modalities towards text
   modality to obtain private semantic features. In addition, we construct
   a multimodal fusion layer to fuse textual features and non-textual
   public and private features to improve multimodal interaction effects.
   Experimental results on publicly available datasets CMU-MOSI and
   CMU-MOSEI illustrate that our proposed model achieve a best accuracy of
   86.5% and 86.1%, and best F1 of 86.4% and 86.1%. A series of further
   analyses also indicate the proposed framework effectively improve the
   sentiment identification capability.

AB Users from different cultures and backgrounds often feel comfortable
   expressing their thoughts on trending topics by generating content in
   their regional languages. Recently, there has been an explosion in
   multilingual information, and a massive amount of multilingual textual
   data is added daily on the Internet. Using hashtags for multilingual
   low-resource content can be an effective way to overcome language
   barriers because it allows content to be discovered by a wider audience
   and makes it easier for people interested in the topic to find relevant
   content, regardless of the language in which it was written. To account
   for linguistic diversity and universal access to information, hashtag
   recommendation for multilingual low-resource content is essential.
   Several approaches have been put forth to recommend content-based and
   personalized hashtags for multimodal content in high-resource languages.
   Data availability and linguistic differences often limit the development
   of hashtag recommendation methods for low-resource Indic languages.
   Hashtag recommendation for tweets disseminated in low-resource Indic
   languages has seldom been addressed. Moreover, personalization and
   language usage aspects to recommend hashtags for tweets posted in
   low-resource Indic languages have yet to be explored. In view of the
   foregoing, we propose an automated hashtag recommendation system for
   tweets posted in low-resource Indic languages dubbed as TAGALOG, capable
   of recommending personalized and language-specific hashtags. We employ
   user-guided and language-guided attention mechanisms to distill
   indicative features from low-resource tweets according to the user's
   topical and linguistic preferences. We propose a graph-based neural
   network to mine users' posting behavior by connecting historical tweets
   of a particular user and language relatedness by linking tweets
   according to language families, i.e., Indo-Aryan and Dravidian.
   Experimental results on the curated dataset from Twitter demonstrate
   that the proposed model outperformed recognized pre-trained language
   models and extant research, showing an average improvement of 12.3% and
   12.8% in the F1-score, respectively. TAGALOG recommends hashtags that
   align with the user's interests and linguistic predilections, leading to
   a heightened level of tailored and engaging user experience.
   Personalized and multilingual hashtag recommendation systems for
   low-resource Indic languages can help to improve the discoverability and
   relevance of content in these languages.

AB Background Recent efforts in the field of nutritional science have
   allowed the discovery of disease-beating molecules within foods based on
   the commonality of bioactive food molecules to FDA-approved drugs. The
   pioneering work in this field used an unsupervised network propagation
   algorithm to learn the systemic-wide effect on the human interactome of
   1962 FDA-approved drugs and a supervised algorithm to predict anticancer
   therapeutics using the learned representations. Then, a set of bioactive
   molecules within foods was fed into the model, which predicted molecules
   with cancer-beating potential.The employed methodology consisted of
   disjoint unsupervised feature generation and classification tasks, which
   can result in sub-optimal learned drug representations with respect to
   the classification task. Additionally, due to the disjoint nature of the
   tasks, the employed approach proved cumbersome to optimize, requiring
   testing of thousands of hyperparameter combinations and significant
   computational resources.To overcome the technical limitations
   highlighted above, we represent each drug as a graph (human interactome)
   with its targets as binary node features on the graph and formulate the
   problem as a graph classification task. To solve this task, inspired by
   the success of graph neural networks in graph classification problems,
   we use an end-to-end graph neural network model operating directly on
   the graphs, which learns drug representations to optimize model
   performance in the prediction of anticancer therapeutics. Results The
   proposed model outperforms the baseline approach in the anticancer
   therapeutic prediction task, achieving an F1 score of 67.99%+/- 2.52%
   and an AUPR of 73.91%+/- 3.49%. It is also shown that the model is able
   to capture knowledge of biological pathways to predict anticancer
   molecules based on the molecules' effects on cancer-related pathways.
   Conclusions We introduce an end-to-end graph convolutional model to
   predict cancer-beating molecules within food. The introduced model
   outperforms the existing baseline approach, and shows interpretability,
   paving the way to the future of a personalized nutritional science
   approach allowing the development of nutrition strategies for cancer
   prevention and/or therapeutics.

AB Some filamentous fungi of the Trichoderma genus are used as biocontrol
   agents against airborne and soilborne phytopathogens. The proposed
   mechanism by which Trichoderma spp. antagonizes phytopathogens is
   through the release of lytic enzymes, antimicrobial compounds,
   mycoparasitism, and the induction of systemic disease-resistance in
   plants. Here we analyzed the role of TGF-1 (Trichoderma Gen Five-1), a
   histone acetyltransferase of Trichoderma atroviride, in mycoparasitism
   and antibiosis against the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani.
   Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes
   histone acetylation, slightly affected T. atroviride and R. solani
   growth, but not the growth of the mycoparasite over R. solani.
   Application of TSA to the liquid medium induced synthesis of
   antimicrobial compounds. Expression analysis of the
   mycoparasitism-related genes ech-42 and prb-1, which encode an
   endochitinase and a proteinase, as well as the secondary
   metabolism-related genes pbs-1 and tps-1, which encode a peptaibol
   synthetase and a terpene synthase, respectively, showed that they were
   regulated by TSA. A T. atroviride strain harboring a deletion of tgf-1
   gene showed slow growth, thinner and less branched hyphae than the
   wild-type strain, whereas its ability to coil around the R. solani
   hyphae was not affected. Delta tgf-1 presented a diminished capacity to
   grow over R. solani, but the ability of its mycelium -free culture
   filtrates (MFCF) to inhibit the phytopathogen growth was enhanced.
   Intriguingly, addition of TSA to the culture medium reverted the
   enhanced inhibition growth of Delta tgf-1 MFCF on R. solani at levels
   compared to the wild-type MFCF grown in medium amended with TSA. The
   presence of R. solani mycelium in the culture medium induced similar
   proteinase activity in a Delta tgf-1 compared to the wild-type, whereas
   the chitinolytic activity was higher in a Delta tgf-1 mutant in the
   absence of R. solani, compared to the parental strain. Expression of
   mycoparasitism- and secondary metabolism-related genes in Delta tgf-1
   was differentially regulated in the presence or absence of R. solani.
   These results indicate that histone acetylation may play important roles
   in the biocontrol mechanisms of T. atroviride.

AB General control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is a serine/threonine protein
   kinase, detecting a variety of stresses including amino acid starvation,
   reactive oxygen species, etc. in eukaryotic cells. Activation of GCN2
   requires the interaction of the N-terminal RWD domain with the upstream
   GCN1 protein and the dimerization by the kinase domain. In this study,
   we determined two crystal structures of the RWD domain of human GCN2 in
   two different crystal packing modes. These two different crystal
   structures reveal a same dimer of the RWD domain, which has not been
   reported in previous studies. We further confirmed this novel dimer
   interaction in solution using gel filtration experiments, and in human
   embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using bimolecular fluorescence
   complementation (BiFC) and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays.
   Together, this study discovers a potential protein-protein interface on
   the RWD domain of human GCN2, and suggests a possible regulation between
   the interaction of GCN1 and the formation of GCN2 dimer.

AB The SAGA-like complex SLIK is a modified version of the
   Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex. SLIK is formed through
   C-terminal truncation of the Spt7 SAGAsubunit, causing loss of Spt8, one
   of the subunits that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP). SLIK
   and SAGA are both coactivators of RNA polymerase II transcription in
   yeast, and both SAGA and SLIK perform chromatin modifications. The two
   complexes have been speculated to uniquely contribute to transcriptional
   regulation, but their respective contributions are not clear. To
   investigate, we assayed the chromatinmodifying functions of SAGA and
   SLIK, revealing identical kinetics on minimal substrates in vitro. We
   also examined the binding of SAGA and SLIK to TBP and concluded that
   interestingly, both protein complexes have similar affinity for TBP.
   Additionally, despite the loss of Spt8 and C-terminus of Spt7 in SLIK,
   TBPprebound to SLIKis not released in the presence of TATA-box DNA, just
   like TBP prebound to SAGA. Furthermore, we determined a low-resolution
   cryo-EM structure of SLIK, revealing a modular architecture identical to
   SAGA. Finally, we performed a comprehensive study of DNA-binding
   properties of both coactivators. Purified SAGA and SLIK both associate
   with ssDNA and dsDNA with high affinity (K-D = 10-17 nM), and the
   binding is sequence-independent. In conclusion, our study shows that the
   cleavage of Spt7 and the absence of the Spt8 subunit in SLIK neither
   drive any major conformational differences in its structure comparedwith
   SAGA, nor significantly affect HAT, DUB, or DNA-binding activities in
   vitro.

AB The dark matter content of the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC 1052-DF2, as
   inferred from globular cluster (GC) and stellar kinematics, carries a
   considerable amount of uncertainty, with current constraints also
   allowing for the complete absence of dark matter. We test the viability
   of such a scenario by examining whether in a "baryon-only" mass model
   the observed GC population experiences rapid orbital decay due to
   dynamical friction. Using a suite of 50 multi-GC N-body simulations that
   match observational constraints on both the stellar component of NGC
   1052-DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial line-of-sight
   positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs, we show that there
   is a substantial amount of realization-to-realization variance in the
   evolution of the GCs. Nevertheless, over similar to 10 Gyr, some of the
   GCs experience significant orbital evolution. Others evolve less. A
   combination of reduced dynamical friction in the galaxy core and GC-GC
   scattering keeps the GCs afloat, preventing them from sinking all the
   way to the galaxy center. While the current phase-space coordinates of
   the GCs are not unlikely for a baryon-only mass model, the GC system
   does evolve over time. Therefore, if NGC 1052-DF2 has no dark matter,
   some of its GCs must have formed farther out, and the GC system must
   have been somewhat more extended in the past. The presence of a low-mass
   cuspy halo, while allowed by the kinematics, seems improbable, as
   significantly shorter inspiral timescales in the central region would
   quickly lead to the formation of a nuclear star cluster.

AB Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) has emerged as a promising
   metal-free photocatalyst; however, the polymerization process is still
   poorly understood, and the synthesized g-CN shows a structural
   complexity, with photocatalytic activities far from being optimized.
   Herein we present new insight into its polymerization reaction kinetics
   and develop a quasi-sealed condensation route to properly regulate the
   distribution of the degree of polymerization (DP) in the synthesized
   g-CN. The correlation throughout the condensation process, the
   structure-property relationship, and the photocatalytic performance of
   g-CN have been discussed in detail. The synthesized g-CN shows a
   narrower and uniform DP distribution, possesses improved crystallinity,
   and features a nanoporous texture with fruitful amine groups and better
   water dispersibility, which promotes the fast charge-carrier transport
   under aqueous conditions and give rise to substantially enhanced
   photocatalytic activity. Compared with the conventional counterpart, its
   visible-light activity is 4.88 times higher for hydrogen production,
   7.81 times higher for the degradation of rhodamine B, and 2.47 times
   higher for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. We further report that its
   solar-driven photocatalytic activity is superior to that of the
   representative Degussa TiO2 P25 catalyst for scale-up RhB degradation,
   thus highlighting the great prospects of g-CN-based photocatalysts
   toward practical applications.

AB Instance segmentation in biological images is an important task in the
   field of biological images and biomedical analysis. Different from the
   instance segmentation of natural image scenes, this task is still
   challenging because there are a large number of overlapping objects with
   similar appearance as well as great variability in shape, size and
   texture in the foreground and background. In this paper, we propose a
   novel method for segmentation of graph-guided instances of biological
   images, which successfully addresses these peculiarities. Our method
   predicts the embedding at each pixel and uses clustering to recover
   instances during testing. Specifically, we design the Graph-guided
   Feature Fusion Module in response to overlapping instances. Our
   Graph-guided Feature Fusion Module combines fine deep features and
   coarse shallow features to learn the affinity matrix, and then uses
   graph convolutional network to guide the network to learn object-level
   local features. Next, we devise the Gated Spatial Attention Module to
   effectively learn key spatial information by introducing a gating
   mechanism. Furthermore, we give the Cluster Distance Loss that can
   effectively distinguish foreground objects from similar backgrounds. The
   effectiveness of our proposed method has been verified on various
   biological and biomedical datasets. The experimental results show that
   our method is superior to previous embedding-based instance segmentation
   methods. The SBD metric for our method reached 90.8% on the plant
   phenotype dataset (CVPPP), 72.5% on the cell nucleus dataset (DSB2018),
   and 81.8% on the C.elegans dataset, all achieving state-of-the-art
   performance.

AB The importance of considering related stocks data for the prediction of
   stock price movement has been shown in many studies; however, advanced
   graphical techniques for modeling, embedding and analyzing the behavior
   of inter-related stocks have not been widely exploited for the
   prediction of stocks price movements yet. The main challenges in this
   domain are to find a way for modeling the existing relations among an
   arbitrary set of stocks and to exploit such a model for improving the
   prediction performance for those stocks. The most of existing methods in
   this domain rely on basic graph-analysis techniques, with limited
   prediction power, and suffer from a lack of generality and flexibility.
   In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called GCNET that models
   the relations among an arbitrary set of stocks as a graph structure
   called influence network and uses a set of history-based prediction
   models to infer plausible initial labels for a subset of the stock nodes
   in the graph. Finally, GCNET uses the Graph Convolutional Network
   algorithm to analyze this partially labeled graph and predicts the next
   price direction of movement for each stock in the graph.GCNET is a
   general prediction framework that can be applied for the prediction of
   the price fluctuations of interacting stocks based on their historical
   data. Our experiments and evaluations on a set of stocks from the NASDAQ
   index demonstrate that GCNET improves the performance of the
   state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of Accuracy and Matthew's
   Correlation Coefficient by at least 1.5% and 2%, respectively.

AB The improvement of catalytic efficiency of catalyst is a challenging
   topic especially for solid catalyst that has restrained surface to
   contact reactants. Herein, we reported an effective way to improve the
   catalytic efficiency by designing composites catalyst (to induce
   synergistic effect) and performing the reaction under united
   technologies (to make cooperative contribution). As a model case,
   La-Fe-O mixture (abbreviated as LFO) and graphitic carbon nitride
   (abbreviated as g-CN) composites (LFO@CN-n, where n means the molar
   ratio of the precursors of LFO to g-CN) were synthesized and used as
   photo-Fenton catalysts for oxidation removal of dyes in wastewater.
   Results showed that LFO@CN-16, with g-CN loading of 69%, has the
   properties of both LFO and gCN, and exhibits high efficiency for dyes
   oxidation in the presence of H2O2 and light irradiation, with 98%
   rhodamine B conversion within 25 min, for example. Mechanistic studies
   suggested that center dot OH radicals produced from H2O2 are the
   reaction intermediates, which participate both in the Fenton- and the
   photo-catalytic processes. Moreover, the catalyst can be reused for at
   least 5 cycles with no appreciable loss of activity, and can be applied
   to various organic dyes containing benzene-like cyclic structures with
   high efficiency.

AB As a crucial part of the Intelligent Transportation System, traffic
   forecasting is of great help for traffic management and guidance.
   However, predicting short-term traffic conditions on a large-scale road
   network is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies
   found in traffic data. Previous studies used Euclidean proximity or
   topological adjacency to explore the spatial correlation of traffic
   flows, but did not consider the higher-order connectivity patterns
   exhibited in a road network, which have a significant influence on
   traffic propagation. Meanwhile, traffic sequences display distinct
   multiple time-frequency properties, yet few researchers have made full
   use of this resource. To fill this gap, we propose a novel hybrid
   framework - Wavelet-based Higher-order Spatial-Temporal method
   (Wavelet-HST) to accurately predict network-scale traffic speeds.
   Wavelet-HST first uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose raw
   traffic data into several components with different frequency sub-bands.
   Then a motif-based graph convolutional recurrent neural network
   (Motif-GCRNN) is proposed to learn the higher-order spatio-temporal
   dependencies of traffic speeds from low-frequency components, and
   auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models are employed to simulate
   random fluctuations from the high-frequency components. We evaluate the
   framework on a traffic dataset collected in Chengdu, China, and
   experimental results demonstrate that Wavelet-HST outperforms six
   state-of-art prediction methods by an improvement of 7.8% -10.5% in the
   root mean square error.

AB Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a process of abnormal remodeling of
   cardiomyocytes in response to pressure overload or other stress stimuli,
   resulting in myocardial injury, which is a major risk factor for heart
   failure, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. General control
   nonrepressed protein 5 (GCN5)/lysine acetyltransferase 2 A, a member of
   the histone acetyltransferase and lysine acetyltransferase families,
   regulates a variety of physiological and pathological events. However,
   the function of GCN5 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy remains
   unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of GCN5 in the development
   of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. GCN5 expression was increased in
   isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and mouse hearts of a
   hypertrophic mouse model. GCN5 overexpression aggravated the cardiac
   hypertrophy triggered by transverse aortic constriction surgery. In
   contrast, inhibition of GCN5 impairs the development of pathological
   cardiac hypertrophy. Similar results were obtained upon stimulation of
   NRCMs (having GCN5 overexpressed or knocked down) with phenylephrine.
   Mechanistically, our results indicate that GCN5 exacerbates cardiac
   hypertrophy via excessive activation of the transforming growth factor
   beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38
   signaling pathway. Using a TAK1-specific inhibitor in rescue experiments
   confirmed that the activation of TAK1 is essential for GCN5-mediated
   cardiac hypertrophy. In summary, the current study elucidated the role
   of GCN5 in promotion of cardiac hypertrophy, thereby implying it to be a
   potential target for treatment.

AB We construct the Hilbert space costratification of G = SU(2)-quantum
   gauge theory on a finite spatial lattice in the Hamiltonian approach. We
   build on previous work [F. Furstenberg, G. Rudolph, and M. Schmidt, J.
   Geom. Phys. 119, 66-81 (2017)], where we have implemented the classical
   gauge orbit strata on the quantum level within a suitable holomorphic
   picture. In this picture, each element tau of the classical
   stratification corresponds to the zero locus of a finite subset {p(i)}
   of the algebra R of G-invariant representative functions on G(C)(N).
   Viewing the invariants as multiplication operators (p) over cap (i) on
   the Hilbert space H, the union of their images defines a subspace of H
   whose orthogonal complement H-tau is the element of the costratification
   corresponding to tau. To construct H-tau, one has to determine the
   images of the (p) over cap (i) explicitly. To accomplish this goal, we
   construct an orthonormal basis in H and determine the multiplication law
   for the basis elements; that is, we determine the structure constants of
   R in this basis. This part of our analysis applies to any compact Lie
   group G. For G = SU(2), the above procedure boils down to a problem in
   combinatorics of angular momentum theory. Using this theory, we obtain
   the union of the images of the operators (p) over cap (i) as a subspace
   generated by vectors whose coefficients with respect to our basis are
   given in terms of Wigner's 3nj symbols. The latter are further expressed
   in terms of 9j symbols. Using these techniques, we are also able to
   reduce the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian of this theory to a
   problem in linear algebra. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Following spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple signaling cascades are
   activated instantaneously in the injured segments of the spinal cord to
   create a complex and pathogenic microenvironment, making it difficult to
   treat SCI. Nevertheless, the significance of the integrated stress
   response (ISR) to the series of physiological and pathological changes
   that occur after SCI remains unclear. Through western blotting (WB), we
   determined that the autophosphorylation of stress receptors (GCN2, PERK,
   PKR, and HRI) was enhanced after SCI, leading to increased
   phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha at Ser51. Strikingly, we found that eIF2
   alpha was highly phosphorylated at 1 day post injury (dpi) and that this
   hypophosphorylation was maintained thereafter in the spinal cord,
   especially in neurons, which suggests that intervening with eIF2 alpha
   phosphorylation may be a treatment strategy for SCI. Therefore, we
   employed the small molecule ISRIB, which inhibits eIF2 alpha
   phosphorylation when the ISR is activated at moderate or low levels but
   not when the ISR is highly activated. Daily intraperitoneal injection of
   ISRIB significantly inhibited ISR signaling after SCI, reduced the
   cytosolic localization of RNA-binding proteins, and decreased neuronal
   apoptosis. Histological and functional experiments further demonstrated
   that treatment with ISRIB after SCI effectively curbed morphological
   deterioration and promoted the recovery of locomotor function. In
   summary, the ISR plays an important role in SCI, and ISRIB is a
   promising drug for the treatment of SCI.

AB Objectives: A deep learning-based early warning system is proposed to
   predict sepsis prior to its onset. Design: A novel algorithm was devised
   to detect sepsis 6 hours prior to its onset based on electronic medical
   records. Setting: Retrospective cohorts from three separate hospitals
   are used in this study. Sepsis onset was defined based on Sepsis-3.
   Algorithms are evaluated based on the score function used in the
   Physionet Challenge 2019.Patients: Over 60,000 ICU patients with 40
   clinical variables (vital signs, laboratory results) for each hour of a
   patient's ICU stay were used. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main
   Results: The proposed algorithm predicted the onset of sepsis in the
   precedingnhours (wheren= 4, 6, 8, or 12). Furthermore, the proposed
   method compared how many sepsis patients can be predicted in a short
   time with other methods. To interpret a given result in a clinical
   perspective, the relationship between input variables and the
   probability of the proposed method were presented. The proposed method
   achieved superior results (area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve, and score)
   and predicted more sepsis patients in advance. In official phase, the
   proposed method showed the utility score of -0.101, area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve 0.782, area under the
   precision-recall curve 0.041, accuracy 0.786, and F-measure 0.046.
   Conclusions: Using Physionet Challenge 2019, the proposed method can
   accurately and early predict the onset of sepsis. The proposed method
   can be a practical early warning system in the environment of real
   hospitals.

AB Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (A beta) is an early
   event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is an
   important pathway for maintaining cellular proteostasis and for the
   removal of damaged organelles and protein aggregates in all eukaryotes.
   Despite mounting evidence showing that modulating autophagy promotes
   clearance of A beta aggregates, the regulatory mechanisms and signalling
   pathways underlying this process remain poorly understood. In order to
   gain better insight we used our previously characterised yeast model
   expressing GFP-A beta 42 to identify genes that regulate the removal of
   A beta 42 aggregates by autophagy. We report that GFP-A beta 42 is
   sequestered and is selectively transported to vacuole for degradation
   and that autophagy is the prominent pathway for clearance of aggregates.
   Next, to identify genes that selectively promote the removal of A beta
   42 aggregates, we screened levels of GFP-A beta 42 and non-aggregating
   GFP-A beta 42 (19:34) proteins in a panel of 192 autophagy mutants
   lacking genes involved in regulation and initiation of the pathway,
   cargo selection and degradation processes. The nutrient and stress
   signalling genes RRD1, SNF4, GCN4 and SSE1 were identified. Deletion of
   these genes impaired GFP-A beta 42 clearance and their overexpression
   reduced GFP-A beta 42 levels in yeast. Overall, our findings identify a
   novel role for these nutrient and stress signalling genes in the
   targeted elimination of A beta 42 aggregates, which offer a promising
   avenue for developing autophagy based therapies to suppress amyloid
   deposition in AD.

AB The development of whole slide imaging techniques and online digital
   pathology platforms have accelerated the popularization of telepathology
   for remote tumor diagnoses. During a diagnosis, the behavior information
   of the pathologist can be recorded by the platform and then archived
   with the digital case. The browsing path of the pathologist on the WSI
   is one of the valuable information in the digital database because the
   image content within the path is expected to be highly correlated with
   the diagnosis report of the pathologist. In this article, we proposed a
   novel approach for computer-assisted cancer diagnosis named
   session-based histopathology image recommendation (SHIR) based on the
   browsing paths on WSIs. To achieve the SHIR, we developed a novel
   diagnostic regions attention network (DRA-Net) to learn the pathology
   knowledge from the image content associated with the browsing paths. The
   DRA-Net does not rely on the pixel-level or region-level annotations of
   pathologists. All the data for training can be automatically collected
   by the digital pathology platform without interrupting the pathologists'
   diagnoses. The proposed approaches were evaluated on a gastric dataset
   containing 983 cases within 5 categories of gastric lesions. The
   quantitative and qualitative assessments on the dataset have
   demonstrated the proposed SHIR framework with the novel DRA-Net is
   effective in recommending diagnostically relevant cases for auxiliary
   diagnosis. The MRR and MAP for the recommendation are respectively 0.816
   and 0.836 on the gastric dataset. The source code of the DRA-Net is
   available at https://github.com/zhengyushan/dpathnet.

PD 2022

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment
   expressed in a review with respect to a given aspect. The core of ABSA
   is to model the interaction between the context and given aspect to
   extract aspect-related information. In prior work, attention mechanisms
   and dependency graph networks are commonly adopted to capture the
   relations between the context and given aspect. And the weighted sum of
   context hidden states is used as the final representation fed to the
   classifier. However, the information related to the given aspect may be
   already discarded and adverse information may be retained in the context
   modeling processes of existing models. Such a problem cannot be solved
   by subsequent modules due to two reasons. First, their operations are
   conducted on the encoder-generated context hidden states, whose value
   cannot be changed after the encoder. Second, existing encoders only
   consider the context while not the given aspect. To address this
   problem, we argue the given aspect should be considered as a new clue
   out of context in the context modeling process. As for solutions, we
   design three streams of aspect-aware context encoders: an aspect-aware
   LSTM, an aspect-aware GCN, and three aspect-aware BERTs. They are
   dedicated to generating aspect-aware hidden states which are tailored
   for the ABSA task. In these aspect-aware context encoders, the semantics
   of the given aspect is used to regulate the information flow.
   Consequently, the aspect-related information can be retained and
   aspect-irrelevant information can be excluded in the generated hidden
   states. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
   with empirical analysis, demonstrating the efficacies and advantages of
   our proposed aspect-aware context encoders.

AB In steerable filters, a filter of arbitrary orientation can be generated
   by a linear combination of a set of "basis filters." Steerable
   properties dominate the design of the traditional filters, e.g., Gabor
   filters and endow features the capability of handling spatial
   transformations. However, such properties have not yet been well
   explored in the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). In this
   paper, we develop a new deep model, namely, Gabor convolutional networks
   (GCNs or Gabor CNNs), with Gabor filters incorporated into DCNNs such
   that the robustness of learned features against the orientation and
   scale changes can be reinforced. By manipulating the basic element of
   DCNNs, i.e., the convolution operator, based on Gabor filters, GCNs can
   be easily implemented and are readily compatible with any popular deep
   learning architecture. We carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate
   the promising performance of our GCNs framework, and the results show
   its superiority in recognizing objects, especially when the scale and
   rotation changes take place frequently. Moreover, the proposed GCNs have
   much fewer network parameters to be learned and can effectively reduce
   the training complexity of the network, leading to a more compact deep
   learning model while still maintaining a high feature representation
   capacity.

AB The TabZIP15 gene encoding a 396 amino acid (aa) polypeptide in the
   fungus Trichoderma asperellum ACCC30536 was cloned and characterised.
   The protein includes a basic region motif (NR-x2-QR-x2-R) and has a
   pillar-like structure. The 25 basic region/leucine zipper transcription
   factors (TFs) identified in the T. asperellum genome were divided into
   YAP (14 TFs), ATF2 (5), GCN4 (2), Zip1 (2), BRLZ (1) and u1 (1)
   subfamilies based on conserved domains. T. asperellum was cultured in
   minimal media (MM) control, C-Hungry and N-Hungry medium (to simulate
   nutrient competition and interaction with pathogens, respectively), and
   differential expression analysis showed that 14 TabZIP genes (including
   TabZIP15) were significantly altered under both conditions; TabZIP23
   responded strongly to N-Hungry media and TabZIP24 responded strongly to
   C-Hungry media. However, only YAP genes TabZIP15, TabZIP12 and TabZIP2
   were significantly upregulated under both conditions, and expression
   levels of TabZIP15 were highest. T. asperellum was also cultured in the
   presence of five fungal pathogenic toxins, and RT-qPCR results showed
   that TabZIP15 was significantly upregulated in four of the five toxin
   stress conditions (MM+Rhizoctonia solani, MM+Fusarium oxysporum,
   MM+Alternaria alternata and MM+Cytospora chrysosperma).

AB PurposeMoney laundering is the process of concealing unlawfully obtained
   funds by presenting them as coming from a legitimate source. Criminals
   use crypto money laundering to hide the illicit origin of funds using a
   variety of methods. The most simplified form of bitcoin money laundering
   leans hard on the fact that transactions made in cryptocurrencies are
   pseudonymous, but open data gives more power to investigators and
   enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. With the motive to curb
   these illegal activities, there exist various rules, policies and
   technologies collectively known as anti-money laundering (AML) tools.
   When properly implemented, AML restrictions reduce the negative effects
   of illegal economic activity while also promoting financial market
   integrity and stability, but these bear high costs for institutions. The
   purpose of this work is to motivate the opportunity to reconcile the
   cause of safety with that of financial inclusion, bearing in mind the
   limitations of the available data. The authors use the Elliptic dataset;
   to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the largest labelled
   transaction dataset publicly available in any
   cryptocurrency.Design/methodology/approachAML in bitcoin can be modelled
   as a node classification task in dynamic networks. In this work, graph
   convolutional decision forest will be introduced, which combines the
   potentialities of evolving graph convolutional network and deep neural
   decision forest (DNDF). This model will be used to classify the unknown
   transactions in the Elliptic dataset. Additionally, the application of
   knowledge distillation (KD) over the proposed approach gives finest
   results compared to all the other experimented techniques.FindingsThe
   importance of utilising a concatenation between dynamic graph learning
   and ensemble feature learning is demonstrated in this work. The results
   show the superiority of the proposed model to classify the illicit
   transactions in the Elliptic dataset. Experiments also show that the
   results can be further improved when the system is fine-tuned using a KD
   framework.Originality/valueExisting works used either ensemble learning
   or dynamic graph learning to tackle the problem of AML in bitcoin. The
   proposed model provides a novel view to combine the power of random
   forest with dynamic graph learning methods. Furthermore, the work also
   demonstrates the advantage of KD in improving the performance of the
   whole system.

AB Tailoring various micro-nano structured materials by employing different
   techniques to enhance their porosity and conductivity has captivated
   significant consideration, making their remarkable electrochemical
   properties accessible within the area of energy storage devices. Herein
   we report the impact of graphitic carbon nitride concentration (0.03
   similar to 0.1 g) on nickel-cobalt sulfide morphologies and performance
   in hydrogen production. Employing the facile hydrothermal method, a
   cubic crystalline nickel-cobalt sulfide was stabilized on defective
   layered graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets for overall water splitting.
   A performance peak was observed in a sample with a graphitic carbon
   nitride concentration of 50 mg, which not only prevented the
   agglomeration but also provided a porous structure for enhanced gas
   diffusivity and charge transfer rates owing to the synergistic Carbon
   and Nitrogen bonding with Cobalt and Nickel Sulfide. Optimized
   concentration of graphitic carbon nitride also increased the
   electrocatalytic active surface area threefold when compared with
   nickel-cobalt sulfide. The fabricated well-aligned flower-like pattern
   CoNi2S4/graphitic carbon nitride (50 mg) delivered a low overpotential
   of 310 mV and 160 mV for oxygen evolution reactions and hydrogen
   evolution reactions to reach a current density of 30 mA/cm(2) and 10
   mA/cm(2) in alkaline media. The electrolyzer displayed an electrolysis
   potential of 1.58 V to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current density with the
   long-term durability of 24 h. This strategy depicts a novel approach for
   utilizing this renowned nickel-cobalt sulfide with graphitic carbon
   nitride catalyst for the application of alkaline electrocatalytic water
   splitting.

   successfully demonstrated, exhibiting a wide linear range (0.1-52.1 lM),
   low detection limit (-0.02 lM), significant stability and selectivity,
   as well as reliable analysis in real samples. Moreover, efficient
   photocatalytic degradation with a high removing efficiency (-87%) toward
   4-CP is also achieved, outperforming its counterpart of Au nanoparticles
   (NPs) modified graphitic carbon nitride (Au/g-CN,-59%). This work paves
   a new way for efficient and simultaneous detection and remediation of
   organic pollutants over versatile photoactive catalysts.(c) 2022

AB The directed evolution of antibodies has yielded important research
   tools and human therapeutics. The dependence of many antibodies on
   disulfide bonds for stability has limited the application of continuous
   evolution technologies to antibodies and other disulfide-containing
   proteins. Here we describe periplasmic phage-assisted continuous
   evolution (pPACE), a system for continuous evolution of protein-protein
   interactions in the disulfide-compatible environment of the E. coli
   periplasm. We first apply pPACE to rapidly evolve novel noncovalent and
   covalent interactions between subunits of homodimeric YibK protein and
   to correct a binding-defective mutant of the anti-GCN4 omega-graft
   antibody. We develop an intein-mediated system to select for soluble
   periplasmic expression in pPACE, leading to an eight-fold increase in
   soluble expression of the omega-graft antibody. Finally, we evolve
   disulfide-containing trastuzumab antibody variants with improved binding
   to a Her2-like peptide and improved soluble expression. Together, these
   results demonstrate that pPACE can rapidly optimize proteins containing
   disulfide bonds, broadening the applicability of continuous evolution.
   The directed evolution of antibodies yields important tools for research
   and therapy. Here the authors develop a periplasmic phage-assisted
   continuous evolution platform for improvement of protein-protein
   interactions in the disulfidecompatible E. coli periplasm.

AB Age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share some common features such as
   cognitive impairments, memory loss, metabolic disturbances, bioenergetic
   deficits, and inflammation. Yet little is known on how systematic shifts
   in metabolic networks depend on age and AD. In this work, we
   investigated the global metabolomic alterations in non-transgenic (NTg)
   and triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse brain hippocampus as a function of
   age by using untargeted Ultrahigh Performance Liquid
   Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). We observed common
   metabolic patterns with aging in both NTg and 3xTg-AD brains involved in
   energy-generating pathways, fatty acids oxidation, glutamate, and
   sphingolipid metabolism. We found age-related downregulation of
   metabolites from reactions in glycolysis that consumed ATP and in the
   TCA cycle, especially at NAD(+)/NADH-dependent redox sites, where
   age-and AD-associated limitations in the free NADH may alter reactions.
   Conversely, metabolites increased in glycolytic reactions in which ATP
   is produced. With age, inputs to the TCA cycle were increased including
   fatty acid beta-oxidation and glutamine. Overall age- and AD-related
   changes were > 2-fold when comparing the declines of upstream
   metabolites of NAD(+)/NADH-dependent reactions to the increases of
   downstream metabolites (p = 10(-5), n = 8 redox reactions). Inflammatory
   metabolites such as ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate also increased
   with age. Age-related decreases in glutamate, GABA, and sphingolipid
   were seen which worsened with AD genetic load in 3xTg-AD brains,
   possibly contributing to synaptic, learning- and memory-related
   deficits. The data support the novel hypothesis that age-and
   AD-associated metabolic shifts respond to NAD(P)(+)/NAD(P)H
   redox-dependent reactions, which may contribute to decreased energetic
   capacity.

AB Resistance spot welding (RSW) is widely used in manufacturing processes
   of automobiles, aircraft, high-speed trains and other equipment, its
   appearance quality not only affects the product appearance, but also
   reflects the internal defects of welding spots and the health statuses
   of welding equipment to a great extent. Nowadays, a few researchers have
   tried to use deep learning algorithms to detect the appearance qualities
   of welding spots, however, the relationships between defect types and
   welding spot positions are ignored and the subtle visual differences
   among different welding spots are not fully utilized. To this end, a
   fine-grained flexible graph convolution network (FFGCN) is proposed for
   vision inspection of resistance spot welds in this paper, which combines
   natural language processing with computer vision. Specifically, the
   prior knowledge of relationships between weld appearance qualities and
   their positions is mapped to point-wise space by knowledge graph, so the
   features in point-wise space can be mined by a flexible graph
   convolution network (FGCN). In the FGCN, multihead attention mechanism
   is adopted to adaptively update the probabilistic matrix to generate
   multiple subgraphs, expand the spatial dimensions and increase feature
   information. Meanwhile, the optical features of weld images are
   excavated by a fine-grained network, in which the receptive field of
   model is enlarged and the number of pixels is ensured by dense atrous
   convolution. Besides, subtle visual differences between welding spots
   are captured by the bilinear attention convolution. Finally, the
   features in point-wise space and the visual features are combined by dot
   product to classify the appearances of welds. A six classification
   experiment for the vision inspection of resistance spot welds from
   engineering practice is implemented, results show that the proposed
   FFGCN has outstanding effect on the inspection of weld appearance
   qualities, it possesses faster convergence, more robustness, and its
   accuracy reaches 97.5%, which is higher than the commonly used visual
   classification algorithms.

AB Video question answering (VideoQA) is a challenging video understanding
   task that requires a comprehensive understanding of multimodal
   information and accurate answers to related questions. Most existing
   VideoQA models use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture
   temporal-spatial interactions between objects. Despite achieving certain
   success, we argue that current schemes have two limitations: (i)
   existing graph-based methods require stacking multi-layers of GNN to
   capture high-order relations between objects, which inevitably
   introduces irrelevant noise; (ii) neglecting the unique self-supervised
   signals in the high-order relational structures among multiple objects
   that can facilitate more accurate QA. To this end, we propose a novel
   Multi-scale Self-supervised Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MSHCL)
   framework for VideoQA. Specifically, we first segment the video from
   multiple temporal dimensions to obtain multiple frame groups. For
   different frame groups, we design appearance and motion hyperedges based
   on node semantics to connect object nodes. In this way, we construct a
   multi-scale temporal-spatial hypergraph to directly capture high-order
   relations among multiple objects. Furthermore, the node features after
   hypergraph convolution are injected into a Transformer to capture the
   global information of the input sequence. Second, we design a
   self-supervised hypergraph contrastive learning task based on the node-
   and hyperedge-dropping data augmentation and an improved question-guided
   multimodal interaction module to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
   the VideoQA model. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark
   datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MSHCL compared with
   stat-of-the-art methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanisms by which Candida glabrata resists host defense peptides
   and caspofungin are incompletely understood. To identify transcriptional
   regulators that enable C. glabrata to withstand these classes of
   stressors, a library of 215 C. glabrata transcriptional regulatory
   deletion mutants was screened for susceptibility to both protamine and
   caspofungin. We identified eight mutants that had increased
   susceptibility to both host defense peptides and caspofungin. Of these
   mutants, six were deleted for genes that were predicted to specify
   proteins involved in histone modification. These genes were ADA2, GCN5,
   SPT8, HOS2, RPD3, and SPP1. Deletion of ADA2, GCN5, and RPD3 also
   increased susceptibility to mammalian host defense peptides. The Delta
   ada2 and Delta gcn5 mutants had increased susceptibility to other
   stressors, such as H2O2 and SDS. In the Galleria mellonella model of
   disseminated infection, the Delta ada2 and Delta gcn5 mutants had
   attenuated virulence, whereas in neutropenic mice, the virulence of the
   Delta ada2 and Delta rpd3 mutants was decreased. Thus, histone
   modification plays a central role in enabling C. glabrata to survive
   host defense peptides and caspofungin, and Ada2 and Rpd3 are essential
   for the maximal virulence of this organism during disseminated
   infection.

AB The integration of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and catalytic
   membrane for filtration and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was
   appealing for persistent organic pollutants removal. However,
   constructing a robust catalytic membrane with high reactivity and
   stability is highly desirable and still challenging. Herein, a kind of
   novel lawn-like Co3O4@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube composites
   (Co3O4@NCNTs) by the pyrolysis of ZIF-67 in-situ grown on g-C3N4 was
   unprecedentedly designed, and then immobilized into protonated g-C3N4
   (gCN) membrane to construct Co3O4@NCNTs/g-CN membrane by vacuum-assisted
   filtration, where active sites were completely exposed for oxidants and
   target pollutants. As expected, the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole
   (SMX, 20 mg/L) in Co3O4@NCNTs-0.5 (0.01 g/L)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS, 0.2
   g/L) system was 0.2224 min- 1, which was 35.9 times higher than that of
   Co3O4@NCs (0.0062 min- 1) derived from ZIF-67. Besides, it was found
   that the introduction of lawn-like Co3O4@NCNTs significantly improved
   the surface hydrophilicity of g-CN membrane, consequently, the
   permeation flux of the Co3O4@NCNTs/g-CN membrane showed a 16.7 folds
   increase. Ultimately, the synergistic degradation and filtration process
   of catalytic membrane not only exhibited superior catalytic and
   self-cleaning property in humic acid (HA)/SMX coexistence system, but
   also significantly reduced the leaching concentration of Co2+ (0.016
   mg/L) after 5 runs compared to that of Co3O4@NCs/PMS system (0.041
   mg/L), demonstrating improved stability and reusability. Furthermore.
   scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests
   verified that the SMX degradation was dominated for the coexistence of
   multiple reactive active species (ROS, SO4 center dot-, center dot OH
   and 1O2) while 1O2 was a major contributor. Overall, this work offered
   new prospects in developing novel catalytic self-cleaning membrane.

AB Since COVID-19 emerged in 2019, significant levels of suffering and
   disruption have been caused on a glo-bal scale. Although vaccines have
   become widely used, the virus has shown its potential for evading
   immunities or acquiring other novel characteristics. Whether current
   drug treatments are still effective for people infected with Omicron
   remains unclear. Due to the long development cycles and high expense
   requirements of de novo drug development, many researchers have turned
   to consider drug repositioning in the search to find effective
   treatments for COVID-19. Here, we review such drug repositioning and
   combination efforts towards providing better handling. For potential
   drugs under consideration, aspects of both structure and function
   require attention, with specific categories of sequence, expression,
   struc-ture, and interaction, the key parameters for investigation. For
   different data types, we show the corre-sponding differing drug
   repositioning methods that have been exploited. As incorporating drug
   combinations can increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity, we
   also review computational strate-gies to reveal drug combination
   potential. Taken together, we found that graph theory and neural
   net-work were the most used strategy with high potential towards drug
   repositioning for COVID-19. Integrating different levels of data may
   further improve the success rate of drug repositioning. (c) 2022 The

   abstraction and generalization of real space. However, conventional DL
   models typically merely focus on temporal features when analyzing
   Euclidean data. These approaches ignore the spatial relationships of
   different leads, which are physiologically significant and useful for
   CVD diagnosis because different leads represent activities of specific
   heart regions. These relationships derived from spatial distributions of
   electrodes can be conveniently created in non-Euclidean data, making
   multi-lead ECGs better conform to their nature. Considering graph
   convolutional network (GCN) adept at analyzing non-Euclidean data, a
   novel spatial-temporal residual GCN for CVD diagnosis is proposed in
   this work. ECG signals are firstly divided into single-channel patches
   and transferred into nodes, which will be connected by spatial-temporal
   connections. The proposed model employs residual GCN blocks and
   feed-forward networks to alleviate over-smoothing and over-fitting.
   Moreover, residual connections and patch dividing enable the capture of
   global and detailed spatial-temporal features. Experimental results
   reveal that the proposed model achieves at least a 5.85% and 6.80%
   increase in F-1 over other state-of-the-art algorithms with similar
   parameters and computations in both PTB-XL and Chapman databases. It
   indicates that the proposed model provides a promising avenue for
   intelligent diagnosis with limited computing resources.

AB Mesh is a type of data structure commonly used for 3-D shapes.
   Representation learning for 3-D meshes is essential in many computer
   vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the
   value of adapting insights from CNN for 3-D shapes. However, 3-D shape
   data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various
   graph neural networks for 3-D shapes have been developed with isotropic
   filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node
   inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local
   coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this article, we
   propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation
   (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each template's
   node according to its neighboring structure and performs shared
   anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar
   to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer--a new Transformer
   model for natural language processing (NLP). Since the learnable
   weighting matrices require large amounts of parameters for
   high-resolution 3-D shapes, we introduce a matrix factorization
   technique to notably reduce the parameter size, denoted as LSA-small.
   Furthermore, a residual connection with a linear transformation is
   introduced to improve the performance of our LSA-Conv. Comprehensive
   experiments demonstrate that our model produces significant improvement
   in 3-D shape reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB The stilbenoid pathway is responsible for the production of resveratrol
   in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). A few transcription factors (TFs) have
   been identified as regulators of this pathway but the extent of this
   control has not been deeply studied. Here we show how DNA affinity
   purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) allows for the genome-wide TF-binding
   site interrogation in grape. We obtained 5190 and 4443 binding events
   assigned to 4041 and 3626 genes for MYB14 and MYB15, respectively
   (approximately 40% of peaks located within -10 kb of transcription start
   sites). DAP-Seq of MYB14/MYB15 was combined with aggregate gene
   co-expression networks (GCNs) built from more than 1400 transcriptomic
   datasets from leaves, fruits, and flowers to narrow down bound genes to
   a set of high confidence targets. The analysis of MYB14, MYB15, and
   MYB13, a third uncharacterized member of Subgroup 2 (S2), showed that in
   addition to the few previously known stilbene synthase (STS) targets,
   these regulators bind to 30 of 47 STS family genes. Moreover, all three
   MYBs bind to several PAL, C4H, and 4CL genes, in addition to shikimate
   pathway genes, the WRKY03 stilbenoid co-regulator and
   resveratrol-modifying gene candidates among which ROMT2-3 were validated
   enzymatically. A high proportion of DAP-Seq bound genes were induced in
   the activated transcriptomes of transient MYB15-overexpressing grapevine
   leaves, validating our methodological approach for delimiting TF
   targets. Overall, Subgroup 2 R2R3-MYBs appear to play a key role in
   binding and directly regulating several primary and secondary metabolic
   steps leading to an increased flux towards stilbenoid production. The
   integration of DAP-Seq and reciprocal GCNs offers a rapid framework for
   gene function characterization using genome-wide approaches in the
   context of non-model plant species and stands up as a valid first
   approach for identifying gene regulatory networks of specialized
   metabolism.

AB Dietary phytochemicals are currently being studied with great interest
   due to their ability to regulate the epigenome resulting in prevention
   of cancer. Some natural botanicals have been reported to have enhanced
   and synergistic impact on cancer suppression when administered at
   optimum concentrations and in-conjunction. Sulforaphane (SFN) is an
   isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables and sodium butyrate (NaB)
   is a short chain fatty acid produced by gut microbiota. They have been
   intensively explored due to numerous anti cancerous properties and
   ability to modulate epigenetic machinery by inhibition of histone
   deacetylase (HDAC). Genistein (GE), present in soy, is a known DNA
   methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. While combined chemoprotective
   epigenetic effects induced by SFN and GE have been investigated, the key
   impact of combinatorial SFN-NaB, GE-NaB, and SFN-GE-NaB bioactive
   components in regulation of various mechanisms are poorly defined. In
   the present study, we found that combinations of dietary compounds had
   synergistic effects in decreasing cellular viability at lower dosages
   than their single dosages in breast cancer cell lines. The respective
   combinations limited growth and increased apoptosis and necrosis in
   cancerous cells among which the tricombination displayed the most
   significant impact. Additionally, the respective combinations of
   compounds arrested MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells at G2/M
   phase. Our further mechanistic evaluation revealed that respective
   di-combinations and tri-combination had higher impact in down-regulation
   of DNMTs (DNMT3A and DNMT3B), HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC6 and HDAC11), histone
   methyltransferases (EZH2 and SUV39H1) and histone acetyltransferases
   (GCN5, PCAF, P300 and CBP) levels as compared to singly administered
   compounds. We also found that these combinations exhibited global
   epigenetic changes by inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activity, histone H3
   at lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me) and histone H3 at lysine 9
   methylation (H3K9me) levels, and by induction of histone
   acetyltransferases activity. Collectively, our investigation indicates
   that combined SFN, GE and NaB is highly effective in inhibiting breast
   cancer genesis by, at least in part, regulating epigenetic
   modifications, which may have implications in breast cancer therapy.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), as a nonmetal semiconductor material,
   has been widely used in various fields, such as photocatalysis,
   electrocatalysis, batteries, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells,
   owing to its unique electronic and photophysical properties. However,
   the application of g-CN in practical devices remains limited because of
   the difficulties in fabricating g-CN films of high quality. In this
   work, we report a method for preparing a g-CN film with high optical
   quality on a substrate of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and/or soda lime
   (NaCa) glass by using melamine as a precursor. First, we prepared the
   bulk g-CN from melamine in a muffle furnace via thermal polymerization.
   Then, we fabricated the g-CN film on the ITO and/or NaCa glass substrate
   with fine-milled, bulk g-CN in a tube furnace using thermal vapor
   deposition. With this two-step method, a yellow, transparent g-CN film
   with high optical quality was successfully fabricated on both the ITO
   and/or NaCa glass substrates. To check the quality of the film, we used
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study the morphology of the
   fabricated gCN film on the ITO glass substrate. Both the high-resolution
   and low-resolution SEM image results show that the obtained g-CN film on
   the ITO glass substrate had a homogeneous and dense structure without a
   corrugated surface, illustrating that it had good surface roughness.
   Then, we investigated the thickness and surface roughness of the g-CN
   film via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM results show that the
   thickness of the g-CN film deposited on the ITO glass substrate was
   around 300 nm and that the surface roughness of the g-CN film deposited
   on the ITO glass substrate was less than 40 nm. To verify the chemical
   composition of the obtained g-CN film on the ITO glass substrate, we
   performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. Both the XPS and EDS results demonstrate
   that the chemical composition of the g-CN film deposited on the ITO
   glass substrate was similar to that of bulk g-CN powder. More
   importantly, we determined the band structure for the g-CN film
   deposited on the ITO glass substrate by using a combination of
   steady-state absorption and high-resolution valence band XPS analysis.
   It was found that the determined band structure for the g-CN film
   deposited on the ITO glass substrate was close to that of bulk g-CN
   powder, also indicating that its chemical composition was similar to
   that of bulk g-CN. Meanwhile, we also found that the prepared g-CN film
   on the ITO glass substrate effectively degraded methylene blue dye under
   Xe lamp irradiation, which was similar to the effect of bulk g-CN
   powder. All analyses performed demonstrate that the two-step method
   presented in this study could successfully fabricate a g-CN film with
   high optical quality. In addition, we also analyzed the fluorescence
   lifetime of the g-CN film deposited on the ITO glass substrate by using
   a homemade time-correlated single-photon counting apparatus and found
   that it was much shorter than that of bulk g-CN.

AB A series of complex transport, storage and regulation mechanisms control
   iron metabolism and thereby maintain iron homeostasis in plants. Despite
   several studies on iron deficiency responses in different plant species,
   these mechanisms remain unclear in the allohexaploid wheat, which is the
   most widely cultivated commercial crop. We used RNA sequencing to reveal
   transcriptomic changes in the wheat flag leaves and roots, when
   subjected to iron limited conditions. We identified 5969 and 2591
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the flag leaves and roots,
   respectively. Genes involved in the synthesis of iron ligands i.e.,
   nicotianamine (NA) and deoxymugineic acid (DMA) were significantly
   up-regulated during iron deficiency. In total, 337 and 635 genes
   encoding transporters exhibited altered expression in roots and flag
   leaves, respectively. Several genes related to MAJOR FACILITATOR
   SUPERFAMILY (MFS), ATP-BINDING CASSETTE (ABC) transporter superfamily,
   NATURAL RESISTANCE ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGE PROTEIN (NRAMP) family and
   OLIGOPEPTIDE TRANSPORTER (OPT) family were regulated, indicating their
   important roles in combating iron deficiency stress. Among the
   regulatory factors, the genes encoding for transcription factors of
   BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX (bHLH) family were highly up-regulated in both
   roots and the flag leaves. The jasmonate biosynthesis pathway was
   significantly altered but with notable expression differences between
   roots and flag leaves. Homoeologs expression and induction bias analysis
   revealed subgenome specific differential expression. Our findings
   provide an integrated overview on regulated molecular processes in
   response to iron deficiency stress in wheat. This information could
   potentially serve as a guideline for breeding iron deficiency stress
   tolerant crops as well as for designing appropriate wheat iron
   biofortification strategies. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

AB Background: The LA hybrid lily Aladdin' has both excellent traits of
   Longiflorum hybrids and Asiatic hybridssuch as big and vivid flower,
   strong stem, high self-propagation coefficient, and shorter low
   temperature time required to release bulb dormancy in contrast to
   Oriental hybrids. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis using
   transcriptome RNA-Seq was performed in order to explore whether there is
   a gibberellin floral induction pathway in the LA hybrid lily.
   Subsequently, gene co-expression network analysis was used to analyze
   the possible interactions of key candidate genes screened from
   transcriptome data. At the same time, a series of physiological,
   biochemical, and cultivation tests were carried out. Results: The
   content of five endogenous hormones changed sharply in the shoot apex
   during the treatment of 200 mg/L exogenous gibberellin and the ratio of
   ABA/GA(3) dropped and stayed at a lower level after 4 hours' treatment
   from the higher levels initially, reaching a dynamic balance. In
   addition, the metabolism of carbohydrates in the bulbs increase during
   exogenous gibberellin treatment. A total of 124,041 unigenes were
   obtained by RNA-seq. With the transcriptome analysis, 48,927 unigenes
   and 48,725 unigenes respectively aligned to the NR database and the
   Uniprot database. 114,138 unigenes, 25,369 unigenes, and 19,704 unigenes
   respectively aligned to the COG, GO, and KEGG databases. 2148
   differentially expression genes (DEGs) were selected with the indicators
   RPKM 0, FDR 0.05 and |log2(ratio)| 2. The number of the upregulated
   unigenes was significantly more than the number of the downregulated
   unigenes. Some MADS-box genes related to flowering transformationsuch as
   AGL20, SOC1, and COwere found to be upregulated. A large number of
   gibberellin biosynthesis related genes such as GA2ox, GA3ox, GA20ox,
   Cytochrome P450, CYP81, and gibberellin signal transduction genes such
   as DELLA, GASA, and GID1 were significantly differentially expressed.
   The plant hormones related genes such as NCED3 and sugar metabolism
   related genes such as -amylase, sucrose synthase hexokinase, and so on
   were also found expressing differentially. In addition, stress
   resistance related genes such as LEA1, LEA2, LEA4, serine/threonine
   protein kinase, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinase, P34
   kinase, histidine kinase 3 and epigenetic related genes in DNA
   methylation, histone methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination of ribose
   were also found. Particularly, a large number of transcription factors
   responsive to the exogenous gibberellin signal including WRKY40, WRKY33,
   WRKY27, WRKY21, WRKY7, MYB, AP2/EREBP, bHLH, NAC1, NAC2, and NAC11 were
   found to be specially expressing. 30 gene sequences were selected from a
   large number of differentially expressed candidate genes for qRT-PCR
   expression verification (0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h) and compared with the
   transcriptome expression levels. Conclusions: 200mg/L exogenous GA(3)
   can successfully break the bulb's dormancy of the LA hybrid lily and
   significantly accelerated the flowering process, indicating that
   gibberellin floral induction pathway is present in the LA lily Aladdin'.
   With the GCNs analysis, two second messenger G protein-coupled receptor
   related genes that respond to gibberellin signals in the cell were
   discovered. The downstream transport proteins such as AMT, calcium
   transport ATPase, and plasma membrane ATPase were also discovered
   participating in GA signal transduction.
   Transcription factors including WRKY7, NAC2, NAC11, and CBF specially
   regulated phosphorylation and glycosylation during the ubiquitination
   degradation process of DELLA proteins. These transcription factors also
   activated in abscisic acid metabolism. A large number of transcription
   factors such as WRKY21, WRKY22, NAC1, AP2, EREB1, P450, and CYP81 that
   both regulate gibberellin signaling and low-temperature signals have
   also been found. Finally, the molecular mechanism of GA floral induction
   pathway in the LA hybrid lily Aladdin' was constructed.

AB Background The prognostic value of preoperative systemic inflammatory
   markers, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),
   platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio
   (LMR), remains controversial in patients with intrahepatic
   cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to
   investigate the prognostic value of preoperative NLR, PLR, and LMR in
   patients with ICC who underwent hepatic resection. Methods We conducted
   a comprehensive search of four electronic databases. Two researchers
   assessed the quality of the available data using the Newcastle-Ottawa
   Scale. We selected overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome and
   recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) as
   secondary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were merged to evaluate the associations between inflammatory
   markers and ICC patient prognosis. Results Fifteen studies (18 cohorts)
   with 4123 cases were included in this meta-analysis. The results
   revealed that a high preoperative NLR was associated with short OS and
   RFS (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07, and HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.60,
   respectively) in patients with ICC. However, the association between PLR
   or LMR and ICC prognosis was not statistically significant. In addition,
   the publication bias and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the

TI GCN2 Deficiency Enhances Protective Effects of Exercise on Hepatic

AB Background. Combined aerobic and resistance training has been
   demonstrated to benefit glycemic control and reverse nonalcoholic fatty
   liver disease in childhood obesity. General control nonderepressible 2
   (GCN2) deficiency has been reported to attenuate hepatic steatosis and
   insulin resistance. However, whether GCN2 impacts the positive effects
   of combined aerobic and resistance exercise remains unknown. Objectives.
   To investigate whether combined aerobic and resistance exercise improves
   hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance and the role GCN2 plays in
   mediating the metabolic regulation of exercise. Methods. Wild-type (WT)
   and GCN2 knockout (GCN2KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 25
   weeks. The WT and GCN2KO mice performed exercise (treadmill running +
   ladder climbing) during the last eight weeks. Their body and liver
   weights, their triglyceride content, and their levels of aspartate
   transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and blood glucose were
   measured, and the expressions of proteins involved in the GCN2/eIF2
   alpha/ATF4 pathway and the glucolipid metabolism-related proteins (e.g.,
   p-AMPK, SIRT1, PPAR alpha, PGC-1 alpha, GLUT4, and p-GSK-3 beta) were
   determined. Results. The body weight of WT and GCN2KO mice continued to
   increase until the end of the experiment. The liver weights, hepatic
   triglyceride content, and AST and ALT levels of the exercised mice were
   significantly reduced compared to those of the sedentary mice. Exercise
   improved blood glucose levels and glucose clearance ability in the WT
   mice, but the glucose intolerance of GCN2KO mice was not improved.
   Exercise increased PGC-1 alpha, GLUT4, and p-GSK-3 beta expressions in
   the WT rather than the GCN2KO mice. Interestingly however,
   exercise-trained GCN2KO mice were better protected against hepatic
   steatosis with downregulated expressions of p-eIF2 alpha and ATF4,
   upregulated expressions of p-AMPK and SIRT1, and the presence of PPAR
   alpha in the liver, compared to the exercised WT mice. Conclusion.
   Combined aerobic and resistance exercise had positive effects on hepatic
   steatosis and the control of glucose intolerance. GCN2 was found to be
   necessary for exercise-induced improved glucose intolerance. However,
   the better efficacy in improving hepatic steatosis by exercise in the
   GCN2-deficient mice enhanced liver lipid metabolism, at least partially,
   via the AMPK/SIRT1/PPAR alpha pathway.

AB The integrated stress response in eukaryotic cells is an orchestrated
   pathway that leads to eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2
   alpha) phosphorylation at ser51 and ultimately activates pathways to
   mitigate cellular damages. Three putative kinases (Tck1, Tck2, and Tck3)
   are found in the Trypanosoma cruzi genome, the flagellated parasite that
   causes Chagas disease. These kinases present similarities to other
   eukaryotic eIF2 alpha kinases, exhibiting a typical insertion loop in
   the kinase domain of the protein. We found that this insertion loop is
   conserved among kinase 1 of several T. cruzi strains but differs among
   various Kinetoplastidae species, suggesting unique roles. Kinase 1 is
   orthologous of GCN2 of several eukaryotes, which have been implicated in
   the eIF2 alpha ser51 phosphorylation in situations that mainly affects
   the nutrients levels. Therefore, we further investigated the responses
   to nutritional stress of T. cruzi devoid of TcK1 generated by
   CRISPR/Cas9 gene replacement. In nutrient-rich conditions, replicative
   T. cruzi epimastigotes depleted of TcK1 proliferate as wild type cells
   but showed increased levels of polysomes relative to monosomes. Upon
   nutritional deprivation, the polysomes decreased more than in TcK1
   depleted line. However, eIF2 alpha is still phosphorylated in TcK1
   depleted line, as in wild type parasites. eIF2 alpha phosphorylation
   increased at longer incubations times, but KO parasites showed less
   accumulation of ribonucleoprotein granules containing ATP-dependent RNA
   helicase involved in mRNA turnover (DHH1) and Poly-A binding protein
   (PABP1). Additionally, the formation of metacyclic-trypomastigotes is
   increased in the absence of Tck1 compared to controls. These
   metacyclics, as well as tissue culture trypomastigotes derived from the
   TcK1 knockout line, were less infective to mammalian host cells,
   although replicated faster inside mammalian cells. These results
   indicate that GCN2-like kinase in T. cruzi affects stress granule
   formation, independently of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation upon nutrient
   deprivation. It also modulates the fate of the parasites during
   differentiation, invasion, and intracellular proliferation.

AB Motivation: Evaluating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of
   drug molecules is a critical step in brain drug development. Traditional
   methods for the evaluation require complicated in vitro or in vivo
   testing. Alternatively, in silico predictions based on machine learning
   have proved to be a cost-efficient way to complement the in vitro and in
   vivo methods. However, the performance of the established models has
   been limited by their incapability of dealing with the interactions
   between drugs and proteins, which play an important role in the
   mechanism behind the BBB penetrating behaviors. To address this
   limitation, we employed the relational graph convolutional network
   (RGCN) to handle the drug-protein interactions as well as the properties
   of each individual drug.
   Results: The RGCN model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.872, an area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.919 and an area
   under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.838 for the testing
   dataset with the drug-protein interactions and the Mordred descriptors
   as the input. Introducing drug-drug similarity to connect structurally
   similar drugs in the data graph further improved the testing results,
   giving an overall accuracy of 0.876, an AUROC of 0.926 and an AUPRC of
   0.865. In particular, the RGCN model was found to greatly outperform the
   LightGBM base model when evaluated with the drugs whose BBB penetration
   was dependent on drug-protein interactions. Our model is expected to
   provide high-confidence predictions of BBB permeability for drug
   prioritization in the experimental screening of BBB-penetrating drugs.

AB In this trial, nine diets were formulated to investigate the effects of
   DL-methionine (DL-Met) and a methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA-Ca) on
   growth, amino acid profiles and the expression of genes related to
   taurine and protein synthesis in common carp. The basal diet was
   prepared without methionine supplementation and the other diets were
   formulated with 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.4% of DL-Met or MHA-Ca,
   respectively. After the eight-week feeding trial, fish fed with DL-Met
   or MHA-Ca supplemented diets had higher growth performance and feed
   utilization when compared with basal diet and two-way ANOVA showed the
   growth performance and feed utilization were significantly increased in
   fish fed DL-Met supplemented diets (P < 0.05). The concentrations of
   free amino acids in serum (Met, Leu, His, Lys, Val, Arg, Ile, Phe and
   Tau) and muscle (Tau) significantly increased as dietary DL-Met and
   MHA-Ca increased. Moreover, two-way ANOVA showed that taurine was higher
   in common carp fed with DL-Met diets compared with MHA-Ca diets. To find
   out how DL-Met and MHA-Ca affect taurine synthesis, genes involved in
   methionine degradation and taurine synthesis were further investigated.
   DL-Met or MHA-Ca supplementation decreased the expression of methionine
   adenosyltransferase II, alpha (MAT2A) and methionine synthase (MS) and
   increased the expression of the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO). Moreover,
   DL-Met supplementation significantly increased the expression of CDO and
   cysteine sulfinate acid decarboxylase (CSD) when compared with MHA-Ca
   supplementation. As for protein synthesis, the mRNA expression of
   mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in liver was not significantly
   different among all diet groups. But the expression of eukaryotic
   translation initiation factor 4E-Binding protein 1 (4EBP1), general
   control nonderepressible2 (GCN2) and asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in
   liver were significantly down-regulated as dietary DL-Met or MHA-Ca
   increased. Compared with MHA-Ca diets, the expression of S6 (ribosomal
   protein s6) and eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
   binding protein 2) were markedly elevated in DL-Met groups by the
   analysis of two-way ANOVA. This study indicated that dietary DL-Met or
   MHACa supplement could increase free essential amino acids in serum, as
   well as improve taurine synthesis and protein synthesis in common carp.
   Multi-exponential regression analysis showed that MHA-Ca was less
   utilized by common carp than DL-Met with bioavailability values of 41%
   to 50% on weight-for-weight basis.

AB The exopolysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG) plays an important
   role in mediating adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence in the
   pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Previous work showed that in A.
   fumigatus, the Lim domain-binding protein PtaB can form a complex with
   the sequence-specific transcription factor SomA for regulating GAG
   biosynthesis, biofilm formation, and asexual development. However,
   transcriptional coactivators required for biofilm formation in A.
   fumigatus remain uncharacterized. In this study, Spt20, an orthologue of
   the subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional coactivator
   Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, was identified as a
   regulator of biofilm formation and asexual development in A. fumigatus.
   The loss of spt20 caused severe defects in the GAG biosynthesis, biofilm
   formation, conidiation, and virulence of A. fumigatus. RNA sequence data
   demonstrated that Spt20 positively regulates the expression of the GAG
   biosynthesis genes uge3 and agd3, the developmental regulator medA, and
   genes involved in the conidiation pathway. Moreover, more than 10
   subunits of the SAGA complex (known from yeast) could be
   immunoprecipitated with Spt20, suggesting that Spt20 acts as a
   structural subunit of the SAGA complex. Furthermore, distinct modules of
   SAGA regulate GAG biosynthesis, biofilm formation, and asexual
   development in A. fumigatus to various degrees. In summary, the novel
   biofilm regulator Spt20 is reported, which plays a crucial role in the
   regulation of fungal asexual development, GAG biosynthesis, and
   virulence in A. fumigatus. These findings expand knowledge on the
   regulatory circuits of the SAGA complex relevant for the biofilm
   formation and asexual development of A. fumigatus.
   IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic transcription is regulated by a large number of
   proteins, ranging from sequence-specific DNA-binding factors to
   transcriptional coactivators (chromatin regulators and the general
   transcription machinery) and their regulators. Previous research
   indicated that the sequence-specific complex SomA/PtaB regulates the
   biofilm formation and asexual development of Aspergillus fumigatus.
   However, transcriptional coactivators working with sequence-specific
   transcription factors to regulate A. fumigatus biofilm formation remain
   uncharacterized. In this study, Spt20, an orthologue of the subunit of
   the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA)
   complex, was identified as a novel regulator of biofilm formation and
   asexual development in A. fumigatus. The loss of spt20 caused severe
   defects in galactosaminogalactan (GAG) production, conidiation, and
   virulence. Moreover, nearly all modules of the SAGA complex were
   required for the biofilm formation and asexual development of A.
   fumigatus. These results establish the SAGA complex as a transcriptional
   coactivator required for the biofilm formation and asexual development
   of A. fumigatus.

AB Annotating object boundaries by humans demands high costs. Recently,
   polygon-based annotation methods with human interaction have shown
   successful performance. However, given the connected vertex topology,
   these methods exhibit difficulty predicting the disconnected components
   in an object. This article introduces Split-GCN, a novel architecture
   based on the polygon approach and self-attention mechanism. By offering
   the direction information, Split-GCN enables the polygon's vertices to
   move more precisely to the object boundary. Our model successfully
   predicts disconnected components of an object by transforming the
   initial topology using the context exchange about the dependencies of
   vertices. Split-GCN demonstrates competitive performance with the
   state-of-the-art models on Cityscapes and even higher performance with
   the baseline models. On four cross-domain datasets, we confirm our
   model's generalization ability.

AB Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN) has been widely used in
   hyperspectral image (HSI) classification due to its satisfactory
   performance. However, the number of labeled pixels is very limited in
   HSI, and thus, the available supervision information is usually
   insufficient, which will inevitably degrade the representation ability
   of most existing GCN-based methods. To enhance the feature
   representation ability, in this article, a GCN model with contrastive
   learning is proposed to explore the supervision signals contained in
   both spectral information and spatial relations, which is termed
   contrastive GCN (ConGCN), for HSI classification. First, in order to
   mine sufficient supervision signals from spectral information, a
   semisupervised contrastive loss function is utilized to maximize the
   agreement between different views of the same node or the nodes from the
   same land cover category. Second, to extract the precious yet implicit
   spatial relations in HSI, a graph generative loss function is leveraged
   to explore supplementary supervision signals contained in the graph
   topology. In addition, an adaptive graph augmentation technique is
   designed to flexibly incorporate the spectral-spatial priors of HSI,
   which helps facilitate the subsequent contrastive representation
   learning. The extensive experimental results on six typical benchmark
   datasets firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ConGCN in
   both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

AB Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) to recognize new categories in a
   new domain with few samples has attracted significant attention.
   Recently, task-specific CD-FSL emerges as promising research for its
   great generalization. However, the existing task-specific CD-FSL methods
   are not robust enough in task context modeling and task-specific feature
   learning, especially under the cross-domain setting. To tackle this
   problem, a Task Context Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network
   (TCT-GCN) method for CD-FSL is proposed. The proposed TCT-GCN constructs
   three modules: 1) Multi-Level Feature Fusion, which fuses domain-shared

   Transformer-based Task Context Encoder, which models sample

AB The growth of the Internet of Things makes it possible to share
   information on risky vehicles openly and freely. How to create dynamic
   knowledge graphs of continually changing risky vehicles has emerged as a
   crucial technology for identifying risky vehicles, as well as a research
   hotspot in both artificial intelligence and field knowledge graphs. The
   node information of the risky vehicle knowledge graph is not rich, and
   the graph structure plays a major role in its dynamic changes. The paper
   presents a fusion algorithm based on relational graph convolutional
   network (R-GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to build the dynamic
   knowledge graph of risky vehicles and conducts a comparative experiment
   on the link prediction task. The results showed that the fusion
   algorithm based on R-GCN and LSTM had better performance than the other
   methods such as GCN, DynGEM, ROLAND, and RE-GCN, with the MAP value of
   0.2746 and the MRR value of 0.1075. To further verify the proposed
   algorithm, classification experiments are carried out on the risky
   vehicle dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-values were used as
   heat-tolerance evaluation indexes in classification experiments, the
   values were 0.667, 0.034, 0.422, and 0.52 respectively.

AB Solar-driven seawater electrolysis for hydrogen fuel production holds an
   outstanding potential towards the development of a carbon-neutral and
   sustainable energy infrastructure, but the development of green,
   efficient and stable photoelectrocatalysts selectively promoting oxygen
   evolution remains a formidable challenge. Motivated by this issue, in
   this work we propose a tailored combination of two economically viable
   materials, alpha-Fe2O3 and graphitic carbon nitride (gCN), to fabricate
   promising anodes - eventually decorated with cobalt phosphate (CoPi)
   particles - for alkaline seawater photosplitting. The target systems
   were fabricated via an original multi-step route, involving the
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of iron(iii) oxide on
   conducting glasses, the introduction of gCN in very small amounts by a
   rapid and facile electrophoretic process, and final annealing in air. A
   comprehensive characterization revealed the successful fabrication of
   composites featuring a tailored surface defectivity, a controlled
   nano-organization, and a close Fe2O3/gCN interfacial contact. After
   decoration with CoPi, the best performances corresponded to a Tafel
   slope of approximate to 100 mV dec-1 and overpotential values enabling
   us to rule out the competitive hypochlorite formation. In addition,
   photocurrent densities at 1.23 V vs. RHE showed a nearly 7-fold increase
   upon Fe2O3 functionalization with both gCN and CoPi. These amenable
   results, directly dependent on the electronic interplay at Fe2O3/gCN
   heterojunctions and on CoPi beneficial effects, are accompanied by a
   remarkable long-term stability, and may open up attractive avenues for
   clean energy production using natural resources.
   Sunlight-assisted seawater splitting can be successfully driven by
   specifically designed, cost-effective and eco-friendly Fe2O3-gCN
   electrocatalysts.

AB In this study, we aimed to develop an efficient photocatalyst utilizing
   a nanocomposite of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and graphitic carbon nitride
   (GCN) for the treatment of highly concentrated printing and dyeing
   wastewater. The nanocomposite of SiO2 and graphitic carbon nitride (GCN)
   was synthesized using a simple ultrasonic and solvothermal method. The
   SiO2/GCN nanocomposite demonstrated superior photocatalytic performance,
   efficiently degrading rhodamine B (RhB) at both low (20 mg L-1) and
   ultra-high concentrations (300 mg L-1). The catalyst exhibited effective
   charge separation, with SiO2 acting as an electron trap to suppress
   electron-hole recombination. Optimized synthesis conditions were
   achieved by adjusting the hydrothermal temperature and time. The
   SiO2/GCN nanocomposite showed good cycling stability, making it suitable
   for practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first time that photodegradation of RhB at a concentration of 300 mg L-1
   has been achieved without relying on adsorbent materials. Therefore,
   this work contributes to the design and development of innovative
   environmentally-friendly photocatalysts for the effective degradation of
   highly concentrated pollutants.

AB Probabilistic analysis tool is important to quantify the impacts of the
   uncertainties on power system operations. However, the repetitive
   calculations of power flow are time-consuming. To address this issue,
   data-driven approaches are proposed but they are not robust to the
   uncertain injections and varying topology. This article proposes a
   model-driven graph convolution neural network (MD-GCN) for power flow
   calculation with high-computational efficiency and good robustness to
   topology changes. Compared with the basic graph convolution neural
   network (GCN), the construction of MD-GCN considers the physical
   connection relationships among different nodes. This is achieved by
   embedding the linearized power flow model into the layer-wise
   propagation. Such a structure enhances the interpretability of the
   network forward propagation. To ensure that enough features are
   extracted in MD-GCN, a new input feature construction method with
   multiple neighborhood aggregations and a global pooling layer are
   developed. This allows us to integrate both global features and
   neighborhood features, yielding the complete features representation of
   the system-wide impacts on every single node. Numerical results on the
   IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems demonstrate that the
   proposed method achieves much better performance as compared to other
   approaches in the presence of uncertain power injections and system
   topology.

AB Learning hidden topics from data streams has become absolutely necessary
   but posed challenging problems such as concept drift as well as short
   and noisy data. Using prior knowledge to enrich a topic model is one of
   potential solutions to cope with these challenges. Prior knowledge that
   is derived from human knowledge (e.g. Wordnet) or a pre-trained model
   (e.g. Word2vec) is very valuable and useful to help topic models work
   better. However, in a streaming environment where data arrives
   continually and infinitely, existing studies are limited to exploiting
   these resources effectively. Especially, a knowledge graph, that
   contains meaningful word relations, is ignored. In this paper, to aim at
   exploiting a knowledge graph effectively, we propose a novel graph
   convolutional topic model (GCTM) which integrates graph convolutional
   networks (GCN) into a topic model and a learning method which learns the
   networks and the topic model simultaneously for data streams. In each
   minibatch, our method not only can exploit an external knowledge graph
   but also can balance the external and old knowledge to perform well on
   new data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method with
   both a human knowledge graph (Wordnet) and a graph built from
   pre-trained word embeddings (Word2vec). The experimental results show
   that our method achieves significantly better performances than
   state-of-the-art baselines in terms of probabilistic predictive measure
   and topic coherence. In particular, our method can work well when
   dealing with short texts as well as concept drift. (c) 2021 Elsevier

AB Underwater glider (UG) plays an important role in ocean observation and
   exploration for a more efficient and deeper understanding of complex
   ocean environment. Timely identifying the motion states of UG is
   conducive for timely attitude adjustment and detection of potential
   anomalies, thereby improving the working reliability of UG. Combining
   limited penetrable visibility graph (LPVG) and graph convolutional
   networks (GCN) with self-attention mechanisms, we propose a novel method
   for motion states identification of UG, which is called as visibility
   graph and self-attention mechanism-based graph convolutional network
   (VGSA-GCN). Based on the actual sea trial data of UG, we chose the
   attitude angle signals of motion states related sensors collected by the
   control system of UG as the research object and constructed complex
   networks based on the LPVG method from pitch angle, roll angle, and
   heading angle data in diving and climbing states. Then, we build a
   self-attention mechanism-based GCN framework and classify the graphs
   under different motion states constructed by a complex network. Compared
   with support vector machines, convolutional neural network, and GCN
   without self-attention pooling layer, the proposed VGSA-GCN method can
   more accurately distinguish the diving and climbing states of UG.
   Subsequently, we analyze the variation of the transitivity coefficient
   corresponding to these two motion states. The results suggest that the
   coordination of the various sensors in the attitude adjustment unit
   during diving becomes closer and more efficient, which corresponds to
   the higher network measure of the diving state compared to the climbing
   state.

AB Quality assessment of omnidirectional images has become increasingly
   urgent due to the rapid growth of virtual reality applications.
   Different from traditional 2D images and videos, omnidirectional
   contents can provide consumers with freely changeable viewports and a
   larger field of view covering the 360 degrees x 180 degrees spherical
   surface, which makes the objective quality assessment of omnidirectional
   images more challenging. In this paper, motivated by the characteristics
   of the human vision system (HVS) and the viewing process of
   omnidirectional contents, we propose a novel Viewport oriented Graph
   Convolution Network (VGCN) for blind omnidirectional image quality
   assessment (IQA). Generally, observers tend to give the subjective
   rating of a 360-degree image after passing and aggregating different
   viewports information when browsing the spherical scenery. Therefore, in
   order to model the mutual dependency of viewports in the omnidirectional
   image, we build a spatial viewport graph. Specifically, the graph nodes
   are first defined with selected viewports with higher probabilities to
   be seen, which is inspired by the HVS that human beings are more
   sensitive to structural information. Then, these nodes are connected by
   spatial relations to capture interactions among them. Finally, reasoning
   on the proposed graph is performed via graph convolutional networks.
   Moreover, we simultaneously obtain global quality using the entire
   omnidirectional image without viewport sampling to boost the performance
   according to the viewing experience. Experimental results demonstrate
   that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art full-reference and
   no-reference IQA metrics on two public omnidirectional IQA databases.

AB Now-a-days since number of vehicles are growing day by day on the roads
   in urban and metropolitan area, hence traffic jam is becoming very
   common problem which everyone is facing time to time. So it becomes very
   crucial to forecast traffic to avoid the regular traffic congestion
   situation in daily life. In today's intelligent traffic system, reliable
   and precise traffic forecasting in metropolitan road networks is
   critical. Many models based on classical methods have been presented to
   address this; however, they lag in certain circumstances, failing to
   incorporate spatial and temporal dependency in the environment. As a
   result, this research aims to solve the geographical and temporal
   dependency problem that plagues most traffic forecasting models. Graph
   Convolution Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are employed in
   conjunction with an attention-based model for more accurate traffic
   forecasts in cities. A combined model called Spatio-Temporal
   Attention-based Model with GCN and GRU (ST AGG) is employed to
   anticipate traffic. ST-AGG model mainly focuses on extracting the
   relevant information from all the input given to the attention-based
   model. The spatial dependency is determined by using GCN and the
   temporal dependency is determined by using GRU, used in the ST-AGG
   model. It assists in short-term traffic forecasting as well as long-term
   traffic forecasting. The results demonstrate that the suggested ST AGG
   has properly predicted the volume of traffic on city roadways in real
   time with greater accuracy. The model depicts how traffic is influenced
   by geography and time. The Shen Zhen (SZ) car dataset from China and the
   Los Angeles (LAS) dataset from California are used to test the suggested
   model. And the result shows that Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean
   Absolute Error (MAE) have reduced by up to 2.7% less, and accuracy has
   increased by 2.7% more compared to the previous model ST GCN for the SZ
   vehicle dataset. Similarly, although the accuracy has not changed
   significantly for the Loss Angeles data set, RMSE and MAE have reduced
   by 3.71% less as compared to the previous ST GCN model. The proposed
   model is more effective than the prior models like GCN, GRU, and ST GCN.

AB Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in
   power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing.
   The data in these tasks are typically represented in Euclidean domains.
   Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power
   systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and
   represented as graph-structured data with high-dimensional features and
   interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has
   brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks
   defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing
   deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have
   emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural
   networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several
   classical paradigms of GNN structures, e.g., graph convolutional
   networks, are summarized. Key applications in power systems such as
   fault scenario application, time-series prediction, power flow
   calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Furthermore,
   main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in
   power systems are discussed.

AB Flight delays pose a worldwide challenge that significantly affect the
   safety and efficiency of air transportation systems. However, propagated
   delay prediction, as well as its causality among airport delay
   propagation net-works, has not considered some crucial issues regarding
   spatiotemporal dependence and propagation relation-ships. Thus, this
   study proposes a transport causality knowledge-guided extended graph
   convolutional network (GCN) framework to tackle these issues. In
   particular, a causality knowledge-guided airport delay propagation
   network (ADPN) is developed using the second modified transfer entropy
   (SMTE) principle. Furthermore, a causality-embedded adjacency matrix is
   utilized by an extended GCN for propagated delay prediction.
   Comprehensive validations and results indicate that the proposed method
   benefits significantly from the cau-sality knowledge, and increases the
   prediction performances up to 15.51%. Thus, transport causality is
   signifi-cant and efficient for understanding propagated delay features
   and airport delay propagation network characteristics.

   personality traits from their Facebook status updates or essay
   information. Since the basic five personality traits (such as openness)
   and their aspects (such as status information) are related to a wide
   range of text features, this work takes the Big Five personality model
   as the core of the study. We construct a single user personality graph
   for the corpus based on user-document relations, document-word
   relations, and word co-occurrence and then learn the personality graph
   convolutional networks (personality GCN) for the user. The parameters or
   the inputs of our personality GCN are initialized with a one-hot
   representation for users, words and documents; then, under the
   supervision of users and documents with known class labels, it jointly
   learns the embeddings for users, words, and documents. We used feature
   information sharing to incorporate the correlation between the five
   personality traits into personality recognition to perfect the
   personality GCN. Our experimental results on two public and
   authoritative benchmark datasets show that the general personality GCN
   without any external word embeddings or knowledge is superior to the
   state-of-the-art methods for personality recognition. The personality
   GCN method is efficient on small datasets, and the average F1-score and
   accuracy of personality recognition are improved by up to approximately
   3.6% and 2.4-2.57%, respectively.

AB The widespread application of surfactants and their subsequent discharge
   in the receiving water bodies is a very common issue in developing
   countries. In the present investigation, a composite of graphitic carbon
   nitride (GCN) and TiO2 was used as a photo-electro-catalyst in a
   microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based hybrid system for bio-electricity
   production and simultaneous pollutant removal (organic matter and sodium
   dodecyl sulphate, SDS). The GCN: TiO2 composite with a ratio of 70:30
   (by wt. %) revealed a better electrochemical response; thus, it was used
   as a photo- electro- catalyst in MFC. Additionally, the photochemical
   characterization indicated a decrease in the band gap and charge
   recombination of GCN-TiO2 composite compared to standalone TiO2, which
   indicated a conducive effect of GCN addition. Further, on the actual use
   as a photoelectro-catalyst, the GCN-TiO2 catalysed MFC attained 58.2 +/-
   9.6% and 86.5 +/- 7.1% of COD and SDS removal; while simultaneously
   harvesting a maximum power density of 1.07 W m(-3), which was higher
   than standalone TiO2- catalysed MFC. The follow-up treatment in the
   charcoal bio-filter and photo-cathodic chamber of the hybrid system
   further improved the overall COD and SDS removal efficiency to 92.1 +/-
   2.7 and 95.6 +/- 1.5%, respectively. The electro-catalytic performance
   of the GCN-TiO2 can be attributed to the presence of nitrogen-active
   species in the composite. The results of this investigation demonstrated
   a potential MFC-based hybrid system for the simultaneous secondary and
   tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater. Consequently, the outcome of
   this investigation indicates an innovative research direction in the
   field of photoelectro-catalyst, which can fit into the role of a
   photo-catalyst as well as an electro-catalyst.

AB Introduction: Graph-based representations are becoming more common in
   the medical domain, where each node defines a patient, and the edges
   signify associations between patients, relating individuals with disease
   and symptoms in a node classification task. In this study, a Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCN) model was utilized to capture differences
   in neurocognitive, genetic, and brain atrophy patterns that can predict
   cognitive status, ranging from Normal Cognition (NC) to Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), on the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Elucidating model
   predictions is vital in medical applications to promote clinical
   adoption and establish physician trust. Therefore, we introduce a
   decomposition-based explanation method for individual patient
   classification.
   Methods: Our method involves analyzing the output variations resulting
   from decomposing input values, which allows us to determine the degree
   of impact on the prediction. Through this process, we gain insight into
   how each feature from various modalities, both at the individual and
   group levels, contributes to the diagnostic result. Given that graph
   data contains critical information in edges, we studied relational data
   by silencing all the edges of a particular class, thereby obtaining
   explanations at the neighborhood level.
   Results: Our functional evaluation showed that the explanations remain
   stable with minor changes in input values, specifically for edge weights
   exceeding 0.80. Additionally, our comparative analysis against SHAP
   values yielded comparable results with significantly reduced
   computational time. To further validate the model's explanations, we
   conducted a survey study with 11 domain experts. The majority (71%) of
   the responses confirmed the correctness of the explanations, with a
   rating of above six on a 10-point scale for the understandability of the
   explanations.
   Discussion: Strategies to overcome perceived limitations, such as the
   GCN's overreliance on demographic information, were discussed to
   facilitate future adoption into clinical practice and gain clinicians'
   trust as a diagnostic decision support system.

AB We present a computational methodology for the screening of a chemical
   space of 10(25) substituted norbornadiene molecules for promising
   kinetically stable molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage systems
   with high energy densities that absorb in the visible part of the solar
   spectrum. We use semiempirical tight-binding methods to construct a
   dataset of nearly 34 000 molecules and train graph convolutional
   networks to predict energy densities, kinetic stability, and absorption
   spectra and then use the models together with a genetic algorithm to
   search the chemical space for promising MOST energy storage systems. We
   identify 15 kinetically stable molecules, five of which have energy
   densities greater than 0.45 MJ/kg, and the main conclusion of this study
   is that the largest energy density that can be obtained for a single
   norbornadiene moiety with the substituents considered here, while
   maintaining a long half-life and absorption in the visible spectrum, is
   around 0.55 MJ/kg.

AB Graph convolutional neural networks have aroused more and more
   attentions on account of the ability to handle the graph-structured data
   defined on irregular or non-Euclidean domains. Different from the data
   defined on regular grids, each node in the graph-structured data has
   different number of neighbors, and the interactions and correlations
   between nodes vary at different locations, resulting in complex graph
   structure. However, the existing graph convolutional neural networks
   generally pay little attention to exploiting the graph structure
   information. Moreover, most existing graph convolutional neural networks
   employ the weight sharing strategy which lies on the statistical
   assumption of stationarity. This assumption is not always verified on
   the graph-structured data. To address these issues, we propose a method
   that learns Graph Structure via graph Convolutional Networks (GSCN),
   which introduces the graph structure parameters measuring the
   correlation degrees of adjacent nodes. The graph structure parameters
   are constantly modified the graph structure during the training phase
   and will help the filters of the proposed method to focus on the
   relevant nodes in each neighborhood. Meanwhile by combining the graph
   structure parameters and kernel weights, our method, which relaxes the
   restriction of weight sharing, is better to handle the graph-structured
   data of non-stationarity. In addition, the non-linear activation
   function ReLU and the sparse constraint are employed on the graph
   structure parameters to promote GSCN to focus on the important links and
   filter out the insignificant links in each neighborhood. Experiments on
   various tasks, including text categorization, molecular activity
   detection, traffic forecasting and skeleton-based action recognition,
   illustrate the validity of our method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The primary goal of aspect-based sentiment analysis is to identify
   sentiment polarity concerning the given aspect in a sentence. Recent
   investigations have demonstrated the superior performance of graph
   convolutional neural network (GCN) on dependency parsing tree. However,
   these GCN-based models fail to take the given aspect into account when
   calculating the hidden node representation vector, as well as lack
   exploration of contextual commonsense knowledge. On the contrary, the
   gating mechanism enables the interaction of the context and the given
   aspect to enhance the impact of the given aspect on the context.
   Nevertheless, such interactions are frequently inadequate resulting in
   insufficient extraction of sentiment information. This paper proposes a
   dualgated graph convolutional network via contextual affective knowledge
   (DGGCN) to address these issues. The core idea is to incorporate GCN
   into the gating mechanism to enhance GCN to fully aggregate node
   information while strengthening the concentration on the given aspect.
   Simultaneously, the incorporation of contextual affective knowledge into
   graph networks can refine the perception of affective features.
   Experimental findings on five benchmark datasets reveal that our
   proposed DGGCN surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has attracted wide
   attention on the wetland classification with limited samples. However,
   traditional approaches of superpixel generation rely on artificial
   experience and the spatial information is ignored during the
   construction of graph structure, which limits the classification
   performance. To address these problems, a feature-guided dynamic graph
   convolutional network (FG-DGCN) is proposed for wetland classification.
   First, a learnable superpixel generation module is proposed to generate
   adaptive superpixel boundaries, which composed of a pixel-wise feature
   enhancement block and a superpixel generation block. The former is
   utilized to improve the discrimination of features and the latter is
   applied to adjust the representation of superpixels by training. Second,
   a feature-guided adjacency matrix update mechanism is designed to
   dynamically capture and fuse the spectral and spatial correlations of
   graph nodes, promoting the aggregation of neighborhood information.
   Finally, the features are differentially projected back to the pixel
   space for wetland classification. Experiments on three wetland datasets
   demonstrate the superiority of FG-DGCN over state-of-the-art methods.

AB In the recent years, the emotion recognition task has attracted a lot of
   attention in the field of human- computer interaction. Most existing
   research typically uses aural-visual analysis, which has been an
   effective approach to capturing emotional features. However,
   aural-visual signals are difficult to notice, in comparison to other
   human representations such as gait in remote situations. Recently, human
   gait can be effectively recognized in more complex backgrounds because
   of the advancement of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). According to
   the anatomy of the human body, central torso joints play a key role in
   GCNs-based human gait recognition systems, instead of the body's
   marginal limb joints. As a result, there is a major issue of receptive
   field imbalance. In this study, we propose a method for perceiv-ing
   emotions based on the human gait skeleton. We present a multi-head
   pseudo nodes strategy to alle-viate the receptive field imbalance
   problem and capture the non-local dependencies among different joints.
   The strategy employs a series of extra nodes that link to all physical
   human body joints and obtain global information from different feature
   spaces. The results of the experiments on a public emotion-gait dataset
   demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing skeleton-based
   methods. Further, to verify the effectiveness of our method, we use
   publicly available human action recognition datasets. Our results show
   that our method significantly improves performance in comparison to
   other baseline methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting low cognitive scores at an early stage is important for
   delaying the progress of dementia. Investigations of early-stage
   detection have employed automatic assessment using dual-task (i.e.,
   performing two different tasks simultaneously). However, current
   approaches to dual-task-based detection are based on either simple
   features or limited motion information, which degrades the detection
   accuracy. To address this problem, we proposed a framework that uses
   graph convolutional networks to extract spatio-temporal features from
   dual-task performance data. Moreover, to make the proposed method robust
   against data imbalance, we devised a loss function that directly
   optimizes the summation of the sensitivity and specificity of the
   detection of low cognitive scores (i.e., score≤ 23 or score≤ 27). Our
   evaluation is based on 171 subjects from 6 different senior citizens'
   facilities. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed
   algorithm considerably outperforms the previous standard with respect to
   both the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of low cognitive
   scores.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition is a widely used task in action
   related research because of its clear features and the invariance of
   human appearances and illumination. Furthermore, it can also effectively
   improve the robustness of the action recognition. Graph convolutional
   networks have been implemented on those skeletal data to recognize
   actions. Recent studies have shown that the graph convolutional neural
   network works well in the action recognition task using spatial and
   temporal features of skeleton data. The prevalent methods to extract the
   spatial and temporal features purely rely on a deep network to learn
   from primitive 3D position. In this paper, we propose a novel action
   recognition method applying high-order spatial and temporal features
   from skeleton data, such as velocity features, acceleration features,
   and relative distance between 3D joints. Meanwhile, a method of
   multi-stream feature fusion is adopted to fuse these high-order features
   we proposed. Extensive experiments on Two large and challenging
   datasets, NTU-RGBD and NTU-RGBD-120, indicate that our model achieves
   the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and network embedding are the two
   main categories of popular methods for Semi-Supervised Node
   Classification (SSNC) in social network. However, the former is commonly
   oriented to attributed networks with efficient auxiliary information in
   nodes. The latter is usually not geared towards specific graph mining
   tasks. Therefore, these methods often perform poorly for specific tasks
   in non-attributed networks. To solve the above problems, in this paper,
   we propose a novel semi-supervised Node Classification method with
   Ladder Neural Networks named NCLNN for non-attributed network. We first
   preprocess the graph for capturing the structural information. Then we
   present and learn a deep ladder neural network for SSNC. Our trained
   ladder neural networks could combine supervised learning with
   unsupervised learning in deep neural networks via simultaneously
   minimizing the sum of supervised and unsupervised loss functions.
   Extensive experiments on three real-world network datasets demonstrate
   that the proposed NCLNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art
   methods on SSNC task.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved much success in
   various graph learning tasks. However, as the number of layers
   increases, the smoothing of GCNs will over-mix the neighbors'
   information, leading output towards space with low expressivity. It is
   known as the over-smoothing issue. Although several works have refined
   deep GCNs by optimizing network structure, receptive field, and
   topology, the over-smoothing issue cannot be completely avoided. In this
   paper, we propose a recurrent neural network framework for learning
   graph representation while avoiding over-smoothing effectively, which is
   the tree-structure aggregation and optimization framework named Treeago.
   Treeago firstly transforms the irregularly distributed graph into
   sequential trees. Then, Treeago adopts Tree-LSTM with attention to
   aggregate important neighbors' feature information to the graph
   representation. Tree-LSTM with attention can prevent the mixing of noise
   neighbors' information to avoid the over-smoothing issue. Finally,
   Treeago uses an edge pruning optimization framework based on
   reinforcement learning to enhance the model's performance further.
   Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that Treeago
   effectively avoids over-smoothing and yields state-of-the-art results.

AB Graph convolutional network is now an effective tool to deal with
   non-Euclidean data, such as social behavior analysis, molecular
   structure analysis, and skeleton-based action recognition. Graph
   convolutional kernel is one of the most significant factors in graph
   convolutional networks to extract nodes' feature, and some variants of
   it have achieved highly satisfactory performance theoretically and
   experimentally. However, there was limited research about how exactly
   different graph structures influence the performance of these kernels.
   Some existing methods used an adaptive convolutional kernel to deal with
   a given graph structure, which still not explore the internal reasons.
   In this paper, we start from theoretical analysis of the spectral graph
   and study the properties of existing graph convolutional kernels,
   revealing the selfsmoothing phenomenon and its effect in specific
   structured graphs. After that, we propose the Poisson kernel that can
   avoid self-smoothing without training any adaptive kernel. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our Poisson kernel not only works well on the
   benchmark datasets where state-of-the-art methods work fine, but also is
   evidently superior to them in synthetic datasets. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images
   has achieved good results due to the excellent fitting ability of neural
   networks with a large number of training samples. However, the
   performance of most convolutional neural networks (CNNs) degrades
   dramatically when only a few labeled training samples are available. As
   one well-known class of semi-supervised learning methods, graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) have gained much attention recently to
   address the classification problem with only a few labeled samples. As
   the number of layers grows in the network, the parameters dramatically
   increase. It is challenging to determine an optimal architecture
   manually. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture search method
   based GCN (ASGCN) for the classification of PolSAR images. We construct
   a novel graph whose nodes combines both the physical features and
   spatial relations between pixels or samples to represent the image. Then
   we build a new searching space whose components are empirically selected
   from some graph neural networks for architecture search and develop the
   differentiable architecture search method to construction our ASGCN.
   Moreover, to address the training of large-scale images, we present a
   new weighted mini-batch algorithm to reduce the computing memory
   consumption and ensure the balance of sample distribution, and also
   analyze and compare with other similar training strategies. Experiments
   on several real-world PolSAR datasets show that our method has improved
   the overall accuracy as much as 3.76% than state-of-the-art methods.

AB We propose a novel framework for computing descriptors for
   characterizing points on three-dimensional surfaces. First, we present a
   new non-learned feature that uses graph wavelets to decompose the
   Dirichlet energy on a surface. We call this new feature Wavelet Energy
   Decomposition Signature (WEDS). Second, we propose a new Multiscale
   Graph Convolutional Network (MGCN) to transform a non-learned feature to
   a more discriminative descriptor. Our results show that the new
   descriptor WEDS is more discriminative than the current state-of-the-art
   non-learned descriptors and that the combination of WEDS and MGCN is
   better than the state-of-the-art learned descriptors. An important
   design criterion for our descriptor is the robustness to different
   surface discretizations including triangulations with varying numbers of
   vertices. Our results demonstrate that previous graph convolutional
   networks significantly overlit to a particular resolution or even a
   particular triangulation, but MGCN generalizes well to different surface
   discretizations. In addition, MGCN is compatible with previous
   descriptors and it can also be used to improve the performance of other
   descriptors, such as the heat kernel signature, the wave kernel
   signature, or the local point signature.

AB Text classification is an important task in natural language processing,
   and most of the recent approaches employ neural networks to learn and
   classify the texts. RNN and CNN based models, which are widely used for
   solving the task, involve reading and processing the text in a
   sequential manner. This creates inefficiency in learning dependencies
   between far-apart words. On the contrary, Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) architecture is capable of processing more complex
   graph-structured data, thus having potential to recognize and learn from
   complex linguistic structures.In the present work, we transform text
   sequences into graphs by assigning each word in the text as a node and
   representing the relationship between words as edges. We then propose a
   method for solving text classification that uses recent GCN
   architectures to take the transformed text-graph as input, learn hidden
   representations, and output a single hidden representation for
   classification. In our experiments, our proposed model outperformed RNN
   and CNN based models with regards to various text classification tasks.

   있다. 본 논문에서는 문서의 비순차적인 관계를 그래프로 담아내어 더욱 효과적으로 파악하고 분류하는 인공신경망 모델을 제안한다.

AB This work investigates proactive edge caching for device-to-device
   (D2D)-assisted wireless networks, where user equipment (UE) can be
   selected as caching nodes to assist content delivery to reduce the
   content transmission latency. In doing so, there are two challenges: 1)
   how to precisely get the user's preference to cache the proper contents
   at UEs and 2) how to replace the contents cached at UEs when there are
   new popular contents emerging. To address these, we develop a user
   preference learning-based proactive edge caching (UPL-PEC) strategy. In
   the strategy, we first propose a novel context and social-aware user
   preference learning method to precisely predict user's dynamic
   preferences by jointly exploiting the context correlation among
   different contents, the influence of social relationships and the
   time-sequential patterns of user's content requests. Specifically, the
   bidirectional long short-term memory networks are adopted to capture the
   time-sequential patterns of the user's content requests. And, the graph
   convolutional networks are developed to capture the high-order
   similarity representation among different contents from the constructed
   content graph. To learn the social influence representation, an
   attention mechanism is designed to generate the social influence weights
   to users with different social relationship. Based on the learned user
   preference, a proactive edge caching architecture is proposed to
   integrate the offline caching content placement and the online caching
   content replacement policy to continuously cache the popular contents at
   UEs. Simulation results show that the proposed UPL-PEC strategy
   outperforms the existing similar caching strategies at about 3.13%-4.62%
   in terms of the average content transmission latency.

AB The results of aerial scene classification can provide valuable
   information for urban planning and land monitoring. In this specific
   field, there are always a number of object-level semantic classes in big
   remote-sensing pictures. Complex label-space makes it hard to detect all
   the targets and perceive corresponding semantics in the typical scene,
   thereby weakening the sensing ability. Even worse, the preparation of a
   labeled dataset for the training of deep networks is more difficult due
   to multiple labels. In order to mine object-level visual features and
   make good use of label dependency, we propose a novel framework in this
   article, namely a Cross-Modal Representation Learning and Label Graph
   Mining-based Residual Multi-Attentional CNN-LSTM framework (CM-GM
   framework). In this framework, a residual multi-attentional
   convolutional neural network is developed to extract object-level image
   features. Moreover, semantic labels are embedded by language model and
   then form a label graph which can be further mapped by advanced graph
   convolutional networks (GCN). With these cross-modal feature
   representations (image, graph and text), object-level visual features
   will be enhanced and aligned to GCN-based label embeddings. After that,
   aligned visual signals are fed into a bi-LSTM subnetwork according to
   the built label graph. The CM-GM framework is able to map both visual
   features and graph-based label representations into a correlated space
   appropriately, using label dependency efficiently, thus improving the
   LSTM predictor's ability. Experimental results show that the proposed
   CM-GM framework is able to achieve higher accuracy on many multi-label
   benchmark datasets in remote sensing field.

AB Spatial information regarding the arrangement of land cover objects
   plays an important role in distinguishing the land use types at land
   parcel or local neighborhood levels. This study investigates the use of
   graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in order to characterize spatial
   arrangement features for land use classification from high resolution
   remote sensing images, with particular interest in comparing land use
   classifications between different graph-based methods and between
   different remote sensing images. We examine three kinds of graph-based
   methods, i.e., feature engineering, graph kernels, and GCNs. Based upon
   the extracted arrangement features and features regarding the spatial
   composition of land cover objects, we formulated ten land use
   classifications. We tested those on two different remote sensing images,
   which were acquired from GaoFen-2 (with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m)
   and ZiYuan-3 (of 2.5 m) satellites in 2020 on Fuzhou City, China. Our
   results showed that land use classifications that are based on the
   arrangement features derived from GCNs achieved the highest
   classification accuracy than using graph kernels and handcrafted graph
   features for both images. We also found that the contribution to
   separating land use types by arrangement features varies between
   GaoFen-2 and ZiYuan-3 images, due to the difference in the spatial
   resolution. This study offers a set of approaches for effectively
   mapping land use types from (very) high resolution satellite images.

   Graph convolutional networks (GCN) model (NNGCN) was put forward to

   NN. The concept of link index was introduced into the NNGCN model. It is
   combined with the important information between event nodes. The
   information includes the similarity of events and link probability.
   Compared with the original unoptimized model, the improved model
   increased the classification accuracy of terrorist attacks. Because the
   model uses the node's feature information and the link relationship of
   graph structure, it can also warn the sudden terrorist attacks
   effectively.

AB Providing timely rescue when a fall occurs can greatly reduce fall
   mortality for older people. With the growing number of single-resided
   elders, real-time smart fall incident detection has become a new
   research hotspot. Accuracy, computational complexity and real-time
   response are key issues to be solved in this topic. A fall detection
   model that combines an improved Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional
   Network (ST-GCN) with the BlazePose algorithm is proposed in this paper.
   The computational speed is improved by removing four redundant layers
   from the ST-GCN network. Meanwhile, an attention mechanism focussing on
   the key joints involved in the falling action and their correlation is
   applied in the model, which introduces an Effective SE Block (ESE Block)
   to the residual structure of ST-GCN. It is achieved by fusing the
   original features with channel attention weights obtained by global
   average pooling and fully connected operations for the joint features.
   The BlazePose algorithm of the mediapipe framework is used to recognise
   human targets and locate the spatial coordinates of specific joints.
   Then the spatiotemporal graph features of the human body are extracted
   by the improved ST-GCN from the temporal and spatial displacements of 30
   consecutive frames. Furthermore, fall behaviour is judged by the action
   type defined by the spatiotemporal graph. The accuracy of the proposed
   model for public datasets, such as Le2i Fall, Multicam Fall and UR Fall,
   is 99.29%, 99.22% and 98.64% respectively, which are higher than the
   Alphapose + ST-GCN model by 9.04%, 20% and 25.2%. Such accuracy is even
   better than the existing best algorithms by 0.89%, 0.92% and 1.04%. When
   running on the i5-10200H CPU and the Jetson Nano edge computing device,
   the Alphapose + ST-GCN model achieves frame rates of 11.42fps and
   1.5fps, whilst the frame rates of this paper are up to 24.5fps and
   9.37fps. The experimental results fully show that based on BlazePose
   with the improved ST-GCN makes the fall detection model higher accuracy,
   faster speed, real-time performance and high compatibility with the
   Jetson Nano edge computing device.

AB Aspect-level sentiment analysis (ALSA) is the process of collecting,
   processing, analyzing, inferring, and synthesizing subjective sentiments
   of entities contained in texts at the aspect level. The development of
   social networks has been driven by the on-going appearance of vast
   numbers of short documents, such as those in which opinions are
   expressed and comments are made. The text in these documents reflects
   users' emotions related to entities. The ALSA of these short texts plays
   an important role in solving various problems in life. Particularly in
   e-commerce, manufacturers can use sentiment analysis to determine users'
   orientations, adapt their products to perfection, identify potential
   users, and pinpoint users that influence other users. Therefore,
   improving the performance of ALSA methods has recently attracted the
   interest of researchers. Currently, four main types of ALSA methods are
   available: knowledge-based, machine learning-based, hybrid-based, and
   most recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based. This study is
   the first survey to focus on reviewing the proposed methods for ALSA
   using GCN methods. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy to divide
   GCN-based ALSA models into three categories based on the types of
   knowledge extraction. We present and compare GCN-based ALSA methods
   following our taxonomy comprehensively. Common benchmark datasets and
   text representations that are often used in GCN-based methods are also
   discussed. In addition, we discuss five challenges and suggest seven
   future research directions for GCN-based ALSA methods. The findings of
   our survey are expected to provide the necessary guidelines for
   beginners, practitioners, and new researchers to improve the performance
   of ALSA methods.

AB To combat cybercrimes and maintain financial security for the blockchain
   ecosystem", know your customer" (KYC) is an essential and also
   challenging process due to the pseudonymity nature of blockchain
   technology. To unlock the potential of KYC on blockchain-based platforms
   like Ethereum, account labeling is a powerful means which can
   de-anonymize addresses by mining public transaction records. Existing
   studies on account labeling are mainly conducted via machine learning
   (ML) methods fed with hand-crafted features or graph neural networks
   based on the modeled transaction network. However, ML approaches based
   on hand-crafted features ignore the global interaction information
   between accounts, making it easy for criminals to evade detection.
   Moreover, the performance of traditional GCN methods when applied to
   Ethereum transaction network encounters limitations due to label
   sparsity, network heterophily, and large network size of the transaction
   network. In this article, we first analyze Ethereum accounts involved in
   typical businesses, in terms of both account and topological features.
   Then based on the analytical results, we propose a novel GCN method
   named know-your-customer graph convolutional network (KYC-GCN) which
   contains two key designs: 1) multihop aggregators and importance-based
   sampling are designed to tackle the dilemma between accuracy and
   efficiency. 2) GCN architecture is improved to explicitly capture local
   and more global information. Experimental results on a realistic
   Ethereum dataset show that the proposed KYC-GCN (90.2% accuracy, 86.2%
   Marco-F1) achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, and
   results on six benchmarks demonstrate that it yields great performance
   under homophily and heterophily.

AB Graph convolutional neural network (GCN) has drawn increasing attention
   and attained good perfor-mance in various computer vision tasks,
   however, there is a lack of a clear interpretation of GCN's inner
   mechanism. For standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), class
   activation mapping (CAM) meth-ods are commonly used to visualize the
   connection between CNN's decision and image region by gener-ating a
   heatmap. Nonetheless, such heatmap usually exhibits semantic-chaos when
   these CAMs are applied to GCN directly. In this paper, we proposed a
   novel visualization method particularly applicable to GCN, Vertex
   Semantic Class Activation Mapping (VS-CAM). VS-CAM includes two
   independent pipeli-nes to produce a set of semantic-probe maps and a
   semantic-base map, respectively. Semantic-probe maps are used to detect
   the semantic information from the semantic-base map to aggregate a
   semantic-aware heatmap. Qualitative results show that VS-CAM can obtain
   heatmaps where the high-lighted regions match the objects much more
   precisely than CNN-based CAM. The quantitative evalua-tion further
   demonstrates the superiority of VS-CAM.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an effective tool for feature
   clustering. However, in the text classification task, the traditional
   TextGCN (GCN for Text Classification) ignores the context word order of
   the text. In addition, TextGCN constructs the text graph only according
   to the context relationship, so it is difficult for the word nodes to
   learn an effective semantic representation. Based on this, this paper
   proposes a text classification method that combines Transformer and GCN.
   To improve the semantic accuracy of word node features, we add a part of
   speech (POS) to the word-document graph and build edges between words
   based on POS. In the layer-to-layer of GCN, the Transformer is used to
   extract the contextual and sequential information of the text. We
   conducted the experiment on five representative datasets. The results
   show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of text
   classification and is better than the comparison method.

AB Predicting terrorism risk is crucial for formulating detailed
   counter-strategies. However, this task is challenging mainly because the
   risk of the concerned potential victim is not isolated. Terrorism risk
   has a spatiotemporal interprovincial contagious characteristic. The risk
   diffusion mechanism comes from three possibilities: cross-provincial
   terrorist attacks, internal and external echoes, and internal
   self-excitation. This study proposed a novel spatiotemporal graph
   convolutional network (STGCN)-based extension method to capture the
   complex and multidimensional non-Euclidean relationships between
   different provinces and forecast the daily risks. Specifically, three
   graph structures were constructed to represent the contagious process
   between provinces: the distance graph, the province-level root cause
   similarity graph, and the self-excited graph. The long short-term memory
   and self-attention layers were extended to STGCN for capturing
   context-dependent temporal characters. At the same time, the
   one-dimensional convolutional neural network kernel with the gated
   linear unit inside the classical STGCN can model single-node-dependent
   temporal features, and the spectral graph convolution modules can
   capture spatial features. The experimental results on Afghanistan
   terrorist attack data from 2005 to 2020 demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed extended STGCN method compared to other machine learning
   prediction models. Furthermore, the results illustrate the crucial of
   capturing comprehensive spatiotemporal correlation characters among
   provinces. Based on this, this article provides counter-terrorism
   management insights on addressing the long-term root causes of terrorism
   risk and performing short-term situational prevention.

AB Computing the similarity between graphs is a longstanding and
   challenging problem with many real-world applications. Recent years have
   witnessed a rapid increase in neural-network-based methods, which
   project graphs into embedding space and devise end-to-end frameworks to
   learn to estimate graph similarity. Nevertheless, these solutions
   usually design complicated networks to capture the fine-grained
   interactions between graphs, and hence have low efficiency.
   Additionally, they rely on labeled data for training the neural networks
   and overlook the useful information hidden in the graphs themselves. To
   address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we put forward a
   contrastive neural graph similarity learning framework, Conga.
   Specifically, we utilize vanilla graph convolutional networks to
   generate the graph representations and capture the cross-graph
   interactions via a simple multilayer perceptron. We further devise an
   unsupervised contrastive loss to discriminate the graph embeddings and
   guide the training process by learning more expressive entity
   representations. Extensive experiment results on public datasets
   validate that our proposal has more robust performance and higher
   efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Network Slice placement with the problem of allocation of resources from
   a virtualized substrate network is an optimization problem which can be
   formulated as a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
   problem. However, to cope with the complexity of such a continuous task
   and seeking for optimality and automation, the use of Machine Learning
   (ML) techniques appear as a promising approach. We introduce a hybrid
   placement solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and a
   dedicated optimization heuristic based on the "Power of Two Choices"
   principle. The DRL algorithm uses the so-called Asynchronous Advantage
   Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm for fast learning, and Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCN) to automate feature extraction from the physical
   substrate network. The proposed Heuristically-Assisted DRL (HA-DRL)
   allows for the acceleration of the learning process and substantial gain
   in resource usage when compared against other state-of-the-art
   approaches, as evidenced by evaluation results.

AB In recent years, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been
   extensively applied in numerous fields, demonstrating strong
   performances. Although existing GCN-based models have extraordinary
   feature representation capabilities in spatial modeling and perform
   exceptionally well in skeleton-based action recognition, they work
   poorly for fine-grained recognition. The key issue involves tiny
   distinctions between multiple classes. To address this issue, we propose
   a novel module named the topology-embedded temporal attention module
   (TE-TAM). Through embedding the temporal-different topology modeled with
   local area skeleton points in spatial and temporal dimensions, the
   TE-TAM achieves dynamical attention learning for the temporal dimensions
   of distinct data samples, to capture minor differences among
   intra-frames and inter-frames, making the characteristics more
   discriminating, and increasing the distances between various classes. To
   verify the validity of the proposed module, we inserted the module into
   the GCN-based models and tested them on FSD-30. Experimental results
   show that the GCN-based models with TE-TAMs outperformed the property of
   pred GCN-based models.

AB The pressure prediction technology whereby represents the rock pressure

   that machine learning is used to accurate prediction of underground
   pressure changes. However, the existing research which based on the
   classical machine learning rarely considers the cause between inducement
   of underground pressure and the underground pressure change. In this
   paper, we propose a novel Reinforced and Causal Graph Neural Network,
   namely RC-GNN, for the prediction task, to overcome the shortage of
   causal logic. First, we build a causal graph by considering internal
   relations between inducement and display of pressure and employ prior
   knowledge to erect the early and properties of the graph. Second, we
   construct the prediction network for underground pressure by graph
   convolutional networks and long short-term memory. Finally, we use the
   performance index of underground pressure prediction to design a
   reinforcement learning algorithm, which achieves optimization of the
   causal graph. Compared to six representative methods, experimental
   results with 18-60% increases in performance on the real prediction
   task.

AB In the case of limited energy, the waste of energy and economic loss
   caused by abnormal electricity consumption should not be underestimated
   and its detection plays an important role. However, abnormal electricity
   consumption detection also faces many challenges. On the one hand,
   labeled abnormal data are difficult to obtain. On the other hand,
   building different models for different users undoubtedly increases the
   demand for data and the burden of training. To tackle these challenges,
   in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based graph convolutional
   network with self-attention mechanism method to detect abnormal
   electricity consumption. With the help of transfer learning, we firstly
   pre-train the source domain network using the sufficient data. Then, a
   small amount of data in the target domain is utilized to fine-tune the
   pre-training model to get the final detection model. This can not only
   effectively alleviate the problem of insufficient data, but also reduce
   the training burden caused by building different models for different
   users. In addition, to improve the effect of feature extraction and
   enhance the performance of the network, we employ the self-attention
   mechanism to enhance the network's attention to different data
   information. Finally, we adopt the graph convolutional networks to
   discover the relationships of electricity consumption data among
   different moments and to classify the electricity consumption data. We
   have done detailed experiments to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed method, and experimental results show that the proposed method
   is effective and robust. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

   convolutional layers that can achieve a good performance in recognizing
   actions but with a high inference speed. The experimental results show
   that our solution, based on a combination of graph convolutional
   networks (GCN) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN), is a suitable
   approach that reaches the proposed goal. In addition to the neural
   network model, we design a pipeline that contains two stages for
   obtaining relevant geometric features, data augmentation and data
   preprocessing, also contributing to an increased performance.

AB Weather recognition is a significant technique for many potential
   computer vision applications in our daily lives. Generally, most
   existing works treat weather recognition as a single-label
   classification task, which cannot describe the weather conditions
   comprehensively due to the complex co-occurrence dependencies between
   different weather conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph
   Convolution Networks with Attention (GCN-A) model for multi-label
   weather recognition. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to
   introduce GCN into weather recognition. Specifically, we employ GCN to
   capture weather co-occurrence dependencies via a directed graph. The
   graph is built over weather labels, where each node (weather label) is
   represented by word embeddings of a weather label. Furthermore, we
   design a re-weighted mechanism to build weather correlation matrix for
   information propagation among different nodes in GCN. In addition, we
   develop a channel-wise attention module to extract informative semantic
   features of weather for effective model training. Compared with the
   state-of-the-art methods, experiment results on two widely used
   benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed GCN-A model achieves
   promising performance.

AB With the continuous development of technology and networks, real-life
   interactions are gradually being abstracted into social networks for
   study. Social circles are a fundamental structural feature that is
   prevalent on social networks. Thus, exploring social circle structure
   plays an important role in revealing the characteristics of complex
   social networks and provides guidance for understanding social behavior
   in real life. For example, it can aid in precision marketing,
   personalized recommendation, and knowledge dissemination within social
   circles. One of the important means of identifying social network
   circles lies on community detection algorithms. However, real-world
   social networks are often dynamic and can be studied and analyzed by
   building dynamic networks, while existing dynamic network community
   detection methods tend to ignore the global structure information and
   time-series information of nodes. To address this problem, this paper
   proposes a dynamic network community detection algorithm based on graph
   convolutional neural networks and contrastive learning, which fully
   captures the adjacent characteristics between nodes based on the
   correlation information and leverages the feature smoothing strategy to
   efficiently extract node representations of dynamic networks under
   unsupervised scenario. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first
   utilizes node correlation based aggregation strategy to compute the
   feature matrix for single time-step of the dynamic network. Then, mutual
   information maximization is implemented based on cross-entropy between
   learned local and global representations. To reduce the computational
   overhead in the optimization process, an additional LSTM module is
   further equipped for updating the parameters of graph convolutional
   networks in each time-step. Additionally, a contrastive learning based
   network smoothing strategy is designed to minimize the feature
   differences between neighboring nodes. Comparative experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance
   on both synthetic and real networks.

AB Learning vector embeddings of users and items is the core of modern
   recommender systems. Recently the collaborative filtering recommender
   systems based on graph convolutional networks, which integrates the
   bipartite graph of user-item interaction into the embedding process, has
   achieved significant success. However, such feature as item-item
   interaction sequence is neglected in the bipartite graph, which limits
   the ability to model sequential orders for embedding of items. In this
   work, we propose a novel item-item interaction sequential graph to
   globally aggregate the hidden interactions sequence among all items. It
   is derived from the order of all user-item interactions and can give a
   supplement for user-item interaction modeling in CF. We also propose an
   item enhanced graph collaborative network (IEGCN) to mix item-item
   sequences with user-item interactions for collaborative filtering. We
   performed experiments on three open datasets, and IEGCN shows
   substantial improvements in recall and normalized discounted cumulative
   gain when compared with existing mainstream models. Further analysis
   verifies the importance of item-item sequence graph to improve the
   recommendation effect.

AB The halogen, bromine (Br) doped layered graphitic carbon nitride (gCN)
   nanosheets are constructed for a novel electrochemical detection of
   dopamine (DA). The Br is successfully immobilized in the gCN host
   lattice, in which Br provides an N-vacancy for -C-N bonding to improve
   electron transfer and enhance its electrocatalytic properties. The
   prepared nanosheets are studied by various analytical analyses and the
   electrochemical behavior of the designed electrode is studied using
   cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Br-gCN decorated screen-printed carbon
   electrode (SPCE) has superior electrochemical activity and is stable
   during exposure to varied pH, however, exhibited better catalytic
   activity at pH 7. The Br-gCN/SPEC electrodes and their high
   electrocatalytic performance are used for the detection of dopamine with
   a lower limit of detection (LoD) of 5 nM concentration. The Br-gCN
   decorated electrodes exhibited satisfactory results for cyclic stability
   (up to 100th cycle), repeatability (up to 6 cycles), reproducibility of
   similarly constructed 6 electrodes, and their electrochemical
   performance. Furthermore, the fabricated sensor also exhibited a better
   recovery (>80%) for real-time urine sample analyses.

AB In this paper, we propose a dynamic graph modeling approach to learn
   spatial-temporal representations for video summarization. Most existing
   video summarization methods extract image-level features with ImageNet
   pre-trained deep models. Differently, our method exploits object-level
   and relation-level information to capture spatial-temporal dependencies.
   Specifically, our method builds spatial graphs on the detected object
   proposals. Then, we construct a temporal graph by using the aggregated
   representations of spatial graphs. Afterward, we perform relational
   reasoning over spatial and temporal graphs with graph convolutional
   networks and extract spatial-temporal representations for importance
   score prediction and key shot selection. To eliminate relation clutters
   caused by densely connected nodes, we further design a self-attention
   edge pooling module, which disregards meaningless relations of graphs.
   We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, including
   the SumMe and TVSum datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed method achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art
   video summarization methods.

AB Human video prediction is still a challenging problem due to the
   uncertainty of future actions and complexity of frame details. Recent
   methods tackle this problem in two steps: firstly to forecast future
   human poses from the initial ones, and then to generate realistic frames
   conditioned on predicted poses. Following this framework, we propose a
   novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based pose predictor to
   comprehensively model human body joints and forcast their positions
   holistically, and also a stacked generative model with a temporal
   discriminator to iteratively refine the quality of the generated videos.
   The GCN based pose predictor fully considers the relationships among
   body joints and produces more plausible pose predictions. With the
   guidance of predicted poses, a temporal discriminator encodes temporal
   information into future frame generation to achieve high-quality
   results. Furthermore, stacked residual refinement generators make the
   results more realistic. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed method produces better predictions than
   state-of-the-arts and achieves up to 15% improvement in PSNR.

AB An important task in the early stage of drug discovery is the
   identification of mutagenic compounds. Mutagenicity prediction models
   that can interpret relationships between toxicological endpoints and
   compound structures are especially favorable. In this research, we used
   an advanced graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture to
   identify the molecular representation and develop predictive models
   based on these representations. The predictive model based on features
   extracted by GCNNs can not only predict the mutagenicity of compounds
   but also identify the structure alerts in compounds. In fivefold
   cross-validation and external validation, the highest area under the
   curve was 0.8782 and 0.8382, respectively; the highest accuracy (Q) was
   80.98% and 76.63%, respectively; the highest sensitivity was 83.27% and
   78.92%, respectively; and the highest specificity was 78.83% and 76.32%,
   respectively. Additionally, our model also identified some toxicophores,
   such as aromatic nitro, three-membered heterocycles, quinones, and
   nitrogen and sulfur mustard. These results indicate that GCNNs could
   learn the features of mutagens effectively. In summary, we developed a
   mutagenicity classification model with high predictive performance and
   interpretability based on a data-driven molecular representation trained
   through GCNNs.

AB As a deep learning method, graph convolution network (GCN) has the
   advantage of dealing with non-Euclidean domain problems and is
   constantly applied in the research of computer-aided diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). In graph-based methods for AD diagnosis, nodes
   can represent potential subjects with a set of vectors, and edges
   combine the interaction and similarity between subjects. However, for
   the three-dimensional neuroimage like structural Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (sMRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), due to the
   nonsequential of ROI (Region of Interest) features (compared with
   four-dimensional neuroimage), which makes the graph-based analysis
   approach more difficult. In this study, we obtained individual features
   by constructing brain network via health group indirectly, and then
   constructed a population-based GCN framework by expressing the subject
   population as adjacency matrix in graph to achieve the diagnosis of AD.
   The nodes in graph are associated with individual features, and edges
   are weighted by combining the phenotypic information, we further discuss
   the influence of phenotypic information on the classification
   performance of GCN. Compared with acquiring the ROI features of the
   brain regions as the input features of GCN, our proposed method
   remarkably improved the prediction accuracy based on both sMRI and PET
   images by about 5 to 10 percentage. Through our testing and experimental
   analysis on the public ADNI dataset, our method achieved improved
   performance for AD diagnosis and mild cognitive impairment conversion
   prediction tasks. Our proposed method also provides technical support
   for AD diagnosis using GCN method based on three-dimensional brain
   images.

AB Artificial intelligence for graph-structured data has achieved
   remarkable success in applications such as recommendation systems,
   social networks, drug discovery, and circuit annotation. Graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) are an effective way to learn
   representations of various graphs. The increasing size and complexity of
   graphs call for in-memory computing (IMC) accelerators for GCN to
   alleviate massive data transmission between off-chip memory and
   processing units. However, GCN implementation with IMC is challenging
   because of the large memory consumption, irregular memory access, and
   device nonidealities. Herein, a fully binarized GCN (BGCN) accelerator
   based on computational resistive random-access memory (RRAM) through
   software-hardware codesign is presented. The essential operations
   including aggregation and combination in GCN are implemented on the RRAM
   crossbar arrays with cooperation between multiply-and-accumulation and
   content-addressable memory operations. By leveraging the model
   quantization and IMC on the RRAM, the BGCN accelerator demonstrates less
   RRAM usage, high robustness to the device variations, high energy
   efficiency, and comparable classification accuracy compared to the
   current state-of-the-art GCN accelerators on both graph classification
   task using the MUTAG and PTC datasets and node classification task using
   the Cora and CiteSeer datasets. These results provide a promising
   approach for edge intelligent systems to efficiently process
   graph-structured data.
   This article presents a fully binarized graph convolutional network

AB With the increasing use of open-source libraries and secondary
   development, software projects face security vulnerabilities. Existing
   studies on source code vulnerability detection rely on natural language
   processing techniques, but they overlook the intricate dependencies in
   programming languages. To address this, we propose a framework called
   Context and Multi-Features-based Vulnerability Detection (CMFVD). CMFVD
   integrates source code graphs and textual sequences, using a novel
   slicing method called Context Slicing to capture contextual information.
   The framework combines graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and
   bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) with attention mechanisms to
   extract local semantic and syntactic information. Experimental results
   on Software Assurance Reference Datasets (SARDs) demonstrate CMFVD's
   effectiveness, achieving the highest F1-score of 0.986 and outperforming
   other models. CMFVD offers a promising approach to identifying and
   rectifying security flaws in large-scale codebases.

AB Background New drugs are costly, time-consuming, and often accompanied
   by safety concerns. With the development of deep learning,
   computer-aided drug design has become more mainstream, and convolutional
   neural networks and graph neural networks have been widely used for
   drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction.Objective The paper proposes a
   method of predicting DTA using graph convolutional networks and
   multiscale convolutional neural networks.Methods We construct drug
   molecules into graph representation vectors and learn feature
   expressions through graph attention networks and graph convolutional
   networks. A three-branch convolutional neural network learns the local
   and global features of protein sequences, and the two feature
   representations are merged into a regression module to predict the
   DTA.Results We present a novel model to predict DTA, with a 2.5%
   improvement in the consistency index and a 21% accuracy improvement in
   terms of the mean squared error on the Davis dataset compared to
   DeepDTA. Morever, our method outperformed other mainstream DTA
   prediction models namely, GANsDTA, WideDTA, GraphDTA and
   DeepAffinity.Conclusion The results showed that the use of multiscale
   convolutional neural networks was better than a single-branched
   convolutional neural network at capturing protein signatures and the use
   of graphs to express drug molecules yielded better results.

AB A novel mechanism for skeleton-based action recognition is proposed in
   this paper by enhancing and fusing diverse skeleton features from
   distinct levels. Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have been
   proven to be efficient in skeleton-based action recognition. However,
   most graph convolutional networks tend to capture and fuse
   discriminative information from different forms of data in spatial
   neighborhoods. In that case, the deeper interactions among different
   forms of data as well as the extraction of information in the temporal
   and channel dimensions are limited. To tackle the issue, we propose the
   ternary adaptive graph convolution (TAGC) module to capture
   spatiotemporal information by graph convolution. A novel skeleton
   information, called parallax information, is explored from original
   joints or bones with little computation to further improve the
   performance of action recognition. In addition, in order to make better
   use of multiple streams, multi-stream feature fusion (MSFF) is proposed
   to mine deeper-level hybrid features supplementing the original streams.
   And a graph-based ternary enhance (GTE) module is proposed to further
   refine the extracted discriminative features. Finally, the proposed
   multi-stream ternary enhanced graph convolutional network (MS-TEGCN)
   achieves the state-of-the-art results through extensive experiments on
   three challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition,
   NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics-Skeleton.

AB Face clustering groups massive unlabeled face images according to their
   underlying identities and has proven to be a valuable tool for data
   analysis. Most recent studies have utilized graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs) to explore the structural properties of faces, thereby
   effectively achieving improved clustering performance. However, these
   methods usually suffer from computational intractability for large-scale
   graphs and tend to be sensitive to some postprocessing thresholds that
   serve to purify the clustering results. To address these issues, in this
   paper, we consider each pairwise relationship between two samples as a
   learning unit and infer clustering assignments by evaluating a group of
   pairwise connections. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering
   framework, named structure-enhanced pairwise feature learning (SEPFL),
   which mixes neighborhood information to adaptively produce pairwise
   representations for cluster identification. In addition, we design a
   combined density strategy to select representative pairs, thus ensuring
   training effectiveness and inference efficiency. The extensive
   experimental results show that SEPFL achieves better performance than
   other advanced face clustering techniques.

AB Interactions between drugs can occur when two or more drugs are used for
   the same patient. This may result in changes in the drug's
   pharmacological activity, some of which are beneficial and some of which
   are harmful. Thus, identifying possible drug-drug interactions (DDIs)
   has always been a crucial research topic in the field of clinical
   pharmacology. As clinical trials are time-consuming and expensive,
   current approaches for predicting DDIs are mainly based on knowledge
   mining from the literature using computational methods. However, since
   the literature contain a large amount of unrelated information, the task
   of identifying drug interactions with high confidence has become
   challenging. Thus, here, we present a novel
   graph-convolutional-network-based method called DDINN to detect
   potential DDIs. Combining cBiLSTM, graph convolutional networks and
   weight-rebalanced dependency matrix, DDINN is able to extract both
   contexture and syntactic information efficiently from the extensive
   biomedical literature. At last, we compare our DDINN with some other
   state-of-the-art models, and it is proved that our work is more
   effective. In addition, the ablation experiments demonstrate the
   advantages of DDINN's optimization techniques as well.

AB We develop a memory graph convolutional network (MGCN) framework for sea
   surface temperature (SST) prediction. The MGCN consists of two memory
   layers: one graph layer and one output layer. The memory layer captures
   SST temporal changes via temporal convolution units and gate linear
   units. The graph layer encodes SST spatial changes in terms of
   characteristics derived from graph Laplacian. The output layer
   encapsulates information from the previous layers and produces SST
   prediction results. The MGCN characterizes both the temporal and spatial
   changes, rendering a comprehensive SST prediction strategy. We use daily
   mean SST data for two areas near the Bohai Sea and the East China Sea
   for experimental evaluations and validate that the MGCN performs better
   than other traditional machine learning methods for nearshore SST
   prediction. In addition, we test the MGCN on weekly and monthly mean SST
   datasets and validate that the MGCN is robust and suitable for SST
   prediction.

AB Aerial scene classification can be treated as the problem of acquiring
   high-level semantic interpretations of the earth-surface images,
   remotely captured from the space or from the aerial vehicles. Although
   the topic is already extensively explored thus far, due to the high
   complexities and diversities in geometrical and spatial texture of
   aerial scenes, there still remain several open challenges. This paper
   primarily focuses on a comparatively new challenge of aerial scene
   classification under labelled sample scarcity, which restricts the
   promising deep network models, such as convolutional neural networks, to
   attain the desired accuracy. Even the graph convolutional networks,
   which have added strength of capturing spatial relationships, fail to
   perform well when trained with limited training samples. We address this
   issue by generating hierarchical semantics-driven multiple graph
   representations for each image, and subsequently, employing graph
   representation learning over these multitude of graphs which act as
   augmented training samples. Our graph-based hierarchical
   semantics-driven model (GrapHiSM) is evaluated using benchmark UC-Merced
   and AID datasets. Experimental results exhibit efficacy of GrapHiSM, in
   handling labelled sample scarcity at the time of aerial scene
   classification.

   dependencies between sensors. We implement sensor fault detection using
   residuals and determine the location of the faulty sensor using a
   directed graph. Finally, we set up several sensor faults based on the
   Tennessee Eastman simulation, and the KDGCN shows satisfactory
   performance in both detection rate and diagnosis results, indicating
   that the injected knowledge and graph structure help to achieve accurate
   sensor fault detection and diagnosis.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gradually become an important research
   branch in graph learning since 2005, and the most active one is
   unquestionably graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). Although
   convolutional neural networks have successfully learned for images,
   voices, and texts, over-smoothing remains a significant obstacle for
   non-grid graphs. In particular, because of the over-smoothing problem,
   most existing GCNs are only effective below four layers. This work
   proposes a novel GCN named DII-GCN that originally integrates Dropedge,
   Initial residual, and Identity mapping methods into traditional GCNs for
   mitigating over-smoothing. In the first step of the DII-GCN, the
   Dropedge increases the diversity of learning sample data and slows down
   the network's learning speed to improve learning accuracy and reduce
   over-fitting. The initial residual is embedded into the convolutional
   learning units under the identity mapping in the second step, which
   extends the learning path and thus weakens the over-smoothing issue in
   the learning process. The experimental results show that the proposed
   DII-GCN achieves the purpose of constructing deep GCNs and obtains
   better accuracy than existing shallow networks. DII-GCN model has the
   highest 84.6% accuracy at 128 layers of the Cora dataset, highest 72.5%
   accuracy at 32 layers of the Citeseer dataset, highest 79.7% accuracy at
   32 layers of the Pubmed dataset.

AB Object-based image classification (OBIC) on very-high-resolution (VHR)
   remote sensing (RS) images is utilized in a wide range of applications.
   Nowadays, many existing OBIC methods only focus on features of each
   object itself, neglecting the contextual information among adjacent
   objects and resulting in low classification accuracy. Inspired by a
   spectral graph theory, we construct a graph structure from objects
   generated from VHR RS images and propose an OBIC framework based on
   truncated sparse singular value decomposition and graph convolutional
   network (GCN) model, aiming to make full use of relativities among
   objects and produce an accurate classification. Through conducting
   experiments on two annotated RS image data sets, our framework obtained
   97.2% and 66.9% overall accuracy, respectively, in automatic and manual
   object segmentation circumstances, within a processing time of about
   1/100 of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods' training

AB Despite the great progress in 3D pose estimation from videos, there is
   still a lack of effective means to extract spatio-temporal features of
   different granularity from complex dynamic skeleton sequences. To tackle
   this problem, we propose a novel, skeleton-based spatio-temporal
   U-Net(STUNet) scheme to deal with spatio-temporal features in multiple
   scales for 3D human pose estimation in video. The proposed STUNet
   architecture consists of a cascade structure of semantic graph
   convolution layers and structural temporal dilated convolution layers,
   progressively extracting and fusing the spatio-temporal semantic
   features from fine-grained to coarse-grained. This U-shaped network
   achieves scale compression and feature squeezing by downscaling and
   upscaling, while abstracting multi-resolution spatio-temporal
   dependencies through skip connections. Experiments demonstrate that our
   model effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal features in
   multiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream
   methods on real-world datasets.

AB Grasping point detection has traditionally been a core robotic and
   computer vision problem. In recent years, deep learning based methods
   have been widely used to predict grasping points, and have shown strong
   generalization capabilities under uncertainty. Particularly, approaches
   that aim at predicting object affordances without relying on the object
   identity, have obtained promising results in random bin-picking
   applications. However, most of them rely on RGB/RGB-D images, and it is
   not clear up to what extent 3D spatial information is used. Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been successfully used for object
   classification and scene segmentation in point clouds, and also to
   predict grasping points in simple laboratory experimentation. In the
   present proposal, we adapted the Deep Graph Convolutional Network model
   with the intuition that learning from n-dimensional point clouds would
   lead to a performance boost to predict object affordances. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first time that GCNs are applied to
   predict affordances for suction and gripper end effectors in an
   industrial bin-picking environment. Additionally, we designed a
   bin-picking oriented data preprocessing pipeline which contributes to
   ease the learning process and to create a flexible solution for any
   bin-picking application. To train our models, we created a highly
   accurate RGB-D/3D dataset which is openly available on demand. Finally,
   we benchmarked our method against a 2D Fully Convolutional Network based
   method, improving the top-1 precision score by 1.8% and 1.7% for suction
   and gripper respectively.

AB Recently, graph convolutional networks have achieved remarkable
   performance with skeleton-based action recognition methods. However,
   there is potential correlation between different parts of the human
   body. Many studies have ignored the fact that different actions are the
   result of the interaction of different human body parts, and that
   operating on the whole graph provides inadequate information to
   characterize the action category. In this study, to pay more attention
   to this problem and further improve the accuracy of action recognition
   models, sub-graphs based on the depth-first tree traversal order were
   used to represent the importance and correlation characteristics of
   joint and bone parts. In addition, beyond the physical structure of the
   body, joint and bone motion information was also introduced to represent
   changes in human body parts with movement. To improve the performance of
   this method, an adaptive-attentional mechanism was added to learn unique
   topology autonomously for each sample and channel domain. The
   multi-stream adaptive-attentional sub-graph convolution network was thus
   proposed for action recognition. The resulting model achieved
   competitive results on the NTU-RGB + D60 dataset based on 2D or 3D
   skeleton poses. The experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of
   our proposed method.

AB Forecasting tasks involving multi-channel time series data pervade
   numerous practical applications and have attracted significant
   attention. Spatio-temporal graph neural network models for multi-channel
   time series forecasting have recently gained traction, owing to their
   ability in capturing both spatial and temporal features. A common
   practice is the integration of graph convolutional networks with
   recurrent neural networks. However, the discrete intervals of recurrent
   neural networks pose limitations on the temporal resolution of time
   series forecasting, impeding the model's ability to capture subtle
   changes in the data. To address this challenge, we introduce a
   continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Graph Ordinary Differential
   Equation Recurrent Network (GODERN). GODERN incorporates continuous
   recurrent neural networks with a learnable and directed graph
   convolution layer to model the spatio-temporal dynamics in latent space.
   Furthermore, given the actual time representation in GODERN, we propose
   a novel augmented method of neural ordinary differential equation with
   fast-slow dynamics, thus allowing the encapsulation of multi-scale
   information. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that GODERN
   achieves superior accuracy on four real-life datasets, outperforming 13
   baseline models.

AB Introduction: Necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (GCN) is a
   standard therapy for patients with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma
   (LSqCC). However, the efficacy and tolerability of GCN in second-line or
   later treatment for patients previously treated with immune checkpoint
   inhibitors (ICIs) remain unknown.
   Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, cohort study assessed the
   efficacy and tolerability of GCN initiated between November 1, 2019 and
   March 31, 2022 as second-line to fourth-line treatment in patients with
   advanced LSqCC who had been pretreated with ICIs. The primary end point
   was progression-free survival (PFS).
   Results: A total of 93 patients from 35 institutions in Japan were
   enrolled. The median PFS, median overall survival (OS), and objective
   response rate were 4.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8-5.3),
   13.3 months (95% CI: 9.6-16.5), and 27.3% (95% CI: 18.3-37.8),
   respectively. The median PFS, median OS, and objective response rate for
   second-line, third-line, and fourth-line treatment groups were 4.8
   months, 3.8 months, and 4.3 months (p= 0.24); 15.7 months, 11.6 months,
   and 10.1 months (p= 0.06); and 31.0%, 13.6%, and 37.5% (p= 0.22),
   respectively. The severity of GCN-related skin disorders was associated
   with longer PFS (p < 0.05) and OS (p < 0.05). The frequencies of grade
   ≥3 skin disorders, hypomagnesemia, pneumonitis, and febrile neutropenia
   were 16.1%, 7.5%, 1.1%, and 4.3%, respectively. There were no
   treatment-related deaths.
   Conclusions: GCN for ICI-pretreated patients with LSqCC seems tolerable
   and offers promising efficacy regardless of treatment line, and ICI
   pretreatment might enhance GCN efficacy.

AB The task of discovering equivalent entities in knowledge graphs (KGs),
   so-called KG entity alignment, has drawn much attention to overcome the
   incompleteness problem of KGs. The majority of existing techniques
   learns the pointwise representations of entities in the Euclidean space
   with translation assumption and graph neural network approaches.
   However, real vectors inherently neglect the complex relation structures
   and lack the expressiveness of embeddings; hence, they may guide the
   embeddings to be falsely generated which results in alignment
   performance degradation. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel
   KG alignment framework, ComplexGCN, which learns the embeddings of both
   entities and relations in complex spaces while capturing both semantic
   and neighborhood information simultaneously. The proposed model ensures
   richer expressiveness and more accurate embeddings by successfully
   capturing various relation structures in complex spaces with high-level
   computation. The model further incorporates relation label and direction
   information with a low degree of freedom. To compare our proposal
   against the state-of-the-art baseline techniques, we conducted extensive
   experiments on real-world datasets. The empirical results show the
   efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB With the rapid development of transportation systems, traffic data have
   been largely produced in daily lives. Finding the insights of all these
   complex data is of great significance to vehicle dispatching and public
   safety. In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model called
   Multitask Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (MRGCN) for accurately
   predicting traffic flows in the city. Specifically, we design a
   multitask framework consisting of four components: a region-flow encoder
   for modeling region-flow dynamics, a transition-flow encoder for
   exploring transition-flow correlations, a context modeling component for
   contextualized fusion of two types of traffic flows and a task-specific
   decoder for predicting traffic flows. Particularly, we introduce
   Dual-attention Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (DGCGRU) to
   simultaneously capture spatial and temporal dependencies, which
   integrate graph convolution and recurrent model as a whole. Extensive
   experiments are carried out on two real-world datasets and the results
   demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several existing
   approaches.

AB Facial expression recognition (FER) is of great interest to the current
   studies of human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel
   geometry-guided facial expression recognition framework, based on graph
   convolutional networks and transformers, to perform effective emotion
   recognition from videos. Specifically, we detect and utilize facial
   landmarks to construct a spatial-temporal graph, based on both the
   landmark coordinates and local appearance, for representing a facial
   expression sequence. The graph convolutional blocks and transformer
   modules are employed to produce high-semantic emotion-related
   representations from the structured facial graphs, which facilitate the
   framework to establish both the local and non-local dependency between
   the vertices. Moreover, spatial and temporal attention mechanisms are
   introduced into graph-based learning to promote FER reasoning, via the
   emphasis on the most informative facial components and frames. Extensive
   experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves promising
   performance for geometry-based FER and shows great generalization and
   robustness in real-world applications.

AB The obfuscation detection technology is an important auxiliary means of
   malware detection. Also, for security practitioners, it can carry out
   automatic obfuscation detection before manual reverse analysis, which
   helps reverse engineers to perform reverse analysis more specifically.
   Existing obfuscation detection methods are mainly for Android
   applications and based on traditional machine learning, whose detection
   granularity is coarse, generality is poor, and the performance is not
   good enough. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
   function-level obfuscation detection method based on Graph Convolutional
   Networks for X86 assembly code and Android applications. Firstly, our
   method is function-level obfuscation detection, and we extract the
   Control Flow Graph (CFG) of each function as its feature, including the
   adjacency matrix and the basic block feature matrix. Secondly, we build
   a hybrid neural network model GCN-LSTM as our obfuscation detection
   model, which combines the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Finally, we conduct experiments using
   real-world open-source programs and compare results with baseline
   methods. For function-level detection, the accuracy of our method is
   94.7575% for X86 assembly code and 98.9457% for Android applications,
   both of which are better than baseline methods. For APKlevel detection,
   our method can almost completely detect the obfuscated APKs.
   Experimental results show that our method performs well for both X86
   assembly code and Android applications and is superior to the baseline
   methods in both function-level detection and APK-level detection. Our
   research showcases a successful application of the Graph Convolutional
   Network and the Control Flow Graph on code obfuscation detection
   problems.

AB The ever-growing available visual data (i.e., uploaded videos and
   pictures by internet users) has attracted the research community's
   attention in the computer vision field. Therefore, finding efficient
   solutions to extract knowledge from these sources is imperative.
   Recently, the BlazePose system has been released for skeleton extraction
   from images oriented to mobile devices. With this skeleton graph
   representation in place, a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
   can be implemented to predict the action. We hypothesize that just by
   changing the skeleton input data for a different set of joints that
   offers more information about the action of interest, it is possible to
   increase the performance of the Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional
   Network for HAR tasks. Hence, in this study, we present the first
   implementation of the BlazePose skeleton topology upon this architecture
   for action recognition. Moreover, we propose the Enhanced-BlazePose
   topology that can achieve better results than its predecessor.
   Additionally, we propose different skeleton detection thresholds that
   can improve the accuracy performance even further. We reached a top-1
   accuracy performance of 40.1% on the Kinetics dataset. For the NTU-RGB+D
   dataset, we achieved 87.59% and 92.1% accuracy for Cross-Subject and
   Cross-View evaluation criteria, respectively.

AB Mobile traffic prediction enables the efficient utilization of network
   resources and enhances user experience. In this paper, we propose a
   state transition graph-based spatial-temporal attention network
   (STG-STAN) for cell-level mobile traffic prediction, which is designed
   to exploit the underlying spatial-temporal dynamic information hidden in
   the historical mobile traffic data. Specifically, we first identify the
   semantic context information over different segments of the historical
   data by constructing the state transition graphs, which may reveal
   different patterns of random fluctuation. Then, based on the state
   transition graphs, a spatial attention extraction module using graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) is designed to aggregate the spatial
   information of different nodes in the state transition graph. Moreover,
   a temporal extraction module is employed to capture the dynamic
   evolution and temporal correlation of the state transition graphs over
   time. Such a spatial-temporal attention network can be further
   integrated with a parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) module to
   improve the accuracy of mobile traffic prediction. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that the STG-STAN can better exploit the spatial-temporal
   information hidden in the state transition graphs, achieving superior
   performance compared with several baselines.

AB Recently, several studies have reported that Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCN) exhibit defects in integrating node features and
   topological structures in graphs. Although the proposal of AMGCN
   compensates for the drawbacks of GCN to some extent, it still cannot
   solve GCN's insufficient fusion abilities fundamentally. Thus it is
   essential to find a network component with stronger fusion abilities to
   substitute GCN. Meanwhile, a Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN)
   proposed by Liu et al. can adaptively aggregate information from
   different hops of neighborhoods, which remarkably benefits its fusion
   abilities. To replace GCN with DAGNN network in AMGCN model and further
   strengthen the fusion abilities of DAGNN network itself, we make further
   improvements based on DAGNN model to obtain DAGNN variant. Moreover,
   experimentally the fusion abilities of the DAGNN variant are verified to
   be far stronger than GCN. And then build on that, we propose a Deep
   Adaptive Multi-channel Graph Neural Network (DAMGNN). The results of
   lots of comparative experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
   the DAMGNN model can extract relevant information from node features and
   topological structures to the maximum extent for fusion, thus
   significantly improving the accuracy of node classification.

AB Action recognition in real-world scenarios is a challenging task which
   involves the action localization and classification for untrimmed video.
   Since the untrimmed video in real scenarios lacks fine annotation,
   existing supervised learning methods have limited effectiveness and
   robustness in performance. Moreover, state-of-the-art methods discuss
   each action proposal individually, ignoring the exploration of semantic
   relationship between different proposals from continuity of video. To
   address these issues, we propose a weakly supervised approach to explore
   the proposal relations using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).
   Specifically, the method introduces action similarity edges and temporal
   similarity edges to represent the context semantic relationship between
   different proposals for graph constructing, and the similarity of action
   features is used to weakly supervise the spatial semantic relationship
   between labeled and unlabeled samples to achieve the effective
   recognition of actions in the video. We validate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method on public benchmarks for untrimmed video (THUMOS14
   and ActivityNet). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   method in this paper has achieved state-of-the-art results, and achieves
   better robustness and generalization performance.

AB Outlier detection is a significant research direction in machine
   learning and has many applications in finance, network security, and
   other areas. Outlier detection of Euclidean datasets is a mainstream
   problem in outlier detection. Most detection methods often ignore the
   connection of its nodes. To collect the representation information of
   feature sets and node connections to improve the detection of outliers
   in Euclidean datasets Accuracy rate, we propose a novel Graph
   Convolutional and Attention-Based Outlier Detection (GCA).The GCA first
   converts the Euclidean structure data into directed graphs using locally
   sensitive hashing; then, by applying a Graph Convolutional Network, the
   data features and their connectivity graph are fed into the neural
   network; secondly, it fuses the extracted features and the features
   reconstructed by the attention mechanism; finally, calculating the
   outlier factors of the objects. Comparing eight state-of-art algorithms
   on ten real-world datasets shows that GCA achieves the highest Area
   Under ROC Curve (AUC) on datasets and also achieves equally good results
   in Accuracy (ACC) and False Alarm Rate (FAR). This study fills the gap
   of upgraded GCNs in detecting outliers to the best of our knowledge and
   provides a new way to convert Euclidean data to graphs.

AB Since human pose can be naturally represented by a graph, graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently been proposed for 3D human
   pose estimation and achieved promising results. But most GCN-based
   methods use vanilla graph convolution which aggregates features of 1-hop
   neighbors and long-range dependencies between joints can only be
   captured by stacking multiple layers of graph convolution. To alleviate
   this problem, we propose a multi-scale graph convolution to aggregate
   features of neighbors at different distances and apply it to nodes with
   specified neighbor types. We further propose a hierarchical-body-pooling
   to aggregate and share body-level and body-part-level context
   information. Based on these components, we finally develop a
   light-weighted GCN for 3D pose lifting by repeatedly stacking a residual
   block of multi-scale graph convolution and a hierarchical-body-pooling
   layer. The experimental results on Human3.6M dataset indicate that our
   network can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much less model
   complexity.

AB In present study, 1D carbon coated tungsten doped molybdenum oxide
   nanowires (WMO@C) were prepared by one step hydrothermal scheme to
   overcome the harmful effects of toxic dyes and infectious bacterial
   strains. The WMO@C nanowires were then integrated with graphitic carbon
   nitride (gCN) to synthesize their ternary nanocomposites to boost up
   photocatalytic and antibacterial activities for environmental
   remediation. XRD results indicated orthorhombic structure of WMO@C with
   crystallite size 4.3 which reduced to 3.53 by integration of gCN. SEM
   micrograph revealed 1D nanowires of synthesized nanophotocatalyst with
   average diameter of 192.33 nm. The WMO, WMO@C and WMO@C/gCN
   nanocomposites were effectively employed for the degradation of colored
   organic contaminants methylene blue (MB), crystal violet (CV), malachite
   green (MG) and colorless diverse effluents benzimidazole and benzoic
   acid and more for inhibition sterilization of P. aeruginosa and S.
   aureus microbes. After 120 min, 91% of MB, 89% of CV, 92% of MG, 65% of
   benzimidazole and 69% of benzoic acid were degraded by WMO@C/gCN
   nanocomposites under visible light. The superior photocatalytic
   competency of WMO@C/gCN was attributed to the enlarged surface area,
   slow photo-induced electron-hole recombination rate, significant charge
   transfer capacity and strong redox ability due to chemical bonds
   developed between gCN and 1D WMO@C nanowires. Different important
   reaction parameters such as pH effect, temperature effect, change in dye
   concentration and photocatalyst dose were studied. Facile synthetic
   route and outstanding photodegradation and antimicrobial performance
   proposes that WMO@C/gCN nanocomposites possess high potential for
   environmental remediation.

AB Gait has unique physiological characteristics and supports long-distance
   recognition, so gait recognition is ideal for areas such as home
   security and identity detection. Methods using graph convolutional
   networks usually extract features in the spatial and temporal dimensions
   by stacking GCNs and TCNs, but different joints are interconnected at
   different moments, so splitting the spatial and temporal dimensions can
   cause the loss of gait information. Focus on this problem, we propose a
   gait recognition network, Multi-scale Spatio-Temporal Gait (MST-Gait),
   which can learn multi-scale gait information simultaneously from spatial
   and temporal dimensions. We design a multi-scale spatio-temporal groups
   Transformer (MSTGT) to model the correlation of intra-frame and
   inter-frame joints simultaneously. And a multi-scale segmentation
   strategy is designed to capture the periodic and local features of the
   gait. To fully exploit the temporal information of gait motion, we
   design a fusion temporal convolution (FTC) to aggregate temporal
   information at different scales and motion information. Experiments on
   the popular CASIA-B gait dataset and OUMVLP-Pose dataset show that our
   method outperforms most existing skeleton-based methods, verifying the
   effectiveness of the proposed modules.

AB Many real-world problems can be abstracted into graph classification
   problems. Recently, graph convolutional networks have achieved great
   success in the task of node classification and link prediction. However,
   when using graph convolution network to process the task of graph
   classification, either global topology information or local information
   is ignored. Therefore, designing graph convolutional networks to improve
   the accuracy of graph classification has attracted more and more
   attention. Inspired by the use of convolutional neural networks to
   process graph-structured data, we put forward a new spatial
   convolutional neural network architecture for graph classification. To
   be specific, we first design a comprehensive weighting method to measure
   the significance of vertices in the graph based on multiple indicators
   to choose the central node sequence. Then, the normalization process of
   the graph is realized by constructing the same size neighborhood graphs
   for the central vertices. After that, the structural characteristics of
   the graph are extracted from both local and global aspects. Finally, the
   tensors obtained after the above steps are respectively input into the
   following two spatial convolutional neural network architectures to
   perform classification, one is a simple CNN structure, which has only
   two convolution layers, one dense layer and one softmax layer. The other
   is to modify the architecture of CNN, and the channel concatenation
   layer is introduced to determine the classification result of the entire
   graph according to the category of the neighborhood graphs. Experimental
   results on two kinds of real-world datasets, bioinformatics and social
   network datasets, indicate that our approach obtains competitive results
   and is superior to some classic kernels and similar deep learning-based
   algorithms on 6 out of 8 benchmark data sets. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

AB As the rolling mill often encounters variable and complicated working
   conditions and shock loads, unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) methods
   are imperative in its health monitoring. However, efforts of applying
   UDA methods on the rolling mill are negligible, and many existing
   approaches have constraints in domain adaptation, domain label, and data
   construction that prevent meaningful features from being extracted.
   Hence, a multi-source domain adversarial graph convolutional networks
   framework (MSDAGCNs) is presented to overcome these challenges and
   combine three essential elements to achieve cross-domain health states
   diagnosis under variable working conditions. First, a shared feature
   extract module is introduced to extract common features. Then, the
   features are input to a multi-source feature extract module to extract
   the data construction from the graphs generated by a graph construction
   module. Meanwhile, a multi-source domain adversarial classifier module
   is modeled to extract multi-source invariant features and classify them.
   After that, the local maximum mean discrepancy is employed to align the
   domain categories. Next, a task classifier module integrates the results
   of the multi-source classifier for reliable health state diagnosis.
   Results on the two cases can verify that the proposed MSDAGCNs can not
   only outperform other state-of-the-art methods, but also extract
   domain-invariant knowledge. Compared with the best-performing method,
   the proposed method can boost accuracy by 0.53% and 0.83% in the
   simplest task of the two case studies, respectively. Furthermore, the
   arrangement of sensors on the rolling mill is discussed to select the
   optimal location for collecting vibrations.

AB Three-dimensional mesh post-processing is an important task because
   low-precision hardware and a poor capture environment will inevitably
   lead to unordered point clouds with unwanted noise and holes that should
   be suitably corrected while preserving the original shapes and details.
   Although many 3D mesh data-processing approaches have been proposed over
   several decades, the resulting 3D mesh often has artifacts that must be
   removed and loses important original details that should otherwise be
   maintained. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D mesh
   completion and denoising system with a deep learning framework that
   reconstructs a high-quality mesh structure from input mesh data with
   several holes and various types of noise. We build upon SpiralNet by
   using a variational deep autoencoder with anisotropic filters that apply
   different convolutional filters to each vertex of the 3D mesh.
   Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the
   reconstruction quality and achieves better accuracy compared to previous
   neural network systems.

AB An effective catalyst for the removal of antibiotic pollutants which
   severely impact water bodies and the environment is most favorable. In
   this study, g-C3N4 (gCN) and nitrogen-doped Bi2MoO6 (gCN-NBM)
   heterostructures are developed using a solvothermal process with
   enhanced photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC) pollutants
   under visible-light irradiation. The experimental results confirm that
   nitrogen-doped Bi2MoO6 (NBM) nanomaterials were dispersed on the gCN
   surface, and a close combination of NBM and gCN leads to the efficient
   photocatalytic performance of TC. The photocatalytic efficiency of the
   heterostructure catalysts is four-fold higher than those of the pristine
   Bi2MoO6 catalysts owing to the excellent photogenerated charge
   separation and reduced recombination rate. Photocurrent measurements and
   electrochemical impedance spectra results disclose that the prepared
   heterostructure catalysts exhibit efficient photo-induced charge
   transfer. The electron spin resonance spectra and quenching experiments
   results reveal that superoxide radicals (.O2-) play a major role in TC
   degradation. This study presents a promising approach for designing
   efficient visible-light photocatalysts for environmental remediation
   applications.

AB Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item at a
   certain time point based on anonymous user behavior sequences. Existing
   methods typically model session representation based on simple item
   transition information. However, since session-based data consists of
   limited users' short-term interactions, modeling session representation
   by capturing fixed item transition information from a single dimension
   suffers from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel
   contrastive multi-level graph neural networks (CM-GNN) to better exploit
   complex and high-order item transition information. Specifically, CM-GNN
   applies local-level graph convolutional network (L-GCN) and global-level
   graph convolutional network (G-GCN) on the current session and all the
   sessions respectively, to effectively capture pairwise relations over
   all the sessions by aggregation strategy. Meanwhile, CM-GNN applies
   hyper-level graph convolutional network (H-GCN) to capture high-order
   information among all the item transitions. CM-GNN further introduces an
   attention-based fusion module to learn pairwise relation-based session
   representation by fusing the item representations generated by L-GCN and
   G-GCN. CM-GNN averages the item representations obtained by H-GCN to
   obtain high-order relation-based session representation. Moreover, to
   convert the high-order item transition information into the pairwise
   relation-based session representation, CM-GNN maximizes the mutual
   information between the representations derived from the fusion module
   and the average pool layer by contrastive learning paradigm. We conduct
   extensive experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets to
   validate the efficacy of the proposed method. The encouraging results
   demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
   SBR techniques.

AB To address the problem of poor detection and under-utilization of the
   spatial relationship between nodes in human pose estimation, a method
   based on an improved spatial temporal graph convolutional network
   (ST-GCN) model is proposed. Firstly, upsampling and segmented random
   sampling strategies are used to effectively solve the problems of class
   imbalance and the large sequence length of the dataset. Secondly, an
   improved detection transformer (DETR) structure is added to effectively
   suppress the generation of non-maximal suppression (NMS) and anchor
   points, a multi-head attention (M-ATT) module is introduced into each
   ST-GCN cell to capture richer feature information, and a residual module
   is introduced into the 9th ST-GCN cell to avoid possible network
   degradation in deep networks. In addition, strategies such as warmup,
   regularization, loss functions, and optimizers are configured to improve
   the model's performance. The experimental results show that the average
   percentage of correct keypoints (PCK) of this method are 93.2% and 92.7%
   for the FSD and MPII datasets, respectively, which is 1.9% and 1.7%
   higher than the average PCK of the original ST-GCN method. Moreover, the
   confusion matrix corresponding to this method also indicated that the
   model has high recognition accuracy. In addition, comparison experiments
   with ST-GCN and other methods show that the computation of the model
   corresponding to this method is about 1.7 GFLOPs and the corresponding
   MACs are about 6.4 GMACs, which is a good performance.

AB Due to the significant concentration of heavy metals in the contaminated
   area, it presents an imminent threat to both living organisms and the
   environment. In this research, we concentrate on finding an effective
   solution for eliminating Cd(II) and U(VI) from water. Our approach
   involves utilizing MgFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets
   combined with graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets to ensure the
   effective elimination of these hazardous metal ions. The
   characterization techniques, including SEM, XPS, XRD, and BET analysis,
   confirmed the hierarchical layered structure of GCN/MgFe LDH with a
   significant surface area of 127.91 m(2)/g. Batch investigations
   demonstrated that the pH of the solution influences the elimination of
   both metal ions, while kinetics and equilibrium data well align with a
   pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model (R-2 = 0.996-1.0),
   respectively. GCN/MgFe LDH demonstrated impressive removal capacities of
   312.30 mg/g and 273.42 mg/g for Cd(II) and U(VI) respectively. A
   thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process of both
   metal ions was endothermic and spontaneous. Furthermore, the GCN/MgFe
   LDH can be reused for over five cycles. In the fourth cycle, it
   maintained a removal percentage of over 95 % for both metal ions when
   0.1 M HNO3 was used for desorption. In continuous column tests, the
   GCN/MgFe LDH reduced metal ion concentrations to levels below USEPA
   standards (<0.005 mg/L and 0.003 mg/L for Cd(II) and U(VI),
   respectively) for up to 4000 bed volumes, demonstrating its potential
   for wastewater treatment.

AB As isoelectronic counterparts of carbon fullerenes, medium-sized boron
   nitride clusters also prefer cage structures composed of even-sized
   polygons. As the cluster size increases, the number of cage isomers
   grows rapidly, and determining the ground state structure requires a
   tremendous amount of DFT calculations. Herein, we develop a graph
   convolutional network (GCN) that can describe the energy of a (BN) n
   cage by its topology connection. We define a vertex feature vector on a
   dual polyhedron by the permutation of the neighbor vertices' degree and
   aggregate the information on vertices by two graph convolutional layers
   to learn the local feature of the dual polyhedron. The GCN is trained on
   (BN)28 and subsequently tested on (BN)23 and (BN)24 data sets, which
   satisfactorily reproduce the order of isomer energies from DFT
   calculations. We further employ the trained GCN to predict the ground
   state structures within the size range of n = 25-32, which agree well
   with DFT results. Using the same GCN framework, we also successfully
   trained the highest-occupied or lowest-unoccupied orbital energies of
   (BN)28 isomers. The present graph convolutional network establishes a
   direct mapping between the topological connection and the energetic or
   electronic properties of a cage-like cluster or molecule.

AB Learning powerful discriminative features is the key for machine fault
   diagnosis. Most existing methods based on convolutional neural network
   (CNN) have achieved promising results. However, they primarily focus on
   global features derived from sample signals and fail to explicitly mine
   relationships between signals. In contrast, graph convolutional network
   (GCN) is able to efficiently mine data relationships by taking graph
   data with topological structure as input, making them highly effective
   for feature representation in non-Euclidean space. In this article, to
   make good use of the advantages of CNN and GCN, we propose a graph
   attentional convolutional neural network (GACNN) for effective
   intelligent fault diagnosis, which includes two subnetworks of fully CNN
   and GCN to extract the multilevel features information, and uses
   Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) attention mechanism to reduce
   information loss. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our
   framework improves the representation ability of features and fault
   diagnosis performance, and achieves competitive accuracy against other
   approaches. And the results show that GACNN can achieve superior
   performance even under a strong background noise environment.

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) has led to state-of-the-art
   performance for structured data. The superior performance would be
   partly due to the convolutional operations that operate over local
   neighborhoods. However, the distant long-range dependencies in data are
   still challenging to capture since it requires deep stacks of
   convolutional operations. Moreover, missing links in structured data
   might further hurt the performance. This paper introduces non-locality
   augmented graph convolution blocks into GCN to capture long-range or
   even disconnected dependencies. Specifically, we propose a
   dictionary-based non-locality encoding approach in which the non-local
   information is encoded by both graph convolution and dictionary-based
   implicit convolution. Unlike previous non-local approaches, our
   non-local block does not rely on the exhaustive computation of the
   relationship of data pairs. Thus, it is suitable for GCN, which
   typically models a large number of data samples. What's more, the
   proposed non-local blocks could be embedded into arbitrarily GCN
   architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our non-local block on
   four benchmark datasets.

   bare GC electrode shows an ill-defined peak and it was unstable whereas
   a well-defined stable oxidation peak was obtained at GC/GCN-S electrode.
   While increasing L-Me concentration from 100 nM to 0.2 mM, the
   amperometric current increases linearly with R-2=0.9901 and LOD was
   found to be 0.32 nM (S/N=3). Finally, GC/GCN-S electrode was used to

AB This study compares the performance of graph convolutional neural
   network (GCN) models with conventional natural language processing (NLP)
   models for classifying scientific literature related to radio frequency
   electromagnetic field (RF-EMF). Specifically, the study examines two GCN
   models: BertGCN and the citation-based GCN. The study concludes that the
   model achieves consistently good performance when the input text is long
   enough, based on the attention mechanism of BERT. When the input
   sequence is short, the composition parameter ?, which combines output
   values of the two subnetworks of BertGCN, plays a crucial role in
   achieving high classification accuracy. As the value of ? increases, the
   classification accuracy also increases. The study also proposes and
   tests a simplified variant of BertGCN, revealing performance differences
   among the models under two different data conditions by the existence of
   keywords. This study has two main contributions: (1) the implementation
   and testing of a variant of BertGCN and citation-based GCN for document
   classification tasks related to radio frequency electromagnetic fields
   publications, and (2) the confirmation of the impact of model
   conditions, such as the existence of keywords and input sequence length,
   in the original BertGCN. Although this study focused on a specific
   domain, our approaches have broader implications that extend beyond
   scientific publications to general text classification.

AB Background: Early detection of complex diseases like hepatocellular
   carcinoma remains challenging due to their network-driven pathology.
   Dynamic network biomarkers (DNB) based on monitoring changes in
   molecular correlations may enable earlier predictions. However, DNB
   analysis often overlooks disease heterogeneity.Methods: We integrated
   DNB analysis with graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to identify
   critical transitions during hepatocellular carcinoma development in a
   mouse model. A DNB-GCN model was constructed using transcriptomic data
   and gene expression levels as node features.Results: DNB analysis
   identified a critical transition point at 7 weeks of age despite
   histological examina-tions being unable to detect cancerous changes at
   that time point. The DNB-GCN model achieved 100% accuracy in classifying
   healthy and cancerous mice, and was able to accurately predict the
   health status of newly introduced mice.Conclusion: The integration of
   DNB analysis and GCN demonstrates potential for the early detection of
   complex diseases by capturing network structures and molecular features
   that conventional biomarker discovery methods overlook. The approach
   warrants further development and validation.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

   To bring significant time-savings, this paper presents a graph
   convolutional network (GCN)-based SCUC approach (GCN-SCUC) using the
   information of power grid topology. Instead of tackling the mixed
   integer linear programming (MILP)-based SCUC (MILP-SCUC), the GCN
   learner predicts the unit decisions first, and then the MILP-SCUC
   problem is transformed into a continuous convex one. Numerical
   experiments are performed on the modified IEEE-30 and IEEE-118 systems
   to verify the feasibility of our approach both in terms of accuracy and
   computation time. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art
   MILP-SCUC, the proposed approach achieves speedups of between 13x and
   17x on different testing examples with high accuracy.(c) 2023 The

AB Multiple faults often occur in the operation of rotating machinery
   transmission systems. The fault signals of multiple bearings interfere
   with each other, which makes feature extraction and diagnosis of complex
   compound fault signals difficult. Because the graph convolution networks
   (GCN) can effectively map the structural information from complex data
   and its model has a certain generalization ability, this paper proposes
   a multiple fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings employing
   complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and a GCN
   (CEEMD-GCN) based on a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). Firstly, in
   order to highlight the effective feature information in the multiple
   fault signal and reduce noise interference, multiple indicators of
   correlation and kurtosis are used to reconstruct the decomposed signals
   through CEEMD; secondly, the reconstructed signals are constructed as an
   HVG, and the HVG maps the time series signal to the graphic structure
   data, reflecting the local geometric characteristics of the vibration
   signal through the horizontal visibility relationship; finally, taking
   the signal samples obtained by the HVG algorithm as the input data of
   the model, the GCN model is trained to realize the diagnosis of multiple
   faults. The experimental results show that the presented methodology is
   superior to other methods and exhibits generalization ability for
   multiple fault diagnosis.

AB IntroductionEstablishing a driving fatigue monitoring system is of
   utmost importance as severe fatigue may lead to unimaginable
   consequences. Fatigue detection methods based on physiological
   information have the advantages of reliable and accurate. Among various
   physiological signals, EEG signals are considered to be the most direct
   and promising ones. However, most traditional methods overlook the
   functional connectivity of the brain and fail to meet real-time
   requirements.MethodsTo this end, we propose a novel detection model
   called Attention-Based Multi-Semantic Dynamical Graph Convolutional
   Network (AMD-GCN). AMD-GCN consists of a channel attention mechanism
   based on average pooling and max pooling (AM-CAM), a multi-semantic
   dynamical graph convolution (MD-GC), and a spatial attention mechanism
   based on average pooling and max pooling (AM-SAM). AM-CAM allocates
   weights to the input features, helping the model focus on the important
   information relevant to fatigue detection. MD-GC can construct intrinsic
   topological graphs under multi-semantic patterns, allowing GCN to better
   capture the dependency between physically connected or non-physically
   connected nodes. AM-SAM can remove redundant spatial node information
   from the output of MD-GC, thereby reducing interference in fatigue
   detection. Moreover, we concatenate the DE features extracted from 5
   frequency bands and 25 frequency bands as the input of
   AMD-GCN.ResultsFinally, we conduct experiments on the public dataset
   SEED-VIG, and the accuracy of AMD-GCN model reached 89.94%, surpassing
   existing algorithms.DiscussionThe findings indicate that our proposed
   strategy performs more effectively for EEG-based driving fatigue
   detection.

AB The construction of Schottky junctions is considered to be an efficient
   way to boost spatial charge separation and transfer in photocatalytic
   systems. In this work, we construct the Schottky junction using
   zero-dimensional (0D) Ti2CO2 nanoclusters (TCO) and two-dimensional (2D)
   g-C3N4 (GCN), denoted as TCO/GCN. The interfacial interaction,
   separation of photogenerated carriers, and reaction driving force of the
   TCO/GCN have been investigated based on density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. TCO can serve as an electron acceptor due to the larger
   work function relative to the semiconductor GCN. The band bending caused
   by the interfacial charge prevents the electrons from flowing back to
   the semiconductor, which can effectively separate the photo-excited
   carriers. The metal sites exposed at the edge of TCO exhibit high
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This study provides a new
   idea for the development of 0D/2D Schottky junction photocatalysts.

AB Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have emerged as an effective
   approach to extending deep learning for graph data analytics, but they
   are computationally challenging given the irregular graphs and the large
   number of nodes in a graph. GCNs involve chain sparse-dense matrix
   multiplications with six loops, which results in a large design space
   for GCN accelerators. Prior work on GCN acceleration either employs
   limited loop optimization techniques, or determines the design variables
   based on random sampling, which can hardly exploit data reuse
   efficiently, thus degrading system efficiency. To overcome this
   limitation, this paper proposes GShuttle, a GCN acceleration scheme that
   maximizes memory access efficiency to achieve high performance and
   energy efficiency. GShuttle systematically explores loop optimization
   techniques for GCN acceleration, and quantitatively analyzes the design
   objectives (e.g., required DRAM accesses and SRAM accesses) by
   analytical calculation based on multiple design variables. GShuttle
   further employs two approaches, pruned search space sweeping and greedy
   search, to find the optimal design variables under certain design
   constraints. We demonstrated the efficacy of GShuttle by evaluation on
   five widely used graph datasets. The experimental simulations show that
   GShuttle reduces the number of DRAM accesses by a factor of 1.5 and
   saves energy by a factor of 1.7 compared with the state-of-the-art
   approaches.

AB The working condition of high-speed train wheelset bearings is complex
   and bad, which makes its vibration signal contain strong noise. To
   obtain more information of samples, signals are constructed into graphs
   and fit by graph convolution network (GCN). The existing GCN-based
   models still have some problems, such as insufficient theoretical basis
   of graph and the unstable and overfitting during training of models,
   which significantly limits the diagnosis accuracy. To address these
   issues, first, a weighted e-recurrence network is proposed to construct
   the recurrence graph (RG). The recurrence relationship between samples
   is analyzed by the recursive nature of vibration signals. Maximum mean
   discrepancy (MMD) is used to obtain the regenerated Hilbert spatial
   distribution distance between two samples to reduce the weight gap
   between different recursive pairs. Also, the proposed method has better
   ex ante interpretability. Second, a vertex mean normalization (MN) layer
   is proposed to normalize individual vertex features to introduce some
   spatial perturbations and reduce the variance of vertex features, which
   can improve training stability and reduce overfitting. In addition,
   multichannel MN-GCN is proposed to fit multiscale graph features.
   Analyze recurrence nature of samples at different scales through RGs
   with varying densities of connection to improve the antinoise ability.
   Experimental results show that the proposed model can obtain spatial
   topology information accurately and improve the wheelset-bearing system
   fault diagnosis performance.

AB We address the problem of robust face alignment in the presence of
   occlusions, which remains a lingering problem in facial analysis despite
   intensive long-term studies. This paper proposes an adaptive
   attention-based graph convolutional network for face alignment.
   Different from most existing methods that ignore the structural
   information, we combine local features and global structural
   relationships to construct the landmark-connection graph and optimize
   the graph to improve the robustness of the model under occlusion
   conditions. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph convolutional
   network architecture consisting of three parts: GCN-global, GCN-local,
   and the adaptive channel attention module. GCN-global estimates the
   global transformation of landmarks through 3D face fitting to obtain
   initial coordinates. Considering the interaction between vertexes and
   edges in the graph, GCN-local jointly trains local edges and vertexes to
   improve the accuracy. The channel attention module can adaptively select
   essential features to enhance the performance. In addition, to reduce
   the influence of occlusion parts on the other landmarks and improve the
   working efficiency, we apply the preprocessing module to select which
   keypoints need to be connected. Our method achieves 5.17% mean error
   with 1.89% failure rate on COFW dataset and 4.16% mean error on
   300W-Full dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
   outperforms most state-of-the-art models on three public datasets,
   including WFLW, COFW, and 300W.

AB Nowadays, with the rapid expansion of social media as a means of quick
   communication, real-time disaster information is widely disseminated
   through these platforms. Determining which real-time and multi-modal
   disaster information can effectively support humanitarian aid has become
   a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model,
   named GCN-based Multi-modal Domain Adaptation (GMDA), which consists of
   three essential modules: the GCN-based feature extraction module, the
   attention-based fusion module and the MMD domain adaptation module. The
   GCN-based feature extraction module integrates text and image
   representations through GCNs, while the attention-based fusion module
   then merges these multi-modal representations using an attention
   mechanism. Finally, the MMD domain adaptation module is utilized to
   alleviate the dependence of GMDA on source domain events by computing
   the maximum mean discrepancy across domains. Our proposed model has been
   extensively evaluated and has shown superior performance compared to
   state-of-the-art multi-modal domain adaptation models in terms of F1
   score and variance stability.

AB This study constructed a new aqueous solubility dataset and a solubility
   regression model which was ensembled by GCN and machine learning models.
   Aqueous solubility is a key physiochemical property of small molecules
   in drug discovery. In the past few decades, there have been many studies
   about solubility prediction. However, many of these studies have high
   root mean squared error (RMSE). Meanwhile, their dataset always contains
   salt compounds and solubility data obtained from different experimental
   conditions. In this paper, we constructed a clean dataset with 2609
   compounds, which was small but contains only solubility records without
   salts at the same temperatures (25 degrees C). Here, we applied graph
   convolutional neural network (GCN) to construct an aqueous solubility
   prediction model. To enhance the performance of the model, the molecular
   MACCS key fingerprints and physiochemical descriptors were also combined
   with the GCN model to build a multi-channel model. Additionally, the
   authors also built two machine learning models (support vector
   regression and gradient boost decision tree) and assembled them to the
   GCN model to improve the root mean squared error (RMSE= 0.665). Finally,
   comparative experiments have shown that our framework achieved the best
   performance on ESOL dataset (RMSEval = 0.56, RMSEtest = 0.44) and
   surpassed four established software on aqueous solubility prediction of
   new compounds.

AB BiFe1-2xMnxMgxO3 (BFMM, x - 0-8%) was mixed with exfoliated g-C3N4 (GCN)
   to form a composite for establishing an S-scheme heterojunction for
   photodegradation. BFMM was synthesized by sol-gel method, and showed a
   decreased band gap from 2.24 eV to 1.75 eV as x increased from 0% to 7%,
   allowing a more efficient absorption of sunlight. GCN was prepared by
   thermal polymerization of melamine and then exfoliated to form
   nanosheets by sulfur acid in order to increase the specific surface area
   and thus increase reaction sites. A composite with a weight ratio of
   BFMM/GCN equal to 1 : 3 was prepared by sintering the powder mixture at
   300 degrees C. Such a composite showed a greatly improved efficiency in
   photodegradation of methylene blue, which was over 6 times faster than
   pristine BiFeO3, and the Mn/Mg co-doping improved the efficiency by 48%.
   The Mott-Schottky plots showed that both GCN and BFMM are n-type
   semiconductors with flat-band potentials of -0.79 and +0.11 V (vs. NHE),
   respectively. So, the band alignment allowed the S-scheme to work,
   leading to an efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and
   holes, which was confirmed by the greatly increased photocurrents
   measured with the composites.

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) has gained widespread attention in
   semisupervised classification tasks. Recent studies show that GCN-based
   methods have achieved decent performance in numerous fields. However,
   most of the existing methods generally adopted a fixed graph that cannot
   dynamically capture both local and global relationships. This is because
   the hidden and important relationships may not be directed exhibited in
   the fixed structure, causing the degraded performance of semisupervised
   classification tasks. Moreover, the missing and noisy data yielded by
   the fixed graph may result in wrong connections, thereby disturbing the
   representation learning process. To cope with these issues, this article
   proposes a learnable GCN-based framework, aiming to obtain the optimal
   graph structures by jointly integrating graph learning and feature
   propagation in a unified network. Besides, to capture the optimal graph
   representations, this article designs dual-GCN-based meta-channels to
   simultaneously explore local and global relations during the training
   process. To minimize the interference of the noisy data, a
   semisupervised graph information bottleneck (SGIB) is introduced to
   conduct the graph structural learning (GSL) for acquiring the minimal
   sufficient representations. Concretely, SGIB aims to maximize the mutual
   information of both the same and different meta-channels by designing
   the constraints between them, thereby improving the node classification
   performance in the downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on
   real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model,
   which outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fixed-structure graphs.

AB Monitoring the land covers in complex landscapes is of great
   significance for the sustainable development of mine geo-environments.
   As most existing remote sensing scene datasets are composed of RGB
   images, there is a lack of multimodal datasets for complex landscapes
   with mining land covers (MLCs) at a fine-scale. In this study, a new
   dataset was created by the China University of Geosciences (CUG), Wuhan
   (named CUG-MLCs) using ZiYuan-3 imagery-based multispectral and
   topographic data. Moreover, the characteristics of multisize objects,
   irregular or blurred edges, and spectral-spatial-topographic
   heterogeneity and variability limited the classification accuracy.
   Therefore, an edge enhanced channel attention-based graph convolution
   network (ECA-GCN) was proposed and tested. The proposed ECA-GCN includes
   three key modules. 1) Multiscale and shallow feature fusion, used to
   fuse the multiscale convolutional features and shallow features, which
   helps present the MLC features with various scales; 2) edge enhanced
   channel attention, used to further select effective channels after a
   spatial edge feature enhancement, which helps identify irregular or
   blurred MLCs; and 3) edge detection-based GCN, used for edge
   feature-based adjacency matrix and feature maps from (2) to construct
   GCN, which can obtain edge node relation and global contextual
   information. This framework improved the representation of complex
   landscape characteristics. The proposed ECA-GCN achieved an overall
   accuracy of 66.60% +/- 1.39%, averaged accuracy of 36.25% +/- 1.50%, and
   Kappa of 55.91% +/- 2.05%, thus, outperforming other models. In general,
   the proposed dataset and model were positive for the fine classification
   of complex landscapes.

   commercial friction material formulation with the addition of bulk
   (named: gCN) and exfoliated (named: TEX6) graphitic carbon nitride in
   varying quantities: 4.5, 9, 13.5, and 18 wt%. The analysis was two-fold.
   In the first part, the samples were tested in the form of pins on a pin
   on disc testing equipment. The typical trend was that the friction
   coefficient magnitude increased with the addition of gCN. On the other
   hand, the friction coefficient decreased with the TEX6 addition. The pin
   wear reduced with the addition of gCN until 9 wt%. Beyond this amount,
   an increase in pin wear was observed. The TEX6 samples generally noted a
   decrease in pin wear with the increase in its content. An improvement in
   the characteristics of the secondary plateaus was seen with the increase
   in both gCN and TEX6 content. Through this study, the 13.5 wt% addition
   of both gCN and TEX6 was considered to display permissible friction and
   wear magnitude, and desirable extension and compaction of secondary
   contact plateaus. In the second part of the study, the formulation with
   13.5 wt% of gCN and TEX6 was tested on a subscale dynamometer to
   replicate a real-life braking scenario. The friction and wear magnitudes
   were similar to the pin on disc study and the extension of the secondary
   contact plateaus was better than the virgin formulation. This study
   provides a complete analysis of the feasibility of the inclusion of
   g-C3N4 variations in automotive braking applications.

AB Objective. Whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography
   (PET/CT) scans are an important tool for diagnosing various malignancies
   (e.g. malignant melanoma, lymphoma, or lung cancer), and accurate
   segmentation of tumors is a key part of subsequent treatment. In recent
   years, convolutional neural network based segmentation methods have been
   extensively investigated. However, these methods often give inaccurate
   segmentation results, such as oversegmentation and undersegmentation. To
   address these issues, we propose a postprocessing method based on a
   graph convolutional network (GCN) to refine inaccurate segmentation
   results and improve the overall segmentation accuracy. Approach. First,
   nnU-Net is used as an initial segmentation framework, and the
   uncertainty in the segmentation results is analyzed. Certain and
   uncertain pixels are used to establish the nodes of a graph. Each node
   and its 6 neighbors form an edge, and 32 nodes are randomly selected as
   uncertain nodes to form edges. The highly uncertain nodes are used as
   the subsequent refinement targets. Second, the nnU-Net results of the
   certain nodes are used as labels to form a semisupervised graph network
   problem, and the uncertain part is optimized by training the GCN to
   improve the segmentation performance. This describes our proposed
   nnU-Net + GCN segmentation framework. Main results. We perform tumor
   segmentation experiments with the PET/CT dataset from the MICCIA2022
   autoPET challenge. Among these data, 30 cases are randomly selected for
   testing, and the experimental results show that the false-positive rate
   is effectively reduced with nnU-Net + GCN refinement. In quantitative
   analysis, there is an improvement of 2.1% for the average Dice score,
   6.4 for the 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), and 1.7 for the average
   symmetric surface distance. Significance. The quantitative and
   qualitative evaluation results show that GCN postprocessing methods can
   effectively improve the tumor segmentation performance.

AB Microplastics (MPs) are pollutants generated by plastic debris of
   diameters <= 5 mm and are a global concern that can pose severe threats
   to human and environmental health in both aquatic and terrestrial areas.
   In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE, MW = similar to 35000)
   blended with Ru-incorporated g-C3N4 (Ru-gCN) was fabricated to examine
   its degradation efficiency. Plastic film (Ru-gCN@PE) degradation was
   performed by adding an aqueous medium with pH values ranging from 1 to 6
   and at different temperatures (0, 35, 50, and 70 degrees C). The
   Ru-gCN@PE showed a significant weight loss of approximately 66.04,
   74.51, and 69.64 wt% in pH 3 at 0, 50, and 70 degrees C, respectively,
   upon light irradiation for 24 h. The high activity of Ru-gCN can result
   from the formation of a heterojunction of Ru and g-C3N4 (Ru-gCN), which
   facilitates the transfer of the photoinduced pi electrons of g-C3N4.
   Moreover, H+ is produced at an appropriate pH and temperature to further
   convert into hydroperoxides and accelerate the formation of
   macroradicals ((ROO)-R-center dot, (RO)-R-center dot, and (OH)-O-center
   dot) for plastic degradation, which follows the Norrish Type I and II
   mechanisms. Our study demonstrated the outstanding efficacy of the
   photocatalytic degradation of LDPE.

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) as a combination of deep learning (DL)
   and graph learning has gained increasing attention in hyperspectral
   image (HSI) classification. However, most GCN methods consider the
   simple point-to-point structure between two pixels rather than the
   high-order structure of multiple pixels, which is contradict with the
   real feature distribution of ground object. And the nonlinear property
   of HSI also brings challenge for precise structural representation in
   GCN. To tackle these problems, this work proposes a structure-preserved
   hyper GCN (SPHGCN). It first builds a multiple neighborhood
   reconstruction (MNR) model to reveal the essential resemblance of
   multiple pixels in nonlinear spectral feature space. With the high-order
   structure, SPHGCN designs the hypergraph convolution operation for
   irregular feature aggregation among similar pixels from different
   regions, which achieves more discriminative features from multiple pixel
   nodes. Meanwhile, a structure preservation layer (SPL) is built to
   optimize the distribution of convolutional features under the guidance
   of high-order structure. Moreover, SPHGCN integrates local regular
   convolution and irregular hypergraph convolution to learn the structured
   semantic feature of HSI. This strategy breaks the boundary restriction
   in traditional convolution and aggregates semantic feature across
   different image patches. Experiments on three HSI datasets indicate that
   SPHGCN outperforms a few state-of-the-art methods for HSI
   classification.

AB The growing demand for energy, as well as the impact on the environment
   as a result of human activity, has prompted a renewed focus on the
   development of cleaner alternative fuels. Because of its pure combustion
   products, hydrogen gas is being used as an alternative in the
   development of sustainable energy sources. A simple hydrothermal
   technique was used to prepare copper nickel tin sulphide (CNTS)
   decorated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN). CNTS-gCN samples were further
   prepared on different concentrations of gCN that varies from CNTS-gCN(10
   mg-50mg) and analyzed under various characterization for its structural,
   morphological, and electrochemical properties. Field Emission Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Raman and HR-TEM (High
   Resolution-Transmitting Electron Microscopy) techniques were used to
   examine the morphology and surface structure of CNTS-gCN. Owing to its
   exclusive electrocatalytic property as low charge transfer resistance
   and high electrochemically active surface area, the composite material
   reveals a superior catalytic stability for the production of hydrogen
   energy. The hierarchical flower like structures were still maintained
   even after the addition of g-CN at different loading concentrations
   (10-50) respectively. The objective of this research is to prepare a new
   electrocatalyst based on CNTS with an increased HER activity.& COPY;

AB Methane is one of the most dangerous gases produced in the process of
   coal mining. Because of its flammable and explosive characteristics, it
   has seriously threatened the life and property safety of coal miners. As
   a result, accurate and real-time gas concentration forecasting is
   becoming a crucial but challenging issue for reducing methane risks and
   accidents. To further improve the efficiency and accuracy of methane
   concentration forecasting, this paper proposes a graph convolutional
   encoder-decoder (GCN-ED) network, which can train and infer all the
   sensors of a coal face as a unified entity. The proposed GCN-ED is
   composed of the GCN module and the ED module with a parallel structure.
   The GCN module constructs a priori graph structure through the adjacency
   relation between sensors in reality and uses a learnable self-adaptive
   dependency matrix to precisely capture the hidden spatial dependency in
   the data. The ED module is used to learn complex temporal features with
   LSTM cells and generate multi-step results of the gas concentration
   prediction. Experiments are conducted on real coal mine datasets, whose
   results demonstrate that the GCN-ED achieves the better performance than
   various state-of-the-art solutions and largely improves the efficiencies
   of training processes.

AB Accurate house price prediction allows construction investors to make
   informed decisions about the housing market and understand the growth
   opportunities for development and the risks and rewards of different
   construction projects. Machine learning (ML) models have been utilized
   as house price predictors, reducing decision-making costs, and
   increasing reliability. To further improve the reliability of the
   existing predictors, this study develops a hybrid multiedge graph
   convolutional network (GCN) that considers the various relationships
   between house price records. The developed hybrid multiedge GCN receives
   richer input from the multidependency information and thus provides a
   more reliable prediction that accounts for price changes based on the
   neighborhood, building age, and number of bedrooms. Compared to other ML
   approaches, the developed multiedge GCN house price predictor displayed
   good prediction accuracy while providing valuable insights into the
   factors that affect the house price, such as the desirability of
   different neighborhoods and building age.
   In the context of construction management and property valuation, the
   multiedge GCN model introduces an enhanced level of reliability for
   house price prediction. It stands out with its improved
   interpretability, rooted in its ability to maintain the inherent
   structure of the house price data set. This added transparency provides
   professionals with a more profound understanding and trust in prediction
   outcomes. By encompassing the richer content of the house price data set
   that includes the multidependency information, the model presents a
   comprehensive view of house price data sets, facilitating a more
   accurate and thorough understanding of housing market patterns. As a
   result, the GCN model matches the accuracy of other ML models while
   providing greater interpretability and transparency. This model's
   capabilities are expected to arm investors, contractors, and
   policymakers with valuable insights, aiding informed decision-making. It
   is also envisaged as a beneficial tool for construction project owners
   and contractors in refining budgets and informed investment decisions.
   The synthesis of transparency, representativeness, and accuracy makes
   this model a dependable tool for construction managers to make informed
   decisions, ultimately enhancing their operational efficacy.

AB Emotion classification along with sentimental analysis in dialogues is a
   complex task that has currently attained immense popularity. When
   communicating their thoughts and feelings, humans are prone to having
   many emotions of varying intensities. The task is complicated and
   fascinating since emotions in a dialogue utterance can be independent or
   based on the preceding utterances. Additional details such as audio and
   video, along with text facilitates in the identification of the right
   emotions with the corresponding intensity and appropriate sentiments in
   a dialogue. In this work, we focus on the task of predicting multiple
   emotions and their corresponding intensity along with sentiments in a
   given utterance of a dialogue. With the release of MEISD dataset, the
   task of simultaneously predicting the sentiments along with multiple
   emotions with intensity from a given utterance of a conversation
   utilizing the knowledge from textual, audio and visual cues has gained
   significance in conversational systems. We design an Affect-GCN
   framework that utilizes an RNN-GCN network as an utterance encoder
   followed by Multimodal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling for enhance
   representation of different modalities. The proposed Affect-GCN
   framework shows an improvement of 0.7 in terms of Jaccard index for
   multi-label emotion classification while an increase of 0.3 for
   intensity prediction. Experimental analysis shows that our proposed
   Affect-GCN framework outperforms the existing approaches and several
   baselines for the task of multi-label emotion classification, intensity
   prediction and sentiment analysis in dialogues.

AB Carbon-based heterojunctions, because of their low toxicity and
   non-polluting properties, are considered as metal-free alternatives to
   the traditional metal oxide semiconductors for energy and environmental
   ap-plications especially in acidic conditions. In this work, an
   all-carbon heterojunction using exfoliated gra-phitic carbon nitride
   (GCN) and porous carbon derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework
   (CZ8) is developed for chromium (VI) decontamination. The enhanced
   charge-transfer in the GCN:CZ8 hetero-junctions, due to the suppressed
   electron-hole pair recombination, is evidenced from photoluminescence
   (PL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent (TP) measurements and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This phenomenon
   significantly contributes towards improving the photo-induced
   decontamination of the noxious Cr(VI). Moreover, the band gap of the
   optimized GCN:CZ8 heterojunction is 2.48 eV which is relatively narrow
   than that of the GCN (2.79 eV). Nearly 100 % removal is achieved with
   the as-synthesized GCN:CZ8 heterojunction even with chromium solution of
   100 ppm concentration. The X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   results suggest the facile reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under the
   influence of incident photons, and most importantly, the performance
   efficiency of the heterojunction is maintained similar to 100 % up to
   five continuous cycles. Herein, the optimized GCN:CZ8 heterojunction is
   established as a potential ma-terial towards efficient decontamination
   of Cr(VI) from water.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification methods based on the graph
   convolutional network (GCN) have received more attention because they
   can handle irregular regions by graph encoding techniques. However,
   GCN-based HSI classification methods are highly sensitive to the quality
   of the graph structure. Its performance degrades in the case of
   underdeveloped graphs because it cannot excavate the intrinsic adjacency
   relationships. Thus, it is necessary to improve the quality of graph
   structure in GCN-based methods. In this article, a novel
   diversity-connected GCN (DCGCN) method is proposed to improve the
   quality of the graph structure for HSI classification, and its basic
   idea can be adopted by other GCN-based methods. First, the potential
   neighbors are excavated by performing topological extensions based on
   the given graph. The diversity of surrounding neighbors is maintained by
   adaptively smoothing operation via a global threshold value from
   Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to eliminate weak interclass
   connections caused by weakly spectral variability. Second, another key
   connectivity restriction is imposed on the diverse neighbors to further
   refine the ambiguous connections of hard samples aiming at removing
   strong interclass connections where the spectral information is heavily
   confounded. Finally, the DCGCN method is analyzed theoretically to
   demonstrate its low-pass filter property. The comprehensive experiments
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCGCN method and the basic
   idea of the diversity-connected graph in terms of overall accuracy (OA),
   kappa coefficient (KC), and average accuracy (AA) indices.

   and disease-causing genes, which may assist precision medicine and drug
   design in AD and serve as a valuable reference for other neurological
   disorders.

AB As one of foundation technologies for massive data processing for AI,
   event mining is attracting more and more attention, mainly including
   event detection (event trigger identification and event classification)
   and argument extraction. At present, EE-GCN is one of the most effective
   methods for event detection. However, since EE-GCN only focuses on event
   detection, complete event multi-tuple extraction needs to be improved.
   Inspired by the EE-GCN event detection method, this paper proposes an
   effective event extraction method via graph convolutional network
   indication with a hierarchical argument selection strategy. The method
   mainly includes the following steps. (1) Based on the ACE2005 argument
   extraction template, a new argument extraction template is established
   for the Baidu event extraction dataset. (2) The trigger events and event
   classification detected by EE-GCN are used as indicators to determine
   the argument extraction template, and the alternative arguments are
   extracted via named entity recognition based on the determined template.
   (3) Making full use of the side information of EE-GCN graph to solve the
   local and global correlation degree, and based on the local and global
   correlation degrees, the final argument multi-tuple is determined. (4)
   Finally, several experiments are conducted on the Baidu event extraction
   dataset to compare the proposed method with other methods. The
   experimental results show that the proposed method has improved the
   accuracy and completeness of the event extraction compared to other
   existing methods.

AB With the powerful representative ability of learning human skeleton, the
   graph convolutional network (GCN) is a popular baseline for 3D human
   pose estimation (HPE). However, current GCN-based 3D HPE methods
   primarily use "message-passing" architectures to aggregate the node
   information through the edges of the graph at "one scale". In such
   architectures, the learnt node features are uniform and cannot learn
   hierarchical representation of the graph-structured data. In this study,
   a hierarchically stacked graph network (HSGNet) with attention
   constraint for 3D HPE was proposed. An attention-constrained GCN layer
   (AGCN) was designed as the basic unit for constructing the HSGNet. With
   the specially designed AGCN layer, we computed the attention
   coefficients for each node to pick the most important node and
   suppressed the redundant information from the neighbors in feature
   aggregation. Then, a coarse graph layer with pooling map was devised for
   stacking the multiple GCN layers in a hierarchical manner, where a
   pooling map matrix was used to cluster the nodes for graph
   representation according to the human skeleton structure. Finally, an
   HSGNet was constructed in an encoder-decoder framework to further embed
   the global and local information of the full skeleton to achieve the
   final embedding feature for 3D pose regression. Our method was validated
   on two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental
   results showed that the proposed method yielded good performance for 3D
   HPE.

AB Studies have shown that contextual information can promote the
   robustness of trackers. However, trackers based on convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs) only capture local features, which limits their
   performance. We propose a novel relevant context block (RCB), which
   employs graph convolutional networks to capture the relevant context. In
   particular, it selects the k largest contributors as nodes for each
   query position (unit) that contain meaningful and discriminative
   contextual information and updates the nodes by aggregating the
   differences between the query position and its contributors. This
   operation can be easily incorporated into the existing networks and can
   be easily end-to-end trained using a standard backpropagation algorithm.
   To verify the effectiveness of RCB, we apply it to two trackers, SiamFC
   and GlobalTrack, respectively, and the two improved trackers are
   referred to as Siam-RCB andGlobalTrack-RCB. Extensive experiments onOTB,
   VOT, UAV123, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OxUvA, and VOT2018LT show the
   superiority of our method. For example, our Siam-RCB outperforms SiamFC
   by a very large margin (up to 11.2% in the success score and 7.8% in the
   precision score) on the OTB-100 benchmark.

AB Decomposing a 3D face shape into different attribute components is
   usually beneficial to many applications, such as 3D face generation and
   attribute transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn
   independent latent representations of 3D face shapes to decompose a
   given 3D face shape into identity and expression components. We assume
   that the identity describes the intrinsic geometry of a face while the
   expression captures the extrinsic one, and thus they are independent of
   each other. Based on this assumption, we encode a 3D face shape into its
   identity and expression representations by a variational inference
   framework, that is equipped with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN).
   Furthermore, we introduce a binary discriminator to enforce the latent
   representations of identity and expression to be distribution
   independent by adversarial learning. Both qualitative and quantitative
   experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve
   state-of-the-art results in 3D face shape decomposition. Extensive
   applications on 3D facial expression transfer, 3D face recognition, and
   3D face generation further demonstrate that the proposed method can
   achieve visually better transferred expressions, purer identity
   representations, and more diverse 3D face shapes, compared with existing
   state-of-the-art methods.

AB Entity alignment is an effective means of matching entities from various
   knowledge graphs (KGs) that represent the equivalent real-world object.
   With the development of representation learning, recent entity alignment
   methods learn entity structure representation by embedding KGs into a
   low-dimensional vector space, and then entity alignment relies on the
   distance between entity vectors. In addition to the graph structures,
   relations and attributes are also critical to entity alignment. However,
   most existing approaches ignore the helpful features included in
   relations and attributes. Therefore, this paper presents a new solution
   RAEA (Relation Awareness and Attribute Involvement for Entity
   Alignment), which includes relation and attribute features. Relation
   representation is incorporated into entity representation by Dual-Primal
   Graph CNN (DPGCNN), which alternates convolution-like operations on the
   original graph and its dual graph. Structure representation and
   attribute representation are learned by graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs). To further enrich the entity embedding, we integrate the textual
   information of the entity into the entity graph embedding. Moreover, we
   fine-tune the entity similarity matrix by integrating fine-grained
   features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets from
   real-world KGs show that our approach has superior performance to other
   representative entity alignment approaches in most cases.

AB With the increasing number of software bugs, bug fixing plays an
   important role in software development and maintenance. To improve the
   efficiency of bug resolution, developers utilize bug reports to resolve
   given bugs. Especially, bug triagers usually depend on bugs'
   descriptions to suggest priority levels for reported bugs. However,
   manual priority assignment is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To
   resolve this problem, recent studies have proposed many approaches to
   automatically predict the priority levels for the reported bugs.
   Unfortunately, these approaches still face two challenges that include
   words' nonconsecutive semantics in bug reports and the imbalanced data.
   In this article, we propose a novel approach that graph convolutional
   networks (GCN) based on weighted loss function to perform the priority
   prediction for bug reports. For the first challenge, we build a
   heterogeneous text graph for bug reports and apply GCN to extract words'
   semantics in bug reports. For the second challenge, we construct a
   weighted loss function in the training phase. We conduct the priority
   prediction on four open-source projects, including Mozilla, Eclipse,
   Netbeans, and GNU compiler collection. Experimental results show that
   our method outperforms two baseline approaches in terms of the F-measure
   by weighted average of 13.22%.

AB Complex networks necessitate the identification of key nodes owing to
   their ubiquity across the network. Traditional methodologies, such as
   machine learning-based and centrality-based techniques, evaluate node
   relevance only on network topologies or node properties. Nevertheless,
   both network topologies and node attributes must be considered at the
   time of evaluating the relevance of nodes. As a solution to this
   problem, this study presents OlapGN, a deep learning model that uses
   Graph Convolutional Networks to identify the most significant nodes in a
   complicated network. By integrating the two modules (deep learning and
   probabilistic nature), the proposed technique identifies overlapping
   groups and the most significant nodes within a complex network. The
   suggested approach determines the most significant individuals of the
   overlapping community after identifying their overlap. Several
   experiments have been conducted on actual social networks, such as VAST,
   Facebook, Medicine, Computer Science, and DBLP to evaluate the efficacy
   of the proposed model. In locating the overlapping communities and most
   significant nodes in heterogeneous complex networks, the proposed method
   has produced far better results than all other prevailing methods used
   for the purpose.

AB The need for computational models that can incorporate imaging data with
   non-imaging data while investigating inter-subject associations arises
   in the task of population-based disease analysis. Although off-the-shelf
   deep convolutional neural networks have empowered representation
   learning from imaging data, incorporating data of different modalities
   complementarily in a unified model to improve the disease diagnostic
   quality is still challenging. In this work, we propose a generalizable
   graph-convolutional framework for population-based disease prediction on
   multi-modal medical data. Unlike previous methods constructing a static
   affinity population graph in a hand-crafting manner, the proposed
   framework can automatically learn to build a population graph with
   variational edges, which we show can be optimized jointly with spectral
   graph convolutional networks. In addition, to estimate the predictive
   uncertainty related to the constructed graph, we propose Monte-Carlo
   edge dropout uncertainty estimation. Experimental results on four
   multi-modal datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can
   substantially improve the predictive accuracy for Autism Spectrum
   Disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and ocular diseases. A sufficient
   ablation study with in-depth discussion is conducted to evaluate the
   effectiveness of each component and the choice of algorithmic details of
   the proposed method. The results indicate the potential and
   extendability of the proposed framework in leveraging multi-modal data
   for population based disease prediction. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Human action recognition based on skeleton currently has attracted a
   wide range of attention. The structure of skeleton data exists in the
   form of graph, thus most researchers use graph convolutional networks
   (GCN) to model skeleton sequences. However, the graph convolution
   network shares the same weight for all neighbor nodes and relies on the
   connection of graph edges. We introduce a method, a spatial-temporal
   graph attention networks (ST-GAT), to overcome the disadvantages of GCN.
   First, the ST-GAT defines the spatial-temporal neighbor nodes of the
   root node and the aggregation function through the attention mechanism.
   The adjacency matrix is only used in GAT to define related nodes, and
   the calculation of association weight is dependent on the feature
   expression of nodes. Then ST-GAT network attaches the obtained attention
   coefficient to each neighbor node to automatically learn the
   representation of spatiotemporal skeletal features and output the
   classification results. Extensive experiments on two challenging
   datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method. (C)

AB Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been employed for
   graph matching problem. It can integrate graph node feature embedding,
   node-wise affinity learning and matching optimization together in a
   unified end-to-end model. However, first, the matching graphs feeding to
   existing graph matching networks are generally fixed and independent of
   graph matching task, which thus are not guaranteed to be optimal for the
   graph matching task. Second, existing methods generally employ
   smoothing-based graph convolution to generate graph node embeddings, in
   which extensive smoothing convolution operation may dilute the desired
   discriminatory information of graph nodes. To overcome these issues, we
   propose a novel Graph Learning-Matching Network (GLMNet) for graph
   matching problem. GLMNet has three main aspects. (1) It integrates graph
   learning into graph matching which thus adaptively learns a pair of
   optimal graphs for graph matching task. (2) It further employs a
   Laplacian sharpening graph convolution to generate more discriminative
   node embeddings for graph matching. (3) A new constraint regularized
   loss is designed for GLMNet training which can encode the desired
   one-to-one matching constraints in matching optimization. Experiments
   demonstrate the effectiveness of GLMNet. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This paper discusses shadow detection problem, and proposes a
   light-weight network to achieve both accurate detection results and high
   computation efficiency. Firstly, we begin by presenting a compact
   network for realtime shadow detection. Secondly, to improve the
   performance of our light-weight networks, we propose two complementary
   and necessary strategies, i.e., the use of extra training data and
   knowledge distillation. Note that collecting a large amount of extra
   data will lead to the following challenge: shadow scenes is various,
   while annotating for those complex scenarios is time-consuming and
   expensive, sometimes even need expert help. To solve it, in the first
   step, we introduce a novel shadow annotation strategy based on graph
   convolutional networks, namely Anno-GCN, to provide extra training
   pairs, which obtains a complete shadow mask via only several annotation
   scribbles. In the second step, we can combine knowledge distillation
   with these sufficient GCN-labeled training data to further improve the
   performance of the light-weight network. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that our method can achieve a state-of-the-art inference
   accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability with only about
   2.97 M parameters.

AB Learning-based shadow detection methods have achieved an impressive
   performance, while these works still struggle on complex scenes,
   especially ambiguous soft shadows. To tackle this issue, this work
   proposes an efficient shadow detection network (ESDNet) and then applies
   uncertainty analysis and graph convolutional networks for detection
   refinement. Specifically, we first aggregate global information from
   high-level features and harvest shadow details in low-level features for
   obtaining an initial prediction. Secondly, we analyze the uncertainty of
   our ESDNet for an input shadow image and then take its intensity,
   expectation, and entropy into account to formulate a semi-supervised
   graph learning problem. Finally, we solve this problem by training a
   graph convolution network to obtain the refined detection result for
   every training image. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive
   experiments on several benchmark datasets, i.e., SBU, UCF, ISTD, and
   even on soft shadow scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our
   strategy can improve shadow detection performance by suppressing the
   uncertainties of false positive and false negative regions, achieving
   state-of-the-art results.

AB Attributed graph clustering is a challenging task as it requires to
   jointly model graph structure and node attributes. Although recent
   advances in graph convolutional networks have shown the effectiveness of
   graph convolution in combining structural and content information, there
   is limited understanding of how to properly apply it for attributed
   graph clustering. Previous methods commonly use a fixed and low order
   graph convolution, which only aggregates information of few-hop
   neighbours and hence cannot fully capture the cluster structures of
   diverse graphs. In this paper, we first propose an adaptive graph
   convolution method (AGC) for attributed graph clustering, which exploits
   high order graph convolutions to capture global cluster structures and
   adaptively selects an appropriate order k via intra-cluster distance.
   While AGC can find a reasonable k and avoid over-smoothing, it is not
   sensitive to the gradual decline of clustering performance as k
   increases. To search for a better k , we further propose an improved
   adaptive graph convolution method (IAGC) that not only observes the
   variation of intra-cluster distance, but also considers the
   inconsistencies of filtered features with graph structure and raw
   features, respectively. We establish the validity of our methods by
   theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various benchmark
   datasets.

AB Human action recognition based on the graph convolution network (GCN) is
   a hot topic in computer vision. Existing GCN-based methods fail to
   capture internal implicit information when extracting action features,
   thereby leading to over-smoothing in the training stage. These issues
   result in poor performance and inaccurate extraction of action features.
   To address these problems, a new GCN is constructed. In this paper, a
   human skeleton feature optimizer (SFO) and adaptive structure
   enhancement graph convolution network (ASE-GCN) for action recognition
   are proposed in an end-to-end manner. To obtain discriminative features,
   the SFO is proposed to construct a new skeleton representation for
   action recognition through the connection criterion, which extracts the
   internal implicit information of action. The action feature of the joint
   coordinates is extracted by graph structure mask (GSM), directed graph
   mapping (DGM), and adaptive pooling operation (APO) in the proposed
   ASE-GCN network. The GSM acts as the regularizer of skeleton structure
   information to strengthen the representation of the graph structure. The
   DGM correlates the directed graph with human motion information through
   kinematic principle, and the APO strengthens the global high-frequency
   features to alleviate over-smoothing. The proposed method achieves
   comparable or superior results over state-of-the-art methods when used
   in experiments on two large public-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D and
   Kinetics.

AB Traffic flow prediction is of paramount importance in the field of
   spatio-temporal forecasting. In recent years, research efforts have
   primarily been directed towards developing intricate graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) to capture spatial complexities. However, this has
   inadvertently led to the neglect of the inherent temporal correlations
   in traffic prediction, as well as the heterogeneity of graph structures.
   As a result, existing models show limited efficacy when dealing with the
   complex nature of traffic data. To address this issue, this paper
   introduces a novel traffic prediction model: the Fourier-enhanced
   heterogeneous graph convolution attention recurrent network (FEHGCARN).
   This model integrates historical information and incorporates a graph
   convolution attention recurrent unit (GCARU), meticulously engineered to
   effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, it
   features a Fourier-enhanced heterogeneous graph learning module, which
   facilitates the acquisition of complex relationships among nodes in the
   frequency domain. Notably, this memory network excels at recognizing
   abrupt traffic conditions. To validate our approach, we conducted
   comprehensive comparisons using three authentic datasets and benchmarked
   our model against six state-of-the-art baseline methods. The
   experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance
   of our model across all evaluation metrics.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for
   representation learning on graph data, which can capture structural
   patterns on a graph via specifically designed convolution and readout
   operations. In many graph classification applications, GCN-based
   approaches have outperformed traditional methods. However, most of the
   existing GCNs are inefficient to preserve local information of graphs -
   a limitation that is especially problematic for graph classification. In
   this work, we propose a locality-preserving dense GCN with graph
   context-aware node representations. Specifically, our proposed model
   incorporates a local node feature reconstruction module to preserve
   initial node features into node representations, which is realized via a
   simple but effective encoder-decoder mechanism. To capture local
   structural patterns in neighborhoods representing different ranges of
   locality, dense connectivity is introduced to connect each convolutional
   layer and its corresponding readout with all previous convolutional
   layers. To enhance node representativeness, the output of each
   convolutional layer is concatenated with the output of the previous
   layer's readout to form a global context-aware node representation. In
   addition, a self-attention module is introduced to aggregate layer-wise
   representations to form the final graph-level representation.
   Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
   proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification
   accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge graph (KG) embedding models map nodes and edges to
   fixed-length vectors and obtain the similarity of nodes as the output of
   a scoring function to predict missing links between nodes. KG embedding
   methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently
   gained significant attention due to their ability to add information of
   neighboring nodes into the nodes' embeddings. However, existing GCNs are
   primarily based on real-valued embeddings, which have high distortion,
   particularly when modeling graphs with varying geometric structures. In
   this paper, we propose complex graph convolutional network (ComplexGCN),
   a novel extension of the standard GCNs in complex space to combine the
   expressiveness of complex geometry with GCNs for improving the
   representation quality of KG components. The proposed ComplexGCN
   comprises a set of complex graph convolutional layers and a complex
   scoring function based on PARATUCK2 decomposition: the former includes
   information of neighboring nodes into the nodes' embeddings, while the
   latter leverages these embeddings to predict new links between nodes.
   The proposed model demonstrates enhanced performance compared to
   existing methods on the two recent standard link prediction datasets.

AB Knowledge graph embedding models are used to learn low-dimensional
   representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. In this
   paper, we propose Multi-RAttE, an attention-based learning method for
   multiple relational knowledge graph embedding representation, which
   divides the information transfer in the knowledge graph into
   cross-relational information transfer and relation-specific information
   transfer, and divides the embedding of knowledge graph entities into
   structural embedding and multi-relational embedding for joint learning.
   To objectively analyse the performance of the Multi-RAttE model, we
   select two typical datasets and different representative baseline models
   for experimental evaluation on several tasks such as link prediction,
   multi-relation prediction and node classification. The experimental
   results show that the Multi-RAttE model improves 8% over the
   state-of-the-art model Composition-based Multi-Relational Graph
   Convolutional Networks (CompGCN) in terms of Hits@1 metric on the link
   prediction task on FB15k-237 dataset; on the multi-relation prediction
   task, the accuracy improves by 1.8% and 3.7% in the auc metric and F1
   metric, respectively. The experimental results have proved that the
   Multi-RAttE model can effectively perform the representation of multiple
   relations.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been widely used for various
   classification problems. However, the traditional ELMs are typically
   based on the regular Euclidean data, thus ignoring the intrinsic
   structured information among data and resulting in poor robustness. In
   this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised learning framework,
   termed Graph Convolutional Extreme Learning Machines (GCELM), based on
   extending the traditional ELM to the non-Euclidean domain. Technically,
   we recast ELM layers into a randomized graph convolutional embedding
   layer followed by a graph convolutional regression layer, which endows
   ELM with the capability to handle graphs in the non-Euclidean domain.
   Benefiting from the diversity of the randomized graph convolution, we
   further propose an enhanced GCELM, i.e., Voting-based GCELM (V-GCELM),
   by using a simple voting ensemble strategy. The proposed methods
   preserve the advantages of ELMs, thus being more efficient than the
   gradient-based graph convolutional networks but without loss of graph
   learning ability. Extensive experiments on 36 benchmark datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform many
   previous semi-supervised classification methods.

AB Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive disorder affecting
   millions of individuals, presenting a significant global health concern.
   Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) serves as a crucial tool in
   revealing functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD, playing
   an essential role in precise diagnosis. However, the limited data
   availability of FC poses challenges for robust MDD diagnosis. To tackle
   this, some studies have employed Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
   architectures to construct Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for
   synthetic FC generation, but this tends to overlook the inherent
   topology characteristics of FC. To overcome this challenge, we propose a
   novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based Conditional GAN with
   Class-Aware Discriminator (GC-GAN). GC-GAN utilizes GCN in both the
   generator and discriminator to capture intricate FC patterns among brain
   regions, and the class-aware discriminator ensures the diversity and
   quality of the generated synthetic FC. Additionally, we introduce a
   topology refinement technique to enhance MDD diagnosis performance by
   optimizing the topology using the augmented FC dataset. Our framework
   was evaluated on publicly available rs-fMRI datasets, and the results
   demonstrate that GC-GAN outperforms existing methods. This indicates the
   superior potential of GCN in capturing intricate topology
   characteristics and generating high-fidelity synthetic FC, thus
   contributing to a more robust MDD diagnosis.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
   task, which needs to detection the sentiment polarity towards a Ygiven
   aspect. Recently, graph neural models over the dependency tree are
   widely applied for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Most existing works,
   however, they generally focus on learning the dependency information
   from contextual words to aspect words based on the dependency tree of
   the sentence, which lacks the exploitation of contextual affective
   knowledge with regard to the specific aspect. In this paper, we propose
   a graph convolutional network based on SenticNet to leverage the
   affective dependencies of the sentence according to the specific aspect,
   called Sentic GCN. To be specific, we explore a novel solution to
   construct the graph neural networks via integrating the affective
   knowledge from SenticNet to enhance the dependency graphs of sentences.
   Based on it, both the dependencies of contextual words and aspect words
   and the affective information between opinion words and the aspect are
   considered by the novel affective enhanced graph model. Experimental
   results on multiple public benchmark datasets illustrate that our
   proposed model can beat state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to complex spatial correlations, dynamic temporal trends, and
   heterogeneities, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a
   challenging task for multi-sensor complex systems. Existing frameworks
   usually design complex graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for
   multi-sensor information fusion to capture shared patterns with
   predefined graphs. However, predefined graphs do not necessarily reflect
   correct and complete correlations among sensors. Furthermore, dynamic
   temporal trend extraction based on an iterative mechanism will bring the
   challenge of error accumulation from a global perspective and ignore the
   heterogeneous correlations. To overcome these limitations, a novel graph
   neural network framework, namely, Spatial- temporal Dual-channel
   Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (SDAGCN), is proposed for RUL
   prediction. It mainly consists of dual channels, including the local and
   global spatial-temporal modules with learnable graphs, which adaptively
   capture hidden spatial correlations. Benefiting from these two modules,
   SDAGCN can effectively extract hidden spatial correlations along the
   local and global time axis and heterogeneities. Finally, the superior
   performance of our model is verified by two simulated aircraft engine
   dataset with multiple sensors.

AB Building indoor dangerous behavior recognition is a specific application
   in the field of abnormal human recogni-tion. A human dangerous behavior
   recognition method based on LSTM-GCN with attention mechanism (GLA)
   model was proposed aiming at the problem that the existing human
   skeleton-based action recognition methods cannot fully extract the
   temporal and spatial features. The network connects GCN and LSTM network
   in series, and inputs the skeleton sequence extracted by GCN that
   contains spatial information into the LSTM layer for time sequence
   feature extraction, which fully excavates the temporal and spatial
   features of the skeleton sequence. Finally, an attention layer is
   designed to enhance the features of key bone points, and Softmax is used
   to classify and identify dangerous behaviors. The dangerous behavior
   datasets are derived from NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics data sets. Experimental
   results show that the proposed method can effectively identify some
   dangerous behaviors in the building, and its accuracy is higher than
   those of other similar methods.

AB The rapid development in knowledge graph (KG) technology and its
   popularity in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have
   significantly increased the support for similar KG-based applications.
   However, there is a concerning problem regarding KGs; most of them are
   often incomplete. This motivated us to study knowledge graph completion
   (KGC). Some recent studies have used graph neural networks (GNN) such as
   graph convolutional networks (GCN) to model graph-structured data,
   providing good results on KGC tasks. However, the edge weights in GCN
   models are controlled by degree, a measure that moderately ignores the
   differences among relation information. To address the above limitations
   and obtain better KGC, we propose a model based on graph attention
   networks (GATs) and contrastive learning (CL), called the CLGAT-KGC
   model. This model introduces the graph attention mechanism and adds
   different representations of entities under the same entity
   corresponding to different relations to enhance the entity-relation
   message function. Additionally, a new CL method is proposed under the
   CLGAT-KGC model to better learn the embedding of entities and relations
   in the KG domain. We have completely verified the effectiveness of this
   model through extensive experiments.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   mucoadhesive wall materials for nanoparticles, respectively. GCN
   nanoparticles (NPs; size = 357 nm and polydispersity index = 0.188)
   prepared by ionic gelation between CS and CR exhibited synergistic
   antimicrobial activity between grapefruit seed extract and cinnamon oil
   and significantly higher antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus

   antibacterial activity of GCN was significantly increased and sustained
   by nanoencapsulation in the mouth-rinse test and GCN NP-treated drinking

AB Online car-hailing has become an indispensable transportation means for
   residents. The short-term origin and destination (OD) prediction of
   online car-hailing trips is conducive to understanding the inflow and
   outflow of online car-hailing trips in a region and provides data
   support for the delivery and scheduling of vehicles. Accordingly, this
   article takes the data of car-hailing trips in the central area of
   Haikou, China, as the research data; makes an in-depth analysis of the
   regularities of car-hailing trips; and divides the central area of
   Haikou into 84 grids with a length of 3 km. This article constructs
   three adjacency matrices, Am01, Sam, and Amn, to reflect the complex
   spatial relationships of the OD matrixes of online car-hailing from
   different perspectives. Then, a model, based on the graph convolutional
   network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit, denoted as the temporal GCN
   (T-GCN), is introduced for the grid-based short-term OD prediction. The
   case study in Haikou shows that T-GCNs based on the three adjacency
   matrices are better than other models, wherein the Amn-based T-GCN is
   more consistent with the OD flows' spatial relationship, achieves the
   best prediction performance, and shows that there exists a proportional
   relationship between flows on different OD pairs. The application of the
   research results is beneficial for the car-hailing platform to perform
   the dynamic scheduling of vehicles in advance, further improving the
   operating efficiency and reducing the waiting time of passengers so as
   to effectively alleviate the problem of the imbalance between the supply
   and demand of online car-hailing travel.

AB Text classification is an important and classic application in natural
   language processing (NLP). Recent studies have shown that graph neural
   networks (GNNs) are effective in tasks with rich structural
   relationships and serve as effective transductive learning approaches.
   Text representation learning methods based on large-scale pretraining
   can learn implicit but rich semantic information from text. However, few
   studies have comprehensively utilized the contextual semantic and
   structural information for Chinese text classification. Moreover, the
   existing GNN methods for text classification did not consider the
   applicability of their graph construction methods to long or short
   texts. In this work, we propose Chinese-BERTology-wwm-GCN, a framework
   that combines Chinese bidirectional encoder representations from
   transformers (BERT) series models with whole word masking
   (Chinese-BERTology-wwm) and the graph convolutional network (GCN) for
   Chinese text classification. When building text graph, we use documents
   and words as nodes to construct a heterogeneous graph for the entire
   corpus. Specifically, we use the term frequency-inverse document
   frequency (TF-IDF) to construct the word-document edge weights. For long
   text corpora, we propose an improved pointwise mutual information (PMI &
   DBLBOND;) measure for words according to their word co-occurrence
   distances to represent the weights of word-word edges. For short text
   corpora, the co-occurrence information between words is often limited.
   Therefore, we utilize cosine similarity to represent the word-word edge
   weights. During the training stage, we effectively combine the
   cross-entropy and hinge losses and use them to jointly train
   Chinese-BERTology-wwm and GCN. Experiments show that our proposed
   framework significantly outperforms the baselines on three Chinese
   benchmark datasets and achieves good performance even with few labeled
   training sets.

AB To unravel the role of active site type and its coordination environment
   in regulating catalytic performance, C2H2 selective hydrogenation over a
   series of single-atom Pt1/Cu catalysts was fully investigated using DFT
   calcula-tions and microkinetic modeling. Four types of Pt active site,
   including the defect, step, corner, and terrace sites with the
   generalized coordination number (GCN) from 2.5 to 7.5, are examined. Our
   results indicate that Pt1/Cu catalysts with four types of active sites
   favor gas phase C2H4 formation in C2H2 hydrogenation process. C2H4
   activity has an inverted volcanic-type curve relationship with d-band
   center and GCN of Pt active site. For the polymerization process, the
   corner and terrace sites with larger GCN values could prevent green oil.
   The screened PtGCN3.0 catalyst with corner site exhibits better C2H4
   selectivity and activity and prevents green oil. Hence, tuning the type
   and GCN value of Pt active site well regulate C2H4 activity and
   selectivity, as well as catalyst stability, which provide useful
   structure information to rationally design Pt-based catalysts in C2H2
   selective hydrogenation.

   increasing attention in the field of intelligent recognition and

   performances. In this paper, a novel GCN-based approach is proposed by
   introducing a convolutional block attention module (CBAM)-based graph
   attention block to compute the semantic correlations between any two
   vertices. By considering semantic correlations, our model can
   effectively identify the most discriminative vertex connections
   associated with specific actions, even when the two vertices are

AB In pristine graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), amino groups often function
   as structural defects that trap photogenerated charges, resulting in low
   photocatalytic activity as well as reaction with nitrite, aldehyde,
   etc., ensuing in poor product yield. Without significantly altering the
   optical characteristics, the removal of amino groups is necessary to
   increase the photocatalytic activity and structural stability of
   pristine g-CN. The deamino graphitic carbon nitride (DA-gCN-5) was
   prepared by tert-butyl nitrite (TBN)treatment, characterized and used as
   a photocatalyst for the radical C-H arylation of heteroarenes using
   anilines as radical source. Indeed, the photophysical characteristics of
   DA-gCN-5 and those of pristine g-CN are very comparable, except that
   DA-gCN-5 has a fewer residual amino groups, higher crystallinity, and
   compressed structure with a different morphology. Moreover, DA-gCN-5-
   catalyzed C-H arylation reaction offers greater product yield in a
   shorter reaction time compared to that of pristine g-CN in the coupling
   between heteroarenes and the in situ generated aryl diazonium salts from
   anilines under visible light irradiation. The amino groups in pristine
   g-CN absorbed the TBN that was added to convert aniline into the
   appropriate diazonium ions during the reaction. As a result, deamino
   graphitic carbon nitride produced by chemical treatment has better
   photophysical properties and catalytic activity than pristine g-CN.
   Additionally, this is the first method that uses diazotization reaction
   for the preparation of deamino graphitic carbon nitride, as far as we
   are aware.

   electrochemical storage performance of supercapacitors,
   g-C3N4/WO3(H2O)0.33 (GCN/ WO) nanostructures have been prepared in a
   simple wet impregnation process by mixing the synthesized g-C3N4, and
   WO3(H2O)0.33 materials and their performances were compared
   systematically with their individual components. The successful
   formation of C3N4/WO3(H2O)0.33 nanostructure has been confirmed by the
   XRD, SEM, EDS, HR-TEM, HAADF and XPS spectroscopy analyses. The prepared
   GCN/WO nanostructures showed greater specific capacitance of 466.88C g-1
   at 1.5 A g-1 than their counterparts (GCN 87.87C g-1 and WO 140.64C g-1)
   with remarkable cyclic stability of 98.6% over 10000 cycles. Notably,
   the fabricated hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor devices (HASDs)
   exhibited ultrahigh power density of 255.23 W kg-1 at energy density of
   10.07 Wh kg-1. The enhanced electrochemical capacitor characteristics of
   GCN/WO nanostructures could be attributed to the positive synergistic
   effect of GCN and WO. Thus, the strategy utilizing this synergistic
   effect between GCN and WO in a simple impregnation process is a viable
   alternative to fabricate the high capacitance electrodes for application
   in supercapacitors.

AB Fast oil recovery from the ocean after an oil spill is crucial before
   permanent damage happens to the ecological balance and marine life.
   Sorbents that are usually used to recover oil from water are not
   environmentally friendly and involve complicated synthesis routes.
   Against this backdrop, we have discovered that pristine porous graphitic
   carbon nitride (GCN), as developed here via a one-step one precursor
   (i.e., melamine) facile synthesis route, is a high-capacity and stable
   oil sorbent. The GCN, sans any additive/support, has exhibited > 100%
   oil adsorption, at a rapid rate, for different types of oils from the
   surface of as-prepared artificial sea water; with the capability of it
   being reused multiple times, without any detectable change in the
   structure or drop in adsorption %, after simply burning off the adsorbed
   oil in air. As established here, the 'oil take-up' happens via
   physisorption, sans any chemical reaction/change of GCN structure/bonds
   post-adsorption, which renders the sorbent material highly stable.
   Hence, this work demonstrates the superior oil adsorption capabilities
   of easy-to-synthesize, scalable, and environmentally friendly GCN,
   toward a straightforward, eco-friendly, and widespread oil recovery
   solution.

AB Machine learning methods are becoming increasingly popular to anticipate
   critical risks in patients under surveillance reducing the burden on
   caregivers. In this paper, we propose an original modeling that benefits
   of recent developments in Graph Convolutional Networks: a patient's
   journey is seen as a graph, where each node is an event and temporal
   proximities are represented by weighted directed edges. We evaluated
   this model to predict death at 24 hours on a real dataset and
   successfully compared our results with the state of the art.

AB This research endeavor aims to fabricate a novel ternary heterojunction
   interface to enhance photoelectrochemical water Oxidation. ZnSe/GCN/MoS2
   heterostructure series is prepared via the ultrasonication method.
   Confirmation of as-prepared heterostructures was done through FTIR, XRD,
   SEM, EDS, XPS, Raman, UVDRS, and PL techniques. The best photoresponse
   among the ternary series was found for 1% ZnSe/GCN/MoS2 (1ZGM), showing
   the highest photocurrent density of 1.73 mA during linear sweep
   voltammetric studies. This is an increase of 7 times in the
   photoresponse than the pure GCN. These outcomes are reinforced by the
   EIS results, showing the smallest semicircle for 1ZGM in a Nyquist plot
   and an enhanced lifetime of 100.7 ms in a bode plot. The smallest Tafel
   slope, higher donor density, and reduced electron-hole recombination,
   suggest that a ternary heterojunction is successfully fabricated for PEC
   water oxidation.

AB Despite extensive research, 3D face reconstruction from a single image
   remains an open research prob-lem due to the high degree of variability
   in pose, occlusions and complex lighting conditions. While deep
   learning-based methods have achieved great success, they are usually
   limited to near frontal images and images that are free of occlusions.
   Also, the lack of diverse training data with 3D annotations considerably
   limits the performance of such methods. As such, existing methods fail
   to recover, with high fidelity, the facial details especially when
   dealing with images captured under extreme conditions. To address this
   issue, we propose an unsupervised coarse-to-fine framework for the
   reconstruction of 3D faces with detailed textures. Our core idea is that
   multiple images of the same person but captured under different viewing
   conditions should provide the same 3D face. We thus propose to leverage
   a self-augmentation learning technique to train a model that is robust
   to diverse variations. In addition, instead of directly employing image
   pixels, we use a set of discriminative features describing the identity
   and attributes of the face as input to the refinement module, making the
   model invariant to viewing conditions. This combination of
   self-augmentation learning with rich face-related features allows the
   reconstruction of plausible facial details even under challenging
   viewing conditions. We train the model end-to-end and in a
   self-supervised manner, without any 3D annotations, landmarks or
   identity labels, using a combina-tion of an image-level photometric loss
   and a perception-level loss that is identity and attribute-aware. We
   evaluate the proposed approach on CelebA and AFLW2000 datasets, and
   demonstrate its robustness to appearance variations despite learning
   from unlabeled images. The qualitative comparisons indicate that our
   method produces detailed 3D faces even under extreme occlusions, out of
   plane rotations and noise perturbations where existing state-of-the-art
   methods often fail. We also quantitatively show that our method
   outperforms SOTA with more than 30.14%, 9.87% and 11.3% in terms of
   PSNR, SSIM and IDentity similarity, respectively. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Water ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental conditions,
   including meteorological factors, which influence dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentrations, a critical indicator of water quality. However, the
   complex relationships between multiple meteorological factors from
   various sites and DO concentrations pose a significant challenge for
   accurate prediction. This study introduces an innovative framework for
   enhancing DO concentration predictions in water bodies by integrating
   multi-station meteorological data. We first construct a dynamic
   meteorological graph with station-specific factors as node features and
   geographic distances as edge weights. This graph is processed using a
   Geo-Contextual Graph Embedding Module, leveraging a Graph Convolutional
   Network (GCN) to distill geographical and meteorological features from
   multi-station data. Extracted features are encoded and then temporally
   merged with historical DO values to form time-series data. Finally, a
   Temporal Transformer module is used for future DO concentration
   predictions. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to
   traditional methods, successfully capturing the complex relationships
   between meteorological factors and DO levels. It provides an effective
   tool for environmental scientists and policymakers in water quality
   monitoring and management. This study suggests that the integration of
   graph-based learning and a Temporal Transformer in environmental
   modeling is a promising direction for future research.

AB Establishing the structure-property relationship by machine learning
   (ML) models is extremely valuable for accelerating the molecular design
   of polymers. However, existing ML models for the polymers are subject to
   scarcity issues of training data and fewer variations of graph
   structures of molecules. In addition, limited works have explored the
   interpretability of ML models to infer the latent knowledge in the field
   of polymer science that could inspire ML-assisted molecular design. In
   this contribution, we integrate graph convolutional neural networks
   (GCNs) with data augmentation strategy to predict the glass transition
   temperature T-g of polymers. It is demonstrated that the data-augmented
   GCN model outperforms the conventional models and achieves a higher
   accuracy for the prediction of T-g despite a small amount of training
   data. Furthermore, taking advantage of molecular graph representations,
   the data-augmented GCN model has the capability to infer the importance
   of atoms or substructures from the understanding of T-g, which generally
   agrees with the experimental findings in the field of polymer science.
   The inferred knowledge of the GCN model is used to advise on the design
   of functional polymers with specific T-g. The data-augmented GCN model
   possesses prominent superiorities in the establishment of
   structure-property relationship and also provides an efficient way for
   accelerating the rational design of polymer molecules.

AB Graphs are widely used to model various practical applications. In
   recent years, graph convolution networks (GCNs) have attracted
   increasing attention due to the extension of convolution operation from
   traditional grid data to graph one. However, the representation ability
   of current GCNs is undoubtedly limited because existing work fails to
   consider feature interactions. Toward this end, we propose a Dual
   Feature Interaction-based GCN. Specifically, it models feature
   interaction in the aspects of 1) node features where we use Newton's
   identity to extract different-order cross features implicit in the
   original features and design an attention mechanism to fuse them; and 2)
   graph convolution where we capture the pairwise interactions among nodes
   in the neighborhood to expand a weighted sum operation. We evaluate the
   proposed model with graph data from different fields, and the
   experimental results on semi-supervised node classification and link
   prediction demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCN. The data
   and source codes of this work are available at

AB Sparse tensor-times-vector (SpTV) is the core computation of tensor
   decomposition. Optimizing the computational performance of SpTV on
   CPU-GPU becomes a challenge due to the complexity of the non-zero
   element sparse distribution of the tensor. To solve this problem, we
   propose IAP-SpTV, an input aware adaptive pipeline SpTV via Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) on CPU-GPU. We first design the hybrid
   tensor format (HTF) and explore the challenges of the HTF-based Pipeline
   SpTV algorithm. Second, we construct Slice-GCN to overcome the challenge
   of selecting a suitable format for each slice of HTF. Third, we
   construct an IAP-SpTV performance model for pipelining to achieve the
   maximum overlap between transfer and computation time during pipelining.
   Finally, we conduct experiments on two CPU-GPU platforms of different
   architectures to verify the correctness, effectiveness, and portability
   of IAP-SpTV. Overall, IAP-SpTV provides a significant performance
   improvement of about 24.85% to 58.42% compared to the state-of-the-art

AB Incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) into recommender systems to provide
   explainable recommendation has attracted much attention recently. The
   multi-hop paths in KGs can provide auxiliary facts for improving
   recommendation performance as well as explainability. However, existing
   studies may suffer from two major challenges: error propagation and weak
   explainability. Considering all paths between every user-item pair might
   involve irrelevant ones, which leads to error propagation of user
   preferences. Defining meta-paths might alleviate the error propagation,
   but the recommendation performance would heavily depend on the
   pre-defined meta-paths. Some recent methods based on graph convolution
   network (GCN) achieve better recommendation performance, but fail to
   provide explainability. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel
   method named Knowledge-aware Reasoning with Graph Convolution Network
   (KR-GCN). Specifically, to alleviate the effect of error propagation, we
   design a transition-based method to determine the triple-level scores
   and utilize nucleus sampling to select triples within the paths between
   every user-item pair adaptively. To improve the recommendation
   performance and guarantee the diversity of explanations, user-item
   interactions and knowledge graphs are integrated into a heterogeneous
   graph, which is performed with the graph convolution network. A
   path-level self-attention mechanism is adopted to discriminate the
   contributions of different selected paths and predict the interaction
   probability, which improves the relevance of the final explanation.
   Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that
   KR-GCN consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. And
   human evaluation proves the superiority of KR-GCN on explainability.

   the composite (NSO-gCN), which is twice that in gCN, using
   triethanolamine (TEOA) and chlor-oplatinic acid (1% w/w) as holes
   scavenger and the precursor for the Pt cocatalyst, respectively. Such

AB Human motion prediction is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal
   feature modeling. Among all methods, graph convolution networks (GCNs)
   are extensively utilized because of their superiority in explicit
   connection modeling. Within a GCN, the graph correlation adjacency
   matrix drives feature aggregation, and thus, is the key to extracting
   predictive motion features. State-of-the-art methods decompose the
   spatiotemporal correlation into spatial correlations for each frame and
   temporal correlations for each joint. Directly parameterizing these
   correlations introduces redundant parameters to represent common
   relations shared by all frames and all joints. Besides, the
   spatiotemporal graph adjacency matrix is the same for different motion
   samples, and thus, cannot reflect samplewise correspondence variances.
   To overcome these two bottlenecks, we propose dynamic spatiotemporal
   decompose GC (DSTD-GC), which only takes 28.6% parameters of the
   state-of-the-art GC. The key of DSTD-GC is constrained dynamic
   correlation modeling, which explicitly parameterizes the common static
   constraints as a spatial/temporal vanilla adjacency matrix shared by all
   frames/joints and dynamically extracts correspondence variances for each
   frame/joint with an adjustment modeling function. For each sample, the
   common constrained adjacency matrices are fixed to represent generic
   motion patterns, while the extracted variances complete the matrices
   with specific pattern adjustments. Meanwhile, we mathematically
   reformulate GCs on spatiotemporal graphs into a unified form and find
   that DSTD-GC relaxes certain constraints of other GC, which contributes
   to a better representation capability. Moreover, by combining DSTDGC
   with prior knowledge like body connection and temporal context, we
   propose a powerful spatiotemporal GCN called DSTD-GCN. On the Human3.6M,
   Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Mocap, and 3D Poses in the Wild (3DPW)
   datasets, DSTD-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.9%-8.7% in
   prediction accuracy with 55.0%-96.9% fewer parameters. Codes are
   available at https://github.com/Jaakk0F/DSTD-GCN.

AB Most rumor detection methods extract the features of rumor through two
   aspects of text semantics and propagation structure to achieve automatic
   rumor classification, while most of the existing methods do not realize
   that false and irrelevant interactions in the propagation structure will
   reduce the accuracy of rumor detection. In addition, most of the
   existing rumor detection methods failed to effectively extract key clues
   from the comments of social network users. In response to these
   phenomena, this article proposes a social network rumor detection method
   combining a dual attention mechanism and graph convolutional network
   (GCN) (dual-attention GCN, DA-GCN). First, build an event propagation
   graph; then, the GCN is used to extract the propagation structure
   information of each event-related microblog (tweet), and the attention
   mechanism is combined to suppress the false and irrelevant interactive
   relationships. Therefore, the anti-interference propagation structure
   features are extracted from the propagation graph. Second, to fully
   utilize the clues in users' comments, this article makes use of the
   attention mechanism to fuse source microblog (tweet) with the
   comment-retweet information and extract interactive semantic features
   from it. Finally, the above two features are fused to generate a new
   event representation. Experimental results show that the proposed DA-GCN
   has an accuracy of 94.4%, 90.5%, and 90.2% on the Weibo dataset, the
   Twitter15 dataset, and the Twitter16 dataset, respectively, and has
   achieved excellent performance in the early rumor detection task, which
   proves that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.

AB Featured ApplicationProtein and peptide identification based on tandem
   mass spectrometry is a pillar technology in proteomics research. In
   recent years, increasing numbers of researchers have utilized deep
   learning to tackle challenges in proteomics. For example, catalyzed by
   deep learning, AlphaFold has achieved unparalleled levels of accuracy in
   protein-structure prediction. Prior to studying the structure and
   function of proteins in cells or tissues, it is essential to determine
   the sequences of amino acids in peptides or proteins. De novo peptide
   sequencing can be used to directly infer the peptide sequence from a
   tandem mass spectrum without the requirement for a reference sequence
   database, making it particularly suitable for the determination of
   protein sequences of unknown species, monoclonal antibodies, and cancer
   neoantigens.The de novo peptide-sequencing method can be used to
   directly infer the peptide sequence from a tandem mass spectrum. It has
   the advantage of not relying on protein databases and plays a key role
   in the determination of the protein sequences of unknown species,
   monoclonal antibodies, and cancer neoantigens. In this paper, we propose
   a method based on graph convolutional neural networks and convolutional
   neural networks, Denovo-GCN, for de novo peptide sequencing. We
   constructed an undirected graph based on the mass difference between the
   spectral peaks in a tandem mass spectrum. The features of the nodes on
   the spectrum graph, which represent the spectral peaks, were the
   matching information of the peptide sequence and the mass spectrum.
   Next, the Denovo-GCN used CNN to extract the features of the nodes. The
   correlation between the nodes was represented by an adjacency matrix,
   which aggregated the features of neighboring nodes. Denovo-GCN provides
   a complete end-to-end training and prediction framework to sequence
   patterns of peptides. Our experiments on various data sets from
   different species show that Denovo-GCN outperforms DeepNovo with a
   relative improvement of 13.7-25.5% in terms of the peptide-level recall.

AB Traffic prediction is an important part of intelligent transportation
   system. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) is introduced for
   traffic flow forecasting and achieves good performance due to its
   superiority of representing the graph traffic road structure network.
   Moreover, the dynamic GCN is put forward to model the temporal property
   of the traffic flow. Although great progress has been made, most GCN
   based traffic flow forecasting methods utilize a single graph for
   convolution, which is considered not enough to reveal the inherent
   property of traffic graph as it is influenced by many factors, for
   example weather, season and traffic accidents etc. In this paper, an
   exotic graph transformer based dynamic multiple graph convolution
   networks (GTDMGCN) is conceived for traffic flow forecasting. Instead of
   the single graph, multiple graphs are constructed to modulate the
   complex traffic network by the proposed graph transformer network.
   Additionally, a temporal gate convolution is proposed to get the
   temporal property of traffic flow. The proposed GTDMGCN model is
   evaluated on four real traffic datasets of PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07,
   PEMS08, and there are average increments of 9.78%, 7.80%, 5.96% under
   MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics compared with the current results.

AB Synthesis of 2D carbon-based layered structures materials is highly
   desirable for higher-photocatalytic activities. Here in this regard, we
   use commercially exhausted urea for the fabrication activated carbons
   and graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) layered structures doped with sulphur
   to accumulate activated carbon with S for pollutants degradation using
   the thermal decomposition method. The synthesized material contains
   activated carbon in a small amount, which does not accumulate with
   nitrogen to form GCN and cause a higher energy bandgap (3.31 eV - 3.38
   eV). However, through S, we have modified the bandgap and reduced it to
   (2.84 eV - 3.06 eV) for visible light. The S with activated carbon
   system along with GCN enhances the synergetic contribution in
   degradation. The reaction constant (K) is increased from (3.5 x 10-3 -
   4.1 x 10-2) owing to synergic effect. Most notably, a significant amount
   of sulphur accumulated with activated carbon and GCN, altered the charge
   transfer route and enhanced optical absorption and higher photocatalytic
   activity, and i considered a novel approach for environmental
   remediation.

AB Chemisorption is an effective method to remove Hg0 from coal-fired flue
   gas. During this process, Hg0 will convert to Hg2+ and be solidified on
   sorbent surface. The number of adsorption sites and the electron
   transfer between Hg0 and sorbents play an important role in the removal
   process. In the present work, GO with a rapid electron transfer was
   compounded with NS-g-C3N4 to improve the electron donating ability of
   NS-g-C3N4. After that, Co3O4 nanosheets were grown in-situ in the
   interlayer space of GO and NS-g-C3N4 composites. A series of sorbents
   were successfully synthesized by changing GO concentration. SEM and TEM
   results show that the corresponding Co3O4/GCN (GCN denote the GO and
   NS-g-C3N4 composites) sorbent has better Co3O4 nanosheet dispersibility
   when GO concentration is 5 mg/mL. This results in a large amount of
   chemisorbed oxygen, which is favor to the oxidation of Hg0 to HgO. In
   addition, XPS results show that the interaction between Co3O4 and GCN
   give a rapid electrons transfer from GCN to Co3O4, thus improving the
   activation of gaseous oxygen. Therefore, Co3O4/GCN-5 has excellent Hg0
   removal efficiency of about 95 % at 200 degrees C and high stability
   under different flue gas conditions. A probable reaction path way was
   deduced by the results of XPS and Hg0 adsorption-desorption experiment.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) is a promising n-type semiconductor
   widely investigated for photo-assisted water splitting, but less studied
   for the (photo)electrochemical degradation of aqueous organic
   pollutants. In these fields, attractive perspectives for advancements
   are offered by a proper engineering of the material properties, e.g., by
   depositing gCN onto conductive and porous scaffolds, tailoring its
   nanoscale morphology, and functionalizing it with suitable cocatalysts.
   The present study reports on a simple and easily controllable synthesis
   of gCN flakes on Ni foam substrates by electrophoretic deposition (EPD),
   and on their eventual decoration with Co-based cocatalysts [CoO,
   CoFe2O4, cobalt phosphate (CoPi)] via radio frequency (RF)-sputtering or
   electrodeposition. After examining the influence of processing
   conditions on the material characteristics, the developed systems are
   comparatively investigated as (photo)anodes for water splitting and
   photoelectrocatalysts for the degradation of a recalcitrant water
   pollutant [potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP)]. The obtained results
   highlight that while gCN decoration with Co-based cocatalysts boosts
   water splitting performances, bare gCN as such is more efficient in KHP
   abatement, due to the occurrence of a different reaction mechanism. The
   related insights, provided by a multi-technique characterization, may
   provide valuable guidelines for the implementation of active
   nanomaterials in environmental remediation and sustainable
   solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

AB IntroductionAlthough the method of visualizing eye-tracking data as a
   time-series might enhance performance in the understanding of gaze
   behavior, it has not yet been thoroughly examined in the context of
   rapid automated naming (RAN). MethodsThis study attempted, for the first
   time, to measure gaze behavior during RAN from the perspective of
   network-domain, which constructed a complex network [referred to as
   gaze-time-series-based complex network (GCN)] from gaze time-series.
   Hence, without designating regions of interest, the features of gaze
   behavior during RAN were extracted by computing topological parameters
   of GCN. A sample of 98 children (52 males, aged 11.50 +/- 0.28 years)
   was studied. Nine topological parameters (i.e., average degree, network
   diameter, characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, global
   efficiency, assortativity coefficient, modularity, community number, and
   small-worldness) were computed. ResultsFindings showed that GCN in each
   RAN task was assortative and possessed "small-world" and community
   architecture. Additionally, observations regarding the influence of RAN
   task types included that: (i) five topological parameters (i.e., average
   degree, clustering coefficient, assortativity coefficient, modularity,
   and community number) could reflect the difference between tasks N-num
   (i.e., naming of numbers) and N-cha (i.e., naming of Chinese
   characters); (ii) there was only one topological parameter (i.e.,
   network diameter) which could reflect the difference between tasks N-obj
   (i.e., naming of objects) and N-col (i.e., naming of colors); and (iii)
   when compared to GCN in alphanumeric RAN, GCN in non-alphanumeric RAN
   may have higher average degree, global efficiency, and small-worldness,
   but lower network diameter, characteristic path length, clustering
   coefficient, and modularity. Findings also illustrated that most of
   these topological parameters were largely independent of traditional
   eye-movement metrics. DiscussionThis article revealed the architecture
   and topological parameters of GCN as well as the influence of task types
   on them, and thus brought some new insights into the understanding of
   RAN from the perspective of complex network.

AB Background: There has been a growing interest in discovering a viable
   drug for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since the beginning of the
   pandemic. Protein-ligand interaction studies are a crucial step in the
   drug discovery process, as it helps us narrow the search space for
   potential ligands with high drug-likeness. Derivatives of popular drugs
   like Remdesivir generated through tools employing evolutionary
   algorithms are usually considered potential candidates. However,
   screening promising molecules from such a large search space is
   difficult. In a conventional screening process, for each ligand-target
   pair, there are time-consuming interaction studies that use docking
   simulations before downstream tasks like thermodynamic, kinetic, and
   electrostatic-potential evaluation.Objective :This work aims to build a
   model based on deep learning applied over the graph structure of the
   molecules to accelerate the screening process for novel potential
   candidates for SARS-CoV-2 by predicting the binding energy of the
   protein-ligand complex.Methods :In this work, 'Graph Convolutional
   Capsule Regression' (GCCR), a model which uses Capsule Neural Networks
   (CapsNet) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to predict the binding
   energy of a protein-ligand complex is being proposed. The model's
   predictions were further validated with kinetic and free energy studies
   like Molecular Dynamics (MD) for kinetic stability and MM/GBSA analysis
   for free energy calculations.Results :The GCCR showed an RMSE value of
   0.0978 for 81.3% of the concordance index. The RMSE of GCCR converged
   around the iteration of just 50 epochs scoring a lower RMSE than GCN and
   GAT. When training with Davis Dataset, GCCR gave an RMSE score of 0.3806
   with a CI score of 87.5%.Conclusion :The proposed GCCR model shows great
   potential in improving the screening process based on binding affinity
   and outperforms baseline machine learning models like DeepDTA, KronRLS,
   SimBoost, and other Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based models like Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

AB Unbalanced interaction relationships at personal and group levels play a
   pivotal role in collective activity recognition, which has not been
   adaptively and jointly explored by previous approaches. In this paper,
   we propose a graph attention interaction model (GAIM) embedded with the
   graph attention block (GAB) to explicitly and adaptively infer
   unbalanced interaction relations at personal and group levels in a
   unified architecture, and further to learn the spatial and temporal
   evolutions of the collective activity from these interactions to predict
   the activity labels. We first design the spatiotemporal graphs tailored
   to the collective activity where the concurrent person and group nodes,
   respectively, represent individuals' actions and the collective
   activity. The graphs provide both spatial structures and semantic
   appearance features for the collective activity. Then, GAB performs
   convolution-like filters on the graphs to infer unequal and two-level
   interaction relations in the collective activity by implementing graph
   convolutional networks with a shared attention mechanism. At the
   personal level, the GAB learns different levels of interactions for each
   person node from its neighbor person nodes under the guidance from the
   group node. At the group level, the GAB assesses various degrees of
   interactions to the group node contributed by person nodes. Equipped
   with the GRUs network, the GAIM learns the spatial and temporal
   evolutions of individuals' actions as well as the collective activity
   from the captured interactions, and finally predicts the label of the
   collective activity. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and
   ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of our GAIM,

AB Disease prediction is a well-known classification problem in medical
   applications. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) provide a powerful
   tool for analyzing the patients' features relative to each other. This
   can be achieved by modeling the problem as a graph node classification
   task, where each node is a patient. Due to the nature of such medical
   datasets, class imbalance is a prevalent issue in the field of disease
   prediction, where the distribution of classes is skewed. When the class
   imbalance is present in the data, the existing graph-based classifiers
   tend to be biased towards the major class(es) and neglect the samples in
   the minor class(es). On the other hand, the correct diagnosis of the
   rare positive cases (true-positives) among all the patients is vital in
   a healthcare system. In conventional methods, such imbalance is tackled
   by assigning appropriate weights to classes in the loss function which
   is still dependent on the relative values of weights, sensitive to
   outliers, and in some cases biased towards the minor class(es). In this
   paper, we propose a Re-weighted Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network
   (RA-GCN) to prevent the graph-based classifier from emphasizing the
   samples of any particular class. This is accomplished by associating a
   graph-based neural network to each class, which is responsible for
   weighting the class samples and changing the importance of each sample
   for the classifier. Therefore, the classifier adjusts itself and
   determines the boundary between classes with more attention to the
   important samples. The parameters of the classifier and weighting
   networks are trained by an adversarial approach. We show experiments on
   synthetic and three publicly available medical datasets. Our results
   demonstrate the superiority of RA-GCN compared to recent methods in
   identifying the patient's status on all three datasets. The detailed
   analysis of our method is provided as quantitative and qualitative
   experiments on synthetic datasets. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Due to the cost and complexity of biological experiments, many
   computational methods have been proposed to predict potential
   miRNA-disease associations by utilizing known miRNA-disease associations
   and other related information. However, there are some challenges for
   these computational methods. First, the relationships between miRNAs and
   diseases are complex. The computational network should consider the
   local and global influence of neighborhoods from the network.
   Furthermore, predicting disease-related miRNAs without any known
   associations is also very important. This study presents a new
   computational method that constructs a heterogeneous network composed of
   a miRNA similarity network, disease similarity network, and known
   miRNA-disease association network. The miRNA similarity considers the
   miRNAs and their possible families and clusters. The information of each
   node in heterogeneous network is obtained by aggregating neighborhood
   information with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which can pass the
   information of a node to its intermediate and distant neighbors.
   Disease-related miRNAs with no known associations can be predicted with
   the reconstructed heterogeneous matrix. We apply 5-fold
   cross-validation, leave-one-disease-out cross-validation, and global and
   local leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate our method. The
   corresponding areas under the curves (AUCs) are 0.9616, 0.9946, 0.9656,
   and 0.9532, confirming that our approach significantly outperforms the
   state-of-the-art methods. Case studies show that this approach can
   effectively predict new diseases without any known miRNAs.

AB Network embedding has been an effective tool to analyze heterogeneous
   networks (HNs) by representing nodes in a low-dimensional space.
   Although many recent methods have been proposed for representation
   learning of HNs, there is still much room for improvement. Random walks
   based methods are currently popular methods to learn network embedding;
   however, they are random and limited by the length of sampled walks, and
   have difficulty capturing network structural information. Some recent
   researches proposed using meta paths to express the sample relationship
   in HNs. Another popular graph learning model, the graph convolutional
   network (GCN) is known to be capable of better exploitation of network
   topology, but the current design of GCN is intended for homogenous
   networks. This paper proposes a novel combination of meta-graph and
   graph convolution, the meta-graph based graph convolutional networks
   (MGCN). To fully capture the complex long semantic information, MGCN
   utilizes different meta-graphs in HNs. As different meta-graphs express
   different semantic relationships, MGCN learns the weights of different
   meta-graphs to make up for the loss of semantics when applying GCN. In
   addition, we improve the current convolution design by adding node
   self-significance. To validate our model in learning feature
   representation, we present comprehensive experiments on four real-world
   datasets and two representation tasks: classification and link
   prediction. WMGCN's representations can improve accuracy scores by up to
   around 10% in comparison to other popular representation learning
   models. What's more, WMGCN'feature learning outperforms other popular
   baselines. The experimental results clearly show our model is superior
   over other state-of-the-art representation learning algorithms.

AB Due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of the gene expression
   matrix in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, coupled with
   significant noise generated by shallow sequencing, it poses a great
   challenge for cell clustering methods. While numerous computational
   methods have been proposed, the majority of existing approaches center
   on processing the target dataset itself. This approach disregards the
   wealth of knowledge present within other species and batches of
   scRNA-seq data. In light of this, our paper proposes a novel method
   named graph-based deep embedding clustering (GDEC) that leverages
   transfer learning across species and batches. GDEC integrates graph
   convolutional networks, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by
   sparse gene expression matrices. Additionally, the incorporation of DEC
   in GDEC enables the partitioning of cell clusters within a
   lower-dimensional space, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of noise
   on clustering outcomes. GDEC constructs a model based on existing
   scRNA-seq datasets and then applying transfer learning techniques to
   fine-tune the model using a limited amount of prior knowledge gleaned
   from the target dataset. This empowers GDEC to adeptly cluster scRNA-seq
   data cross different species and batches. Through cross-species and
   cross-batch clustering experiments, we conducted a comparative analysis
   between GDEC and conventional packages. Furthermore, we implemented GDEC
   on the scRNA-seq data of uterine fibroids. Compared results obtained
   from the Seurat package, GDEC unveiled a novel cell type (epithelial
   cells) and identified a notable number of new pathways among various
   cell types, thus underscoring the enhanced analytical capabilities of
   GDEC.Availability and implementation:

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has been demonstrated to be a potential
   visible-light-driven photocatalyst for eliminating organic pollutants.
   However, its practical application is limited by low photocatalytic
   effi-ciency originating from high recombination of photogenerated
   charges. In this work, the electronic struc-ture of GCN was regulated by
   doping aminobenzaldehyde (ABA) into the skeleton through a solid-state
   Schiff base reaction. Photoelectrochemical characterizations illustrated
   that the obtained catalyst (CNABA) exhibited narrower band gap, lower
   recombination rate of photoinduced electron-hole pair and higher charge
   transfer ability than the pristine GCN, further indicating its excellent
   photocatalytic activity. Using moxifloxacin (MOX) as a model pollutant,
   the ABA doping content was firstly optimized and the optimal activity of
   the CNABA photocatalyst was 3.1 times higher than that of the GCN.
   Subsequently, the effects of pH value, photocatalyst dosage and MOX
   concentration on the photocatalytic behavior were also studied. Superior
   stability and photocatalytic reusability were confirmed by five repeated
   tests. By substituting tap water/natural lake water for deionized water
   and sunlight for xenon light, the CNABA also exhibited high elimination
   efficiency, implying its good practicability. Superoxide radical,
   hydroxyl radical and photogenerated hole were identified as the main
   active species to degrade MOX. Finally, possible degradation pathways
   for MOX to mineralize small molecules were proposed by determining
   intermediate products during photocatalysis. This work provides a
   solid-state method to rationally design aromatic system-modified GCN
   photocatalysts, and the obtained CNABA is a promising
   visible-light-driven photocatalyst for eliminating antibiotics.(c) 2022

   network model - DeepPROTACs to help design potent PROTACs molecules. It
   can predict the degradation capacity of a proposed PROTAC molecule based
   on structures of given target protein and E3 ligase. The experimental
   dataset is mainly collected from PROTAC-DB and appropriately labeled
   according to the DC50 and Dmax values. In the model of DeepPROTACs, the
   ligands as well as the ligand binding pockets are generated and
   represented with graphs and fed into Graph Convolutional Networks for
   feature extraction. While SMILES representations of linkers are fed into
   a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory layer to generate the features.
   Experiments show that DeepPROTACs model achieves 77.95% average

AB As a fine-grained and challenging subtask in the natural language
   processing (NLP) community, aspectbased sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims
   to predict the sentiment polarity towards a given aspect term. In
   previous ABSA research, most works utilized the pre-trained language
   model (PLM) as the backbone of their proposed methods, without any
   specific task-related instructions. Besides, some works focused on
   learning the dependency information or the external knowledge-enhanced
   dependency information separately, which lacked the exploitation of the
   mutual interaction between the normal dependency and knowledge-enhanced
   dependency. Therefore, we propose a novel ABSA method namely prompted
   representation joint contrastive learning enhanced graph convolutional
   networks (PRCL-GCN) to strengthen the robustness of the ABSA model.
   Specifically, to achieve the task-oriented contextual representation, we
   design the task-specific prompt template to guide the fine-tuning
   process of PLM in the ABSA task. And a biaffine attention mechanism is
   employed to further extract the essential sentiment feature from the
   prompted representation. Moreover, we introduce the syntax dependency
   graph as prior knowledge, and construct an affective syntactic
   dependency graph by injecting the affective knowledge from SenticNet
   into the graph. Then, we utilize the multi-layer GCNs to process the
   above two syntactic graphs independently, which aims to learn
   multi-granularity syntactic features. Subsequently, a novel designed
   attention variant is leveraged to integrate these syntax features with
   the guided contextual representation, separately. Eventually, through
   designing a Kullback-Leibler divergencebased contrastive learning to
   encourage the model's learning, we improve the model's accuracy in
   modeling contextual representation by integrating the designed dual-ways
   information. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark
   datasets, and the outstanding experiment results validate the
   effectiveness of our proposed model.

AB The diagnosis of chest diseases is a challenging task for assessing
   thousands of radiology subjects. Their diagnosis decisions heavily rely
   on the expert radiologists' manual annotations. It is important to
   develop automated analysis methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of
   chest diseases on chest radiography. To explore the label relationship
   and improve the diagnosis performance, we present an end-to-end
   multi-label learning framework for jointly modeling the global and local
   label correlation, called GL-MLL that (1) explores the label correlation
   from a globally static view and a locally adaptive view, (2) considers
   the imbalanced class distribution, and (3) focuses on capturing
   label-specific features in image-level representation. We validate the
   performance of the proposed framework on the CheXpert dataset. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed GL-MLL outperforms
   state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
   representation learning. Nevertheless, the recent work indicates that
   current GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, in particular
   structural perturbations. This, therefore, narrows the application of
   GNN models in real-world scenarios. Such vulnerability can be attributed
   to the model's excessive reliance on incomplete data views (e.g., graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) heavily rely on graph structures to make
   predictions). By integrating the information from multiple perspectives,
   this problem can be effectively addressed, and typical views of graphs
   include the node feature view and the graph structure view. In this
   paper, we propose C(2)oG, which combines these two typical views to
   train sub-models and fuses their knowledge through co-training. Due to
   the orthogonality of the views, sub-models in the feature view tend to
   be robust against the perturbations targeted at sub-models in the
   structure view. C(2)oG allows sub-models to correct one another mutually
   and thus enhance the robustness of their ensembles. In our evaluations,
   C(2)oG significantly improves the robustness of graph models against
   adversarial attacks without sacrificing their performance on clean
   datasets.

AB Randomized neural networks (NNs), such as random vector functional link
   (RVFL) and extreme learning machine (ELM), have been widely applied in
   various classification problems owing to their computational efficiency
   and universal approximation capability. However, such approaches are
   designed for regular Euclidean data and lack the ability to generalize
   to complex structured data. Moreover, their randomly generated
   parameters often lead to a suboptimal decision boundary with a growing
   requirement of hidden neurons. In this article, we first propose a plain
   framework, termed randomized graph convolutional networks (RGCNs), to
   generalize the classic randomized NNs to the non-Euclidean domain. Then,
   a hybrid framework called evolution-driven RGCN (EvoRGCN) is presented
   by using adaptive differential evolution with novelty search strategy to
   seek the globally optimal graph embedding for the plain RGCN. Finally,
   we recast the classic ELM and RVFL under the proposed frameworks,
   resulting in four novel semi-supervised models, including the plain
   models [i.e., graph convolutional extreme learning machines (GCELMs) and
   graph convolutional RVFL (GCRVFL)] and the optimized models (i.e.,
   O-GCELM and O-GCRVFL). We show that our approaches are the natural
   generalization of the traditional randomized NNs in the non-Euclidean
   domain. Furthermore, our approaches not only retain the advantages of
   the classic approaches but also enable them to handle graph data. We
   compare our approaches against many existing methods across regular
   datasets and graph benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed
   approaches dramatically outperform the compared methods with better
   generalization ability and robustness. Particularly, we quantitatively
   show the performance ranking of different randomized NNs, i.e., O-GCRVFL
   > O-GCELM approximate to GCRVFL > GCELM approximate to RVFL > ELM.

AB In this study, we propose a new approach for automatically generating
   high-quality non-uniform meshes based on supervised learning. The
   proposed framework, GMR-Net, is based on training a graph convolutional
   neural network (GCN) that learns local error density around each
   interior vertex in the mesh. The target edge length is then estimated
   using the predicted local error density. GMR-Net performs vertex-based
   error estimation as a preprocessing step to avoid expensive error
   estimation. The proposed GCN-based neural net has new input features for
   learning the local error density with various polygonal geometries, a
   range of partial differential equation parameters, and boundary
   conditions. During the test process, it predicts the target edge length
   around each interior vertex for the coarse input mesh, and the final
   non-uniform meshes are generated over the domain using Gmsh. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the GMR-Net, we tested the GMR-Net on
   Poisson's equations and linear elasticity problems to previously unseen
   and new polygonal geometries and a range of PDE coefficients and
   boundary conditions.

AB Entity alignment refers to matching entities with the same realistic
   meaning in different knowledge graphs. The structure of a knowledge
   graph provides the global signal for entity alignment. But in the real
   world, a knowledge graph provides insufficient structural information in
   general. Moreover, the problem of knowledge graph heterogeneity is
   common. The semantic and string information can alleviate the problems
   caused by the sparse and heterogeneous nature of knowledge graphs, yet
   both of them have not been fully utilized by most existing work.
   Therefore, we propose an entity alignment model based on multiple
   information (EAMI), which employs structural, semantic and string
   information. EAMI learns the structural representation of a knowledge
   graph by using multi-layer graph convolutional networks. To acquire more
   accurate entity vector representation, we incorporate the attribute
   semantic representation into the structural representation. In addition,
   to further improve entity alignment, we study the entity name string
   information. There is no training required to calculate the similarity
   of entity names. Our model is tested on publicly available cross-lingual
   datasets and cross-resource datasets, and the experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Transformer has been widely used in classification tasks for
   hyperspectral images (HSIs) in recent years. Because it can mine
   spectral sequence information to establish long-range dependence, its
   classification performance can be comparable with the convolutional
   neural network (CNN). However, both CNN and Transformer focus
   excessively on spatial or spectral domain features, resulting in an
   insufficient combination of spatial-spectral domain information from HSI
   for modeling. To solve this problem, we propose a new end-to-end graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and Transformer fusion network (GTFN) with
   the spatial-spectral feature extraction in this article, which combines
   the strengths of GCN and Transformer in both spatial and spectral domain
   feature extraction, taking full advantage of the contextual information
   of classified pixels while establishing remote dependencies in the
   spectral domain compared with previous approaches. In addition, GTFN
   uses Follow Patch as an input to the GCN and effectively solves the
   problem of high model complexity while mining the relationship between
   pixels. It is worth noting that the spectral attention module is
   introduced in the process of GCN feature extraction, focusing on the
   contribution of different spectral bands to the classification. More
   importantly, to overcome the problem that Transformer is too scattered
   in the frequency domain feature extraction, a neighborhood convolution
   module is designed to fuse the local spectral domain features. On Indian
   Pines, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets, the overall accuracies
   (OAs) of our GTFN are 94.00%, 96.81%, and 95.14%, respectively. The core
   code of GTFN is released at https://github.com/1useryang/GTFN.

AB Stock prices movement prediction has been a longstanding research topic.
   Many studies have introduced several kinds of external information like
   relations of stocks, combined with internal information of trading
   characteristics to promote forecasting. Different from previous cases,
   this article proposes a reasonable assumption that major fluctuations of
   stock prices are mainly triggered by high-volume transactions which
   usually occur on a group of stocks that share some common features
   (e.g., stocks in the same industry, region, concept or yield similar
   volatility), and further develops an integrated GCN-LSTM method to
   achieve more precise predictions from the perspective of modelling
   capital flows. First, we construct four kinds of graphs incorporating
   various relational knowledge (edge) and utilize graph convolutional
   network (GCN) to extract stock (node) embeddings in multiple
   time-periods. Then, the obtained temporal sequences of stock embeddings
   are put into long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to
   discriminate the moving direction of prices. Extensive experiments on
   major Chinese stock indexes have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
   model with best accuracy of 57.81% acquired, which is much better than
   baselines. Moreover, experimental results of GCN-LSTM under different
   graphs and various node embedding dimensions have been compared and
   analyzed, indicating the selection of key parameters to achieve optimal
   performances. Our research findings provide an improved model to
   forecast stock prices movement directions with a reliable theoretical
   interpretation, and in depth exhibit insights for further applications
   of graph neural networks and graph data in business analytics,
   quantitative finance, and risk management decision-makings.

AB Influence maximization is an important technique for its significant
   value on various social network applications, such as viral marketing,
   advertisement, and recommendation. Traditional heuristic algorithms for
   influence maximization suffer from different issues, such as accuracy
   descent and information loss during network exploration. Besides,
   recently proposed deep learning-based approaches cannot extract the
   in-depth structural information of social networks well. In light of
   these problems, we propose a novel heuristic method called the network
   dynamic GCN influence maximization algorithm based on the leader fake
   labeling mechanism. To exploit the in-depth network topology information
   for the influence maximization task, we design a network dynamic GCN
   that owns adaptive layer numbers in terms of different network scales to
   obtain node representations. Then, considering that there are few labels
   in the network or the labels are irrelevant to the task of influence
   maximization, we establish a leader fake labeling mechanism to
   automatically generate node labels that are helpful to seed nodes
   selecting for model training. Finally, a heuristic method based on the
   Mahalanobis distance is developed to quickly select influential seed
   nodes with the learned node representations. Three real-world datasets
   are used in our experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate
   that our algorithm has a better performance for seed set identification
   under the premise of high efficiency compared with some latest heuristic
   influence maximization algorithms.

AB Skeleton-based human action cognition (HAR) has drawn increasing
   attention recently. As an emerging approach for skeleton-based HAR
   tasks, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) achieves
   remarkable performance by fully exploiting the skeleton topology
   information via graph convolution. Unfortunately, existing GCN
   accelerators lose efficiency when processing STGCN models due to two
   limitations. (1) At the dataflow level, the hardware parallelism of GCN
   accelerators cannot match the computation parallelism of STGCN models,
   leading to computing resource under-utilization. (2) At the computation
   level, GCN accelerators fail to exploit the inherent temporal redundancy
   in STGCN models. To overcome the limitations, this paper proposes STAR,
   an STGCN architecture for skeleton-based human action recognition. STAR
   is designed based on the characteristics of different computation phases
   in STGCN. For limitation (1), a spatial-temporal dimension consistent
   (STDC) dataflow is proposed to fully exploit the data reuse
   opportunities in all the different dimensions of STGCN. For limitation
   (2), we propose a node-wise exponent sharing scheme and a
   temporal-structured redundancy elimination mechanism, to exploit the
   inherent temporal redundancy specially introduced by STGCN. To further
   address the under-utilization induced by redundancy elimination, we
   design a dynamic data scheduler to manage the feature data storage and
   schedule the features and weights for valid computation in real time.
   STAR achieves 4.48x, 5.98x, 2.54x, and 103.88x energy savings on average
   over the HyGCN, AWB-GCN, TPU, and Jetson TX2 GPU.

AB To explore an efficient strategy for intelligent bedrock mapping that
   can be applied in the areas with coexisting Quaternary coverages and
   bedrock outcrops, a graph convolutional network (GCN) was implemented
   for bedrock classification using stream sediment geochemical samplings
   in the Chahanwusu River area, Qinghai Province, China. The sampling
   points were organized into a terrain weighted directed graph (TWDG)
   using Delaunay triangulation to capture the upstream-downstream
   relationships among the geochemical sampling points. The experimental
   results indicate that the semi-supervised GCN models, only using 20% of
   the labeled sampling points, achieved accuracies of 68.20% and 78.31% in
   ten-type and five-type bedrock discrimination, respectively. In
   conclusion, it is feasible to map the bedrock type through the
   concentrations of elements on the stream sediment geochemical sampling
   points. The proposed data-driven GCN bedrock classification method not
   only improves the efficiency of bedrock mapping but also may be applied
   in a large area.

AB This study proposes a hybrid deep learning approach for dynamic attitude
   and position prediction of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) with high
   accuracy. By utilizing the key operational parameters as well as the
   historical value of TBM's positions, the proposed deep learning model
   with graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory
   (LSTM), named GCN-LSTM, is constructed and trained to predict the
   vertical and horizontal deviations at the articulation and tail of TBM.
   Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is then performed to
   improve the model's interpretability and determine the key contributing
   factors. Data obtained from a realistic tunnel project in Singapore's
   Thomson-East Coast line is utilized as a case study. The results
   indicate that: (1) The proposed GCN-LSTM approach provides accurate
   prediction with an average MAE of 1.009 mm, RMSE of 1.445 mm and R2 of
   0.941. (2) The historical values of the deviation and adjustment are the
   major contributions to the current deviations, while the present
   adjustment could only influence the deviation in the future. (3) The
   pro-posed GCN-LSTM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
   most metrics for the four outputs and thus is the most suitable method
   for the prediction. The proposed approach provides a reliable estimation
   of TBM's position which assists in improving the overall project quality
   and reduces the risk of tunnel misalignments.

AB Herein, a 3D/2D/2D of a-Fe2O3/r-GO/GCN composites were synthesized by
   combined reflux condensation and sonochemical-assisted wet-impregnation
   techniques. The physicochemical properties of the prepared materials
   were inspected by various analytical techniques. Morphology analysis
   techniques of different electron micro-scopes were employed to confirm
   the rhombohedral (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) sheets' morphology. The
   electrochemical behaviour of the as-synthesised electrode materials was
   assessed for use in a redox electrolyte -based energy storage system.
   Electrochemical measurements in a 6M KOH solution revealed that the
   electrode exhibited good supercapacitive behaviour. The
   3D/2D/2D-a-Fe2O3/r-GO/GCN composite had a higher capac-itance rate of

   stability, ternary composite has good cyclic retention (98.9%) after

AB Single-view 3D human pose estimation (HPE) based on Graph Convolutional
   Networks currently suffers from problems such as insufficient feature
   representation and depth ambiguity. To address these issues, this letter
   proposes a hierarchical spatial-temporal adaptive graph fusion framework
   to improve monocular 3D HPE performance. Firstly, to enhance the spatial
   semantic feature representation of human nodes, a progressive adaptive
   graph feature capture strategy is developed, which adaptively constructs
   global-to-local attention graph features of all human joints in a
   coarse-to-fine manner. A spatial-temporal attention fusion module is
   then constructed to model long-term sequential dependencies and mitigate
   depth ambiguity. The temporal attention factors of related frames are
   captured and utilized to intermediately supervise the joint depth. The
   spatial semantic information among all joints in the same frame and
   temporal contextual knowledge of the joints across relevant frames are
   fused to build spatial-temporal correlations and optimize the final
   features. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks show that our
   method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches and improves 3D
   HPE performance.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have well-documented performance in
   various graph learning tasks, but their analysis is still at its
   infancy. Graph scattering transforms (GSTs) offer training-free deep GCN
   models that extract features from graph data, and are amenable to
   generalization and stability analyses. The price paid by GSTs is
   exponential complexity in space and time that increases with the number
   of layers. This discourages deployment of GSTs when a deep architecture
   is needed. The present work addresses the complexity limitation of GSTs
   by introducing an efficient so-termed pruned (p)GST approach. The
   resultant pruning algorithm is guided by a graph-spectrum-inspired
   criterion, and retains informative scattering features on-the-fly while
   bypassing the exponential complexity associated with GSTs. Stability of
   the novel pGSTs is also established when the input graph data or the
   network structure are perturbed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of pGST to
   random and localized signal perturbations is investigated analytically
   and experimentally. Numerical tests showcase that pGST performs
   comparably to the baseline GST at considerable computational savings.
   Furthermore, pGST achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art
   GCNs in graph and 3D point cloud classification tasks. Upon analyzing
   the pGST pruning patterns, it is shown that graph data in different
   domains call for different network architectures, and that the pruning
   algorithm may be employed to guide the design choices for contemporary
   GCNs.

AB In graph-structured data, the node content contains rich information.
   Therefore, how to effectively utilize the content is crucial to improve
   the performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on various
   analytical tasks. However, current GCNs do not fully utilize the
   content, especially multi-order content. For example, graph attention
   networks (GATs) only focus on low-order content, while high-order
   content is completely ignored. To address this issue, we propose a novel
   graph attention network with adaptability that could fully utilize the
   features of multi-order content. Its core idea has the following
   novelties: First, we constructed a high-order content attention
   mechanism that could focus on high-order content to evaluate attention
   weights. Second, we propose a multi-order content attention mechanism
   that can fully utilize multi-order content, i.e., it combines the
   attention mechanisms of high- and low-order content. Furthermore, the
   mechanism has adaptability, i.e., it can perform a good trade-off
   between high- and low-order content according to the task requirements.
   Lastly, we applied this mechanism to constructing a graph attention
   network with structural symmetry. This mechanism could more reasonably
   evaluate the attention weights between nodes, thereby improving the
   convergence of the network. In addition, we conducted experiments on
   multiple datasets and compared the proposed model with state-of-the-art
   models in multiple dimensions. The results validate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB Social influence prediction has permeated many domains, including
   marketing, behavior prediction, recommendation systems, and more.
   However, traditional methods of predicting social influence not only
   require domain expertise, they also rely on extracting user features,
   which can be very tedious. Additionally, graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs), which deals with graph data in non-Euclidean space, are not
   directly applicable to Euclidean space. To overcome these problems, we
   extended DeepInf such that it can predict the social influence of
   COVID-19 via the transition probability of the page rank domain.
   Furthermore, our implementation gives rise to a deep learning-based
   personalized propagation algorithm, called DeepPP. The resulting
   algorithm combines the personalized propagation of a neural prediction
   model with the approximate personalized propagation of a neural
   prediction model from page rank analysis. Four social networks from
   different domains as well as two COVID-19 datasets were used to analyze
   the proposed algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness. Compared to other
   baseline methods, DeepPP provides more accurate social influence
   predictions. Further, experiments demonstrate that DeepPP can be applied
   to real-world prediction data for COVID-19.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition can achieve a relatively high
   performance by transforming the human skeleton structure in an image
   into a graph and applying action recognition based on structural changes
   in the body. Among the many graph convolutional network (GCN) approaches
   used in skeleton-based action recognition, semantic-guided neural
   networks (SGNs) are fast action recognition algorithms that
   hierarchically learn spatial and temporal features by applying a GCN.
   However, because an SGN focuses on global feature learning rather than
   local feature learning owing to the structural characteristics, there is
   a limit to an action recognition in which the dependency between
   neighbouring nodes is important. To solve these problems and
   simultaneously achieve a real-time action recognition in low-end
   devices, in this study, a single head attention (SHA) that can overcome
   the limitations of an SGN is proposed, and a new SGN-SHA model that
   combines SHA with an SGN is presented. In experiments on various action
   recognition benchmark datasets, the proposed SGN-SHA model significantly
   reduced the computational complexity while exhibiting a performance
   similar to that of an existing SGN and other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one common developmental disorder with
   great variations in symptoms and severity, making the diagnosis of ASD a
   challenging task. Existing deep learning models using brain connectivity
   features to classify ASD still suffer from degraded performance for
   multi-center data due to limited feature representation ability and
   insufficient interpretability. Given that Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) has demonstrated superiority in learning discriminative
   representations of brain connectivity networks, in this paper, we
   propose an invertible dynamic GCN model to identify ASD and investigate
   the alterations of connectivity patterns associated with the disease. In
   order to select explainable features from the model, invertible blocks
   are introduced in the whole network, and we are able to reconstruct the
   input dynamic features from the network's output. A pre-screening of
   connectivity features is adopted to reduce the redundancy of the input
   information, and a fully-connected layer is added to perform
   classification. The experimental results on 867 subjects show that our
   proposed method achieves superior disease classification performance. It
   provides an interpretable deep learning model for brain connectivity
   analysis and is of great potential in studying brain-related disorders.

AB Traditional convolution neural networks have achieved great success in
   human action recognition. However, it is challenging to establish
   effective associations between different human bone nodes to capture
   detailed information. In this paper, we propose a dual attention-guided
   multiscale dynamic aggregate graph convolution neural network (DAG-GCN)
   for skeleton-based human action recognition. Our goal is to explore the
   best correlation and determine high-level semantic features. First, a
   multiscale dynamic aggregate GCN module is used to capture important
   semantic information and to establish dependence relationships for
   different bone nodes. Second, the higher level semantic feature is
   further refined, and the semantic relevance is emphasized through a dual
   attention guidance module. In addition, we exploit the relationship of
   joints hierarchically and the spatial temporal correlations through two
   modules. Experiments with the DAG-GCN method result in good performance
   on the NTU-60-RGB+D and NTU-120-RGB+D datasets. The accuracy is 95.76%
   and 90.01%, respectively, for the cross (X)-View and X-Subon the

AB As skeleton data becomes increasingly available, Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCNs) are popularly adapted to extract the spatial and
   temporal features for skeleton-based action recognition. However, there
   are still limitations to be addressed in GCN-based methods. First, the
   multi-level semantic features fail to be connected, making fine-grained
   information loss as the network deepens. Second, the cross-scale
   spatiotempral features fail to be simultaneously considered and refined
   to focus on informative areas. These limitations lead to the challenge
   in distinguishing the confusing actions. To address these issues, we
   propose a cross-scale connection (CSC) structure and a spatiotemporal
   refinement focus (STRF) module. The CSC aims to bridge the gap between
   multi-level semantic features. The STRF module refines the cross-scale
   spatiotemporal features to focus on informative joints in each frame.
   Both are embedded into the standard GCNs to form the cross-scale
   spatiotemporal refinement network (CSR-Net). Our proposed CSR-Net
   explicitly models the cross-scale spatiotemporal information among
   multi-level semantic representations to boost the distinguishing
   capability for ambiguous actions. We conduct extensive experiments to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and it outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA
   datasets.

AB Deep neural networks, especially graph neural networks, have made great
   progress in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Knowledge graphs can
   provide rich auxiliary information for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   However, existing models cannot effectively learn aspect-specific
   sentiment features from the review text and external knowledge. They
   cannot accurately select knowledge entities that are highly relevant to
   the aspect. They also ignore the semantic interaction between the review
   text and external knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a
   knowledge-enhanced interactive graph convolutional network (KE-IGCN).
   First, we introduce a subgraph construction strategy to construct a
   syntax-guided knowledge subgraph, which can guide KE-IGCN in selecting
   highly relevant knowledge entities. Second, we propose a knowledge
   interaction mechanism to exploit the semantic interaction between
   external knowledge and the review text. We then use multilayer graph
   convolutional networks to learn aspect-specific sentiment features from
   the review text and external knowledge jointly and interactively. We
   also use a multilevel feature fusion mechanism to aggregate
   aspect-specific sentiment features from semantic and syntactic
   information of the review and external knowledge. Experimental results
   on four public datasets demonstrate that KE-IGCN outperforms other
   state-of-the-art baseline models.

AB Hand gesture recognition methods play an important role in
   human-computer interaction. Among these methods are skeleton-based
   recognition techniques that seem to be promising. In literature, several
   methods have been proposed to recognize hand gestures with skeletons.
   One problem with these methods is that they consider little the
   connectivity between the joints of a skeleton, constructing simple
   graphs for skeleton connectivity. Observing this, we built a new model
   of hand skeletons by adding three types of edges in the graph to finely
   describe the linkage action of joints. Then, an end-to-end deep neural
   network, hand gesture graph convolutional network, is presented in which
   the convolution is conducted only on linked skeleton joints. Since the
   training dataset is relatively small, this work proposes expanding the
   coordinate dimensionality so as to let models learn more semantic
   features. Furthermore, relative coordinates are employed to help hand
   gesture graph convolutional network learn the feature representation
   independent of the random starting positions of actions. The proposed
   method is validated on two challenging datasets, and the experimental
   results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
   Furthermore, it is relatively lightweight in practice for hand
   skeleton-based gesture recognition.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which extend convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs) to non-Euclidean structures, have been utilized to
   promote skeleton-based human action recognition research and have made
   substantial progress in doing so. However, there are still some
   challenges in the construction of recognition models based on GCNs. In
   this paper, we propose an enhanced adjacency matrix-based graph
   convolutional network with a combinatorial attention mechanism
   (CA-EAMGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. Firstly, an enhanced
   adjacency matrix is constructed to expand the model's perceptive field
   of global node features. Secondly, a feature selection fusion module
   (FSFM) is designed to provide an optimal fusion ratio for multiple input
   features of the model. Finally, a combinatorial attention mechanism is
   devised. Specifically, our spatial-temporal (ST) attention module and
   limb attention module (LAM) are integrated into a multi-input branch and
   a mainstream network of the proposed model, respectively. Extensive
   experiments on three large-scale datasets, namely the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU
   RGB+D 120 and UAV-Human datasets, show that the proposed model takes
   into account both requirements of light weight and recognition accuracy.
   This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

   task that has a wide range of applications, from video surveillance to

   trajectories, an attention-based interaction-aware spatio-temporal graph
   neural network is introduced. This paper introduces an approach based on
   two components: a spatial graph neural network (SGNN) for
   interaction-modeling and a temporal graph neural network (TGNN) for
   motion feature extraction. The SGNN uses an attention method to
   periodically collect spatial interactions between all pedestrians. The
   TGNN employs an attention method as well, this time to collect each
   pedestrian's temporal motion pattern. Finally, in the graph's temporal
   dimension characteristics, a time-extrapolator convolutional neural
   network (CNN) is employed to predict the trajectories. Using a lower
   variable size (data and model) and a better accuracy, the proposed
   method is compact, efficient, and better than the one represented by the
   social-STGCNN. Moreover, using three video surveillance datasets (ETH,
   UCY, and SDD), D-STGCN achieves better experimental results considering
   the average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE)
   metrics, in addition to predicting more social trajectories.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) which models the potential
   relationship between non-Euclidean spatial data has attracted
   researchers' attention in deep learning in recent years. It has been
   widely used in different computer vision tasks by modeling the latent
   space, topology, semantics, and other information in Euclidean spatial
   data and has achieved significant success. To better understand the work
   principles and future GCN applications in the computer vision field,
   this study reviewed the basic principles of GCN, summarized the
   difficulties and solutions using GCN in different visual tasks, and
   introduced in detail the methods for constructing graphs from the
   Euclidean spatial data in different visual tasks. At the same time, the
   review divided the application of GCN in basic visual tasks into image
   recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance
   segmentation and object tracking. The role and performance of GCN in
   basic visual tasks were summarized and compared in detail for different
   tasks. This review emphasizes that the application of GCN in computer
   vision faces three challenges: computational complexity, the paradigm of
   constructing graphs from the Euclidean spatial data, and the
   interpretability of the model. Finally, this review proposes two future
   trends of GCN in the vision field, namely model lightweight and fusing
   GCN with other models to improve the performance of the visual model and
   meet the higher requirements of vision tasks.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which are capable of effectively
   processing graph-structural data, have been successfully applied in text
   classification task. Existing studies on GCN based text classification
   model largely concerns with the utilization of word co-occurrence and
   Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) information for graph
   construction, which to some extent ignore the context information of the
   texts. To solve this problem, we propose a gating context-aware text
   classification model with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
   Transformers (BERT) and graph convolutional network, named as Gating
   Context GCN (GC-GCN). More specifically, we integrate the graph
   embedding with BERT embedding by using a GCN with gating mechanism to
   enable the acquisition of context coding. We carry out text
   classification experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed
   model. Experimental results shown our model has respectively obtained
   0.19%, 0.57%, 1.05% and 1.17% improvements over the Text-GCN baseline on
   the 20NG, R8, R52, and Ohsumed benchmark datasets. Furthermore, to
   overcome the problem that word co-occurrence and TF-IDF are not suitable
   for graph construction for short texts, Euclidean distance is used to
   combine with word co-occurrence and TF-IDF information. We obtain an
   improvement by 1.38% on the MR dataset compared to Text-GCN baseline.

AB To better learn the dependency relationship between nodes, we address
   the relationship extraction task by capturing rich contextual
   dependencies based on the attention mechanism, and using distributional
   reinforcement learning to generate optimal relation information
   representation. This method is called Dual Attention Graph Convolutional
   Network (DAGCN), to adaptively integrate local features with their
   global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention
   modules on top of GCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in
   spatial and relational dimensions, respectively. The position attention
   module selectively aggregates the feature at each position by a weighted
   sum of the features at all positions of nodes internal features.
   Meanwhile, the relation attention module selectively emphasizes
   interdependent node relations by integrating associated features among
   all nodes. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules and use
   reinforcement learning to predict the classification of nodes
   relationship to further improve feature representation which contributes
   to more precise extraction results. The results on the TACRED and
   SemEval datasets show that the model can obtain more useful information
   for relational extraction tasks, and achieve better performances on
   various evaluation indexes.

AB Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a prerequisite guarantee for the
   realization of intelligent transportation, but it is a challenging task
   due to the complex spatial-temporal dependence and uncertainty of
   traffic flow. In most existing approaches, spatial correlation is
   captured using graph convolution networks in a pre-determined graph
   structure. However, some nodes in such a graph structure have spatial
   correlations between them but are missing a connection, so the hidden
   spatial correlations between these nodes cannot be captured. Traffic
   flow has dynamic characteristics, showing different characteristics over
   time. Most methods ignore the dynamics of traffic flow when modeling the
   spatio-temporal correlation of traffic flow. We proposed a new network
   model (MSTA-GCN) to solve the above problem. The model presents a gated
   adaptive graph convolutional network that captures the hidden spatial
   correlations between graph nodes from the adaptive. In addition, the
   model introduces a multi-head spatial-temporal attention mechanism to
   pay attention to spatial-temporal information of different historical
   moments and different spatial dimensions to effectively capture the
   dynamics of spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow. Extensive
   experiments were conducted on four datasets of PEMS. The experimental
   results show that the MSTA-GCN model has better forecasting performance
   compared with the baseline methods.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition is a research hotspot in the field of
   computer vision. Currently, the mainstream method is based on Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Although there are many advantages of
   GCNs, GCNs mainly rely on graph topologies to draw dependencies between
   the joints, which are limited in capturing long-distance dependencies.
   Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods have been applied to skeleton-based
   action recognition because they effectively capture long-distance
   dependencies. However, existing Transformer-based methods lose the
   inherent connection information of human skeleton joints because they do
   not yet focus on initial graph structure information. This paper aims to
   improve the accuracy of skeleton-based action recognition. Therefore, a
   Graph Skeleton Transformer network (GSTN) for action recognition is
   proposed, which is based on Transformer architecture to extract global
   features, while using undirected graph information represented by the
   symmetric matrix to extract local features. Two encodings are utilized
   in feature processing to improve joints' semantic and centrality
   features. In the process of multi-stream fusion strategies, a
   grid-search-based method is used to assign weights to each input stream
   to optimize the fusion results. We tested our method using three action
   recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. The
   experimental results show that our model's accuracy is comparable to
   state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Crowd counting has received significant attention in recent years due to
   its practical applications. In order to address the specific
   characteristics of RGB and thermal images, we have developed the graph
   enhancement and transformer aggregation network (GETANet) for generating
   representative density maps. Our approach incorporates several
   innovative modules to enhance accuracy. First, we introduced a
   position-adaptive module (PAM) that effectively counts individuals'
   positions and integrates features extracted from the main framework.
   Furthermore, we leveraged the advantages of graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs), which integrate spatial information and exploit relationships
   between nodes. Specifically, we designed a dual GCN module that further
   improves the model's performance by considering the spatial context and
   relationships among individuals in the crowd. To capture global image
   information and improve overall performance, we integrated a vision
   transformer into our model architecture. The vision transformer
   effectively captures global dependencies and enhances the model's
   ability to understand complex crowd scenes. Additionally, we designed a
   transformer information aggregation module (TIAM) that integrates
   information from multiple levels, resulting in a highly precise
   prediction map. Through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
   such as RGBT-CC and DroneRGBT, our GETANet demonstrated its
   effectiveness in RGB-thermal crowd counting tasks. Moreover, GETANet
   showcased remarkable generalization results on the ShanghaiTech-RGBD
   dataset. Our code has been made publicly available on GitHub at
   https://github.com/panyi95/GETANet.

AB Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of dynamic graphs is crucial
   since dynamic is a basic characteristic of real-world networks. The
   challenges of modeling dynamic graphs are as follows: (1) Real-world
   dynamics are frequently characterized by group effects, which
   essentially emerge from high-order interactions involving groups of
   entities. Therefore, the pairwise interactions revealed by the edges of
   graphs are insufficient to describe complex systems. (2) The graph data
   obtained from real systems are often noisy, and the spurious edges can
   interfere with the stability and efficiency of models. To address these
   issues, we propose a high-order topology-enhanced graph convolutional
   network for modeling dynamic graphs. The rationale behind it is that the
   symmetric substructure in a graph, called the maximal clique, can
   reflect group impacts from high-order interactions on the one hand,
   while not being readily disturbed by spurious links on the other hand.
   Then, we utilize two independent branches to model the distinct
   influence mechanisms of the two effects. Learnable parameters are used
   to tune the relative importance of the two effects during the process.
   We conduct link predictions on real-world datasets, including one social
   network and two citation networks. Results show that the average
   improvements of the high-order enhanced methods are 68%, 15%, and 280%
   over the corresponding backbones across datasets. The ablation study and
   perturbation analysis validate the effectiveness and robustness of the
   proposed method. Our research reveals that high-order structures provide
   new perspectives for studying the dynamics of graphs and highlight the
   necessity of employing higher-order topologies in the future.

AB Background Complex and diverse microbial communities play a pivotal role
   in human health and have become a new drug target. Exploring the
   connections between drugs and microbes not only provides profound
   insights into their mechanisms but also drives progress in drug
   discovery and repurposing. The use of wet lab experiments to identify
   associations is time-consuming and laborious. Hence, the advancement of
   precise and efficient computational methods can effectively improve the
   efficiency of association identification between microorganisms and
   drugs.Objective In this experiment, we propose a new deep learning
   model, a new multiview comparative hypergraph attention network (MCHAN)
   method for human microbe-drug association prediction.Methods First, we
   fuse multiple similarity matrices to obtain a fused microbial and drug
   similarity network. By combining graph convolutional networks with
   attention mechanisms, we extract key information from multiple
   perspectives. Then, we construct two network topologies based on the
   above fused data. One topology incorporates the concept of hypernodes to
   capture implicit relationships between microbes and drugs using virtual
   nodes to construct a hyperheterogeneous graph. Next, we propose a
   cross-contrastive learning task that facilitates the simultaneous
   guidance of graph embeddings from both perspectives, without the need
   for any labels. This approach allows us to bring nodes with similar
   features and network topologies closer while pushing away other nodes.
   Finally, we employ attention mechanisms to merge the outputs of the GCN
   and predict the associations between drugs and microbes.Results To
   confirm the effectiveness of this method, we conduct experiments on
   three distinct datasets. The results demonstrate that the MCHAN model
   surpasses other methods in terms of performance. Furthermore, case
   studies provide additional evidence confirming the consistent predictive
   accuracy of the MCHAN model.Conclusion MCHAN is expected to become a
   valuable tool for predicting potential associations between microbiota
   and drugs in the future.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have emerged as a powerful
   alternative tool for analyzing hyperspectral images (HSIs). Despite
   their impressive performance, current works strive to make GCN more
   sophisticated through either elaborate architecture or fancy training
   tricks, making them prohibitive for HSI data in practice. In this paper,
   we present a Graph Convolutional RVFL Network (GCRVFL), a simple but
   efficient GCN for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, we
   generalize the classic RVFL network into the graph domain by using graph
   convolution operations. This not only enables RVFL to handle
   graph-structured data, but also avoids iterative parameter adjustment by
   employing an efficient closed-form solution. Unlike previous works that
   perform HSI classification under a transductive framework, we regard HSI
   classification as a graph-level classification task, which makes GCRVFL
   scalable to large-scale HSI data. Extensive experiments on three
   benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed GCRVFL is able to
   achieve competitive results with fewer trainable parameters and
   adjustable hyperparameters and higher computational efficiency. In
   particular, we show that our approach is comparable to many existing
   approaches, including deep CNN models (e.g., ResNet and DenseNet) and
   popular GCN models (e.g., SGC and APPNP).

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used in medical images
   diagnostic research, because they can automatically learn powerful and
   robust feature representations. However, their performance might be
   significantly deteriorated by trivial or corrupted medical features and
   samples. Moreover, existing methods cannot simultaneously interpret the
   significant features and samples. To overcome these limitations, in this
   paper, we propose a novel dual interpretable graph convolutional
   network, namely FSNet, to simultaneously select significant features and
   samples, so as to boost model performance for medical diagnosis and
   interpretation. Specifically, the proposed network consists of three
   modules, two of which leverage one simple yet effective sparse mechanism
   to obtain feature and sample weight matrices for interpreting features
   and samples, respectively, and the third one is utilized for medical
   diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) datasets demonstrate the superior classification
   performance and interpretability over the recent state-of-the-art
   methods.

AB Anticipating pedestrians' activity is a necessary task for providing a
   safe and energy efficient environment in an urban area. By locating
   strategically sensors throughout the city useful information could be
   obtained. By knowing the average activity of those throughout different
   days of the week we could identify the typology of the buildings
   neighboring those sensors. For these type of purposes, clustering
   methods show great capability forming groups of items that have great
   similarity intra clusters and dissimilarity inter cluster. Different
   approaches are made to classify sensors depending on the typology of
   buildings surrounding them and the mean pedestrians' counts for
   different time intervals. By this way, sensors could be classified in
   different groups according to their activation patterns and the
   environment in which they are located through clustering processes and
   using graph convolutional networks. This study reveals that there is a
   close relationship between the activity pattern of the pedestrians' and
   the type of environment sensors that collect pedestrians' data are
   located. By this way, institutions could alleviate a great amount of
   effort needed to ensure safe and energy efficient urban areas, only
   knowing the typology of buildings of an urban zone.

AB GCN is a widely-used representation learning method for capturing hidden
   features in graph data. However, traditional GCNs suffer from the
   over-smoothing problem, hindering their ability to extract high-order
   information and obtain robust data representation. To overcome this
   limitation, we propose a novel graph model, the high-order graph
   attention network. Compared to other existing graph attention networks,
   our model can adaptively aggregate node features from multi-hop
   neighbors through an attention mechanism. Moreover, the edges in the
   original graph may not accurately represent the relationships between
   nodes. We implement a new approach to update the graph by using the
   aggregated node representation to adjust the edges with small step
   sizes. Additionally, we perform a theoretical analysis to demonstrate
   the relationships between our proposed model and other GCN models.
   Finally, we evaluate our proposed model against eight variants of GCN
   models on multiple widely-used benchmark datasets. The experimental
   results show the superiority of our proposed model over other models.

AB Wind forecasting is a typical and fundamental problem in the efficient
   operation of wind power-generation systems. Despite the developed
   brilliant techniques, current methods for wind forecasting still rely
   heavily on numerical weather prediction. To investigate the huge amount
   of meteorological data and to improve the forecasting ability, this
   letter proposes a temporal dynamic network with a learnable coupled
   adjacent matrix (TCNet), which takes observations of multiple
   meteorological elements as predictors for wind forecasting.
   Specifically, to better illustrate the inner property of wind
   components, a learnable coupled adjacent matrix (CAM) module is
   introduced. A spatially stable adjacent matrix is built to model the
   low-frequency part, while a temporally dynamic adjacent matrix is
   developed to extract the high-frequency one. Casting on this mechanism,
   the CAM can be embedded in a vanilla graph convolution network. Apart
   from that, a simple but effective temporal weights allocating strategy,
   named temporal dynamic (TED) module, is proposed to depict the
   cyclicity. By integrating TED with CAM, TCNet can effectively extract
   the spatiotemporal feature of wind speed and its correlation with other
   meteorological elements. Using observed datasets of meteorological
   elements in Denmark and the Netherlands, we conduct experiments to
   validate the performance and efficiency of our proposed model. The
   results indicate the proposed TCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
   graph convolutional networks (GCNs) methods and wind forecasting
   methods.

AB Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) to edge-perturbing attacks, such as maliciously
   inserting or deleting graph edges. However, theoretical proof of such
   vulnerability remains a big challenge, and effective defense schemes are
   still open issues. In this article, we first generalize the formulation
   of edge-perturbing attacks and strictly prove the vulnerability of GCNs
   to such attacks in node classification tasks. Following this, an
   anonymous GCN, named AN-GCN, is proposed to defend against
   edge-perturbing attacks. In particular, we present a node localization
   theorem to demonstrate how GCNs locate nodes during their training
   phase. In addition, we design a staggered Gaussian noise-based node
   position generator and a spectral graph convolution-based discriminator
   (in detecting the generated node positions). Furthermore, we provide an
   optimization method for the designed generator and discriminator. It is
   demonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks
   in node classification tasks, as AN-GCN is developed to classify nodes
   without the edge information (making it impossible for attackers to
   perturb edges anymore). Extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness
   of the general edge-perturbing attack (G-EPA) model in manipulating the
   classification results of the target nodes. More importantly, the
   proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification accuracy
   without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the
   state-of-the-art GCN.

AB Lymphomas are a group of malignant tumors developed from lymphocytes,
   which may occur in many organs. Therefore, accurately distinguishing
   lymphoma from solid tumors is of great clinical significance. Due to the
   strong ability of graph structure to capture the topology of the
   micro-environment of cells, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have
   been widely used in pathological image processing. Nevertheless, the
   softmax classification layer of the graph convolutional models cannot
   drive learned representations compact enough to distinguish some types
   of lymphomas and solid tumors with strong morphological analogies on
   H&E-stained images. To alleviate this problem, a prototype learning
   based model is proposed, namely graph convolutional prototype network
   (GCPNet). Specifically, the method follows the patch-to-slide
   architecture first to perform patch-level classification and obtain
   image-level results by fusing patch-level predictions. The
   classification model is assembled with a graph convolutional feature
   extractor and prototype-based classification layer to build more robust
   feature representations for classification. For model training, a
   dynamic prototype loss is proposed to give the model different
   optimization priorities at different stages of training. Besides, a
   prototype reassignment operation is designed to prevent the model from
   getting stuck in local minima during optimization. Experiments are
   conducted on a dataset of 183 Whole slide images (WSI) of gastric mucosa
   biopsy. The proposed method achieved superior performance than existing
   methods.Clinical relevance- The work proposed a new deep learning
   framework tailored to lymphoma recognition on pathological image of
   gastric mucosal biopsy to differentiate lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and
   inflammation.

AB Automatically assessing academic papers has enormous potential to reduce
   peer-review burden and individual bias. Existing studies strive for
   building sophisticated deep neural networks to identify academic value
   based on comprehensive data, e.g., academic graphs and full papers.
   However, these data are not always easy to access. And the content of
   the paper rather than other features outside the paper should matter in
   a fair assessment. Furthermore, while BERT models can maintain general
   semantics by pre-training on large-scale corpora, they tend to be
   over-smoothing due to stacked self-attention layers among unfiltered
   input tokens. Therefore, it is nontrivial to figure out distinguishable
   value of an academic paper from its limited content. In this study, we
   propose a novel deep neural network, namely Dual-view Graph Convolutions
   Enhanced BERT (DGC-BERT), for academic paper acceptance estimation. We
   combine the title and abstract of the paper as input. Then, a
   pre-trained BERT model is employed to extract the paper's general
   representations. Apart from hidden representations of the final layer,
   we highlight the first and last few layers as lexical and semantic
   views. In particular, we re-examine the dual-view filtered
   self-attention matrices via constructing two graphs, respectively. After
   that, two multi-hop Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are separately
   employed to capture pivotal and distant dependencies between the tokens.
   Moreover, the dual-view representations are facilitated by each other
   with biaffine attention modules. And a re-weighting gate is proposed to
   further streamline the dual-view representations with the help of the
   original BERT representation. Finally, whether the submitted paper could
   be acceptable is predicted based on the original language model features
   cooperated with the dual-view dependencies. Extensive data analyses and
   the full paper based MHCNN studies provide insights into the task and
   structural functions. Comparison experiments on two benchmark datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed DGC-BERT significantly outperforms
   alternative approaches, especially the state-of-the-art models like
   MHCNN and BERT variants. Additional analyses reveal significance and
   explainability of the proposed modules in the DGC-BERT. Our codes and
   settings have been released on Github
   (https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/DGC-BERT).

AB The cerebral cortex is folded as gyri and sulci, which provide the
   foundation to unveil anatomo-functional relationship of brain. Previous
   studies have extensively demonstrated that gyri and sulci exhibit
   intrinsic functional difference, which is further supported by
   morphological, genetic, and structural evidences. Therefore,
   systematically investigating the gyro-sulcal (G-S) functional difference
   can help deeply understand the functional mechanism of brain. By
   integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with advanced
   deep learning models, recent studies have unveiled the temporal
   difference in functional activity between gyri and sulci. However, the
   potential difference of functional connectivity, which represents
   functional dependency between gyri and sulci, is much unknown. Moreover,
   the regularity and variability of the G-S functional connectivity
   difference across multiple task domains remains to be explored. To
   address the two concerns, this study developed new anatomy-guided
   spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (AG-STGCNs) to investigate
   the regularity and variability of functional connectivity differences
   between gyri and sulci across multiple task domains. Based on 830
   subjects with seven different task-based and one resting state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) datasets from the public Human Connectome Project (HCP), we
   consistently found that there are significant differences of functional
   connectivity between gyral and sulcal regions within task domains
   compared with resting state (RS). Furthermore, there is considerable
   variability of such functional connectivity and information flow between
   gyri and sulci across different task domains, which are correlated with
   individual cognitive behaviors. Our study helps better understand the
   functional segregation of gyri and sulci within task domains as well as
   the anatomo-functional-behavioral relationship of the human brain.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in various biological
   processes and their abnormal expression could lead to the occurrence of
   diseases. Exploring the potential relationships between miRNAs and
   diseases can contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of complex
   diseases. The increasing databases storing miRNA and disease information
   provide opportunities to develop computational methods for discovering
   unobserved disease-related miRNAs, but there are still some challenges
   in how to effectively learn and fuse information from multi-source data.
   In this study, we propose a multi-view information fusion based method
   for miRNA-disease association (MDA)prediction, named MVIFMDA. Firstly,
   multiple heterogeneous networks are constructed by combining the known
   MDAs and different similarities of miRNAs and diseases based on
   multi-source information. Secondly, the topology features of miRNAs and
   diseases are obtained by using the graph convolutional network to each
   heterogeneous network view, respectively. Moreover, we design the
   attention strategy at the topology representation level to adaptively
   fuse representations including different structural information.
   Meanwhile, we learn the attribute representations of miRNAs and diseases
   from their similarity attribute views with convolutional neural
   networks, respectively. Finally, the complicated associations between
   miRNAs and diseases are reconstructed by applying a bilinear decoder to
   the combined features, which combine topology and attribute
   representations. Experimental results on the public dataset demonstrate
   that our proposed model consistently outperforms baseline methods. The
   case studies further show the ability of the MVIFMDA model for inferring
   underlying associations between miRNAs and diseases.

AB The complexes of long non-coding RNAs bound to proteins can be involved
   in regulating life activities at various stages of organisms. However,
   in the face of the growing number of lncRNAs and proteins, verifying
   LncRNA-Protein Interactions(LPI) based on traditional biological
   experiments is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, with the
   improvement of computing power, predicting LPI has met new development
   opportunity. In virtue of the state-of-the-art works, a framework called
   LncRNA-Protein Interactions based on Kernel Combinations and Graph
   Convolutional Networks (LPI-KCGCN) has been proposed in this article. We
   first construct kernel matrices by taking advantage of extracting both
   the lncRNAs and protein concerning the sequence features, sequence
   similarity features, expression features, and gene ontology. Then
   reconstruct the existent kernel matrices as the input of the next step.
   Combined with known LPI interactions, the generated similarity matrices,
   which can be used as features of the topology map of the LPI network,
   are exploited in extracting potential representations in the lncRNA and
   protein space using a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network. The
   predicted matrix can be finally obtained by training the network to
   produce scoring matrices w.r.t. lncRNAs and proteins. Different
   LPI-KCGCN variants are ensemble to derive the final prediction results
   and testify on balanced and unbalanced datasets. The 5-fold
   cross-validation shows that the optimal feature information combination
   on a dataset with 15.5% positive samples has an AUC value of 0.9714 and
   an AUPR value of 0.9216. On another highly unbalanced dataset with only
   5% positive samples, LPI-KCGCN also has outperformed the
   state-of-the-art works, which achieved an AUC value of 0.9907 and an
   AUPR value of 0.9267. The code and dataset can be downloaded from

AB Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted significant attentions
   in recent years. To model the skeleton data, most popular methods
   utilize graph convolutional networks to fuse nodes located in different
   parts of the graph to obtain rich geometric information. However, these
   methods cannot be generalized to different graph structures due to their
   dependencies on the input of the topological structure. In this article,
   we design a novel hyperbolic manifold aware network without introducing
   a dynamic graph. Instead, it leverages Riemannian geometry attributes of
   a hyperbolic manifold. Specifically, this method utilizes the Poincare
   model to embed the tree-like structure of the skeleton into a hyperbolic
   space to automatically capture hierarchical features, which may explore
   the underlying manifold of the data. To extract spatio-temporal features
   in the network, the features in manifold space are projected to a
   tangent space, and a tangent space features translation method based on
   the Levi-Civita connection was proposed. In addition, we introduce the
   geometric knowledge of Riemannian manifolds to further explain how
   features are transformed in the tangent space. Finally, we conduct
   experiments on several 3-D skeleton data sets with different structures,
   successfully verifying the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed
   method.

AB In order to carry out more accurate retrieval across image-text
   modalities, some scholars use fine-grained feature to align image and
   text. Most of them directly use attention mechanism to align image
   regions and words in the sentence, and ignore the fact that semantics
   related to an object is abstract and cannot be accurately expressed by
   object information alone. To overcome this weakness, we propose a
   hierarchical feature aggregation algorithm based on graph convolutional
   networks (GCN) to facilitate object semantic integrity by integrating
   attributes of an object and relations between objects hierarchically in
   both image and text modalities. In order to eliminate the semantic gap
   between modalities, we propose a cross-modal feature fusion method based
   on transformer to generate modal-specific feature representations by
   integrating both the object feature and global feature from the other
   modality. Then we map the fusion feature into a common space. Experiment
   results on the most frequently-used datasets MSCOCO and Flickr30K show
   the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with the latest
   methods.

AB Rainstorm prediction is of considerable importance for a wide range of
   applications, such as weather forecasting, disaster management, and
   flood monitoring. Predicting rare and extreme rainstorm events is
   challenging because only sparse historical samples are available for
   training. Additionally, rainstorm events are caused by many complex
   meteorological factors, involving heterogeneous meteorological
   observations. The interactions between these factors are also difficult
   to handle when making predictions. To address these challenges, we
   propose an integrated deep learning-driven prediction method based on
   adaptive attributed spatio-temporal affinities between spatio-temporal
   nodes, including spatio-temporal proximity and multi-dimensional
   meteorological attribute similarity using graph embedding. Based on the
   learned spatio-temporal affinity matrices, we apply graph convolutional
   networks to implement non-linear predictions. In particular, we develop
   an integrated loss function to address the class imbalance caused by
   rare rainstorm events. Our empirical evaluation results show that the
   proposed prediction method outperforms several competing
   state-of-the-art methods on two rainstorm datasets. We attribute the
   performance improvements of the proposed method to its ability to
   capture complex rainstorm development patterns using limited historical
   rainstorm samples and using heterogeneous spatio-temporal information.

AB Privacy image classification (PIC) has attracted increasing attention as
   it can help people make appropriate privacy decisions when sharing
   images. Most recently, some pioneer research efforts have been made to
   utilize multimodal information for PIC, since multi-modality can provide
   richer information than single modality. Those research efforts on
   multimodal PIC are under the assumption of independently identically
   distribution. However, connections between different modalities commonly
   exist in real-world cases. Taking the modalities of scene and object as
   example, in the scene of 'library/indoor', the object 'book jacket'
   resides with high probabilities. To this end, in this paper, a novel PIC
   approach, called CoupledPIC, is proposed to bridge this gap by
   comprehensively capturing the coupling relations between different
   modalities. In CoupledPIC, two submodules are designed to capture
   explicit and implicit coupling relations between different modalities
   respectively. The explicit modality coupling is learned with a tensor
   fusion networks based submodule, via the direct interaction of features.
   For the implicit modality coupling, a graph convolutional networks based
   submodule is proposed to learn on both the initial graphs and attention
   guided graphs, via information aggregation on graphs. Extensive
   experiments on the public benchmark, PicAlert, demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed CoupledPIC, yielding significant
   improvement by modeling inter-modality coupling information.

AB Recently, skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted a lot of
   research attention in the field of computer vision. Graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs), which model the human body skeletons as
   spatial-temporal graphs, have shown excellent results. However, the
   existing methods only focus on the local physical connection between the
   joints, and ignore the non-physical dependencies among joints. To
   address this issue, we propose a hypergraph neural network (Hyper-GNN)
   to capture both spatial-temporal information and high-order dependencies
   for skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, to overcome the
   influence of noise caused by unrelated joints, we design the Hyper-GNN
   to extract the local and global structure information via the hyperedge
   (i.e., non-physical connection) constructions. In addition, the
   hypergraph attention mechanism and improved residual module are induced
   to further obtain the discriminative feature representations. Finally, a
   three-stream Hyper-GNN fusion architecture is adopted in the whole
   framework for action recognition. The experimental results performed on
   two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve
   the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art
   skeleton-based methods.

AB Social networks are an essential component of the Internet of People
   (IoP) and play an important role in stimulating interactive
   communication among people. Graph convolutional networks provide methods
   for social network analysis with its impressive performance in
   semi-supervised node classification. However, the existing methods are
   based on the assumption of balanced data distribution and ignore the
   imbalanced problem of social networks. In order to extract the valuable
   information from imbalanced data for decision making, a novel method
   named minority-weighted graph neural network (mGNN) is presented in this
   article. It extends imbalanced classification ideas in the traditional
   machine learning field to graph-structured data to improve the
   classification performance of graph neural networks. In a node feature
   aggregation stage, the node membership values among nodes are calculated
   for minority nodes' feature aggregation enhancement. In an oversampling
   stage, the cost-sensitive learning is used to improve edge prediction
   results of synthetic minority nodes, and further raise their importance.
   In addition, a Gumbel distribution is adopted as an activation function.
   The proposed mGNN is evaluated on six social network data sets.
   Experimental results show that it yields promising results for
   imbalanced node classification.

AB Extracting entity relations from unstructured medical texts is a
   fundamental task in the field of medical information extraction. In
   relation extraction, dependency trees contain rich structural
   information that helps capture the long-range relations between
   entities. However, many models cannot effectively use dependency
   information or learn sentence information adequately. In this paper, we
   propose a relation extraction model based on syntactic dependency
   structure information. First, the model learns sentence sequence
   information by Bi-LSTM. Then, the model learns syntactic dependency
   structure information through graph convolutional networks. Meanwhile,
   in order to remove irrelevant information from the dependencies, the
   model adopts a new pruning strategy. Finally, the model adds a
   multi-head attention mechanism to focus on the entity information in the
   sentence from multiple aspects. We evaluate the proposed model on a
   Chinese medical entity relation extraction dataset. Experimental results
   show that our model can learn dependency relation information better and
   has higher performance than other baseline models.

AB Graph embedding based methods have been used in recommendation systems
   recently, owing to their advances in modeling nodes as embeddings in a
   low-dimensional space. By effective neighborhood aggregation, graph
   convolutional networks can exploit high-order connections of neighbors
   such that the learned embeddings could be more informative thus improve
   the recommendation performance. However, user and item representations
   learned by graph aggregation inherently contain uncertainty due to
   sparsity of user-item interactions and noise of item features. To
   address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal variational graph
   auto-encoder (MVGAE) method. Specifically, we design modality-specific
   variational encoders that learn a Gaussian variable for each node
   whereas the mean vector represents semantic information and the variance
   vector denotes the noise level of the corresponding modality. Moreover,
   with the conditional independence assumption, the modality-specific
   Gaussian node embeddings are fused according to the product-of-experts
   principle, where the semantic information in each modality is weighted
   based on the estimated uncertainty level. Extensive experiments on three
   public datasets, Amazon Movies, Amazon Electronics and AliShop-7 C,
   demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance
   when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Existing methods in relation extraction have leveraged the lexical
   features in the word sequence and the syntactic features in the parse
   tree. Though effective, the lexical features extracted from the
   successive word sequence may introduce some noise that has little or no
   meaningful content. Meanwhile, the syntactic features are usually
   encoded via graph convolutional networks which have restricted receptive
   field. In addition, the relation between lexical and syntactic features
   in the representation space has been largely neglected. To address the
   above limitations, we propose a multi-scale representation and metric
   learning framework to exploit the feature and relation hierarchy for RE
   tasks. Methodologically, we build a lexical and syntactic feature and
   relation hierarchy in text data. Technically, we first develop a
   multi-scale convolutional neural network to aggregate the non-successive
   lexical patterns in the word sequence. We also design a multi-scale
   graph convolutional network to increase the receptive field via the
   coarsened syntactic graph. Moreover, we present a multi-scale metric
   learning paradigm to exploit both the feature-level relation between
   lexical and syntactic features and the sample-level relation between
   instances with the same or different classes. Extensive experiments on
   three public datasets for two RE tasks prove that our model achieves a
   new state-of-the-art performance.

AB This article presents FLGC, a simple yet effective fully linear graph
   convolutional network for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.
   Instead of using gradient descent, we train FLGC based on computing a
   global optimal closed-form solution with a decoupled procedure,
   resulting in a generalized linear framework and making it easier to
   implement, train, and apply. We show that (1) FLGC is powerful to deal
   with both graph-structured data and regular data, (2) training graph
   convolutional models with closed-form solutions improve computational
   efficiency without degrading performance, and (3) FLGC acts as a natural
   generalization of classic linear models in the non-Euclidean domain
   (e.g., ridge regression and subspace clustering). Furthermore, we
   implement a semi-supervised FLGC and an unsupervised FLGC by introducing
   an initial residual strategy, enabling FLGC to aggregate long-range
   neighborhoods and alleviate over-smoothing. We compare our
   semi-supervised and unsupervised FLGCs against many state-of-the-art
   methods on a variety of classification and clustering benchmarks,
   demonstrating that the proposed FLGC models consistently outperform
   previous methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and learning
   efficiency. The core code of our FLGC is released at

AB Human skeleton contains intuitive information of motions, therefore, it
   has been widely studied in action analysis tasks. As a part of action
   analysis, traditional models human action assessment by
   handcrafted-feature-based methods, such as dynamic time warping (DTW).
   These methods only extract the similarity of particular spatiotemporal
   features, whereas the global spatio-temporal relevance of action
   analysis tends to be ignored. In this paper, we propose a regression
   assessment model for action spatio-temporal features, which encodes the
   temporal features, spatial features and fused features respectively. The
   self-attention mechanism is taken advantage of to fuse the decoupling
   features, and then the overall score of action was calculated by
   regression. Specifically, via structure-feature fusion adaptive graph
   convolutional networks (SFAGCN), our action assessment network models
   the deep dependence of global spatio-temporal feature to address the
   difficulties of limited expressive ability and generalization.
   Furthermore, the topology of the skeletal graph and the features of the
   joints are merged by decoupling the spatio-temporal correlations. To
   confirm the effectiveness of our assessment model, we conduct
   experiments on six Olympic Games assessment tasks and exceed the
   state-of-the-art performance in Spearman's rank correlation analysis.

AB Sarcasm detection remains a challenge for numerous Natural Language
   Processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification or stance
   prediction. Existing sarcasm detection studies attempt to capture the
   subtle semantic incongruity patterns by using contextual information and
   graph information through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). However,
   direct application of dependence may inevitably introduce noisy
   information and inferiorly in modeling long-distance or disconnected
   words in the dependency tree. To better learn the sentiment
   inconsistencies between terms, we propose an Affection Enhanced
   Relational Graph Attention network (ARGAT) by jointly considering the
   affective information and the dependency information. Specifically, we
   use Relational Graph Attention Networks (RGAT) to integrate relation
   information guided by a trainable matrix of relation types and
   synchronously use GCNs to integrate affection information explicitly
   donated by affective adjacency matrixes. The employment of RGAT
   contributes to information interaction of structural relevant word pairs
   with a long distance. With the enhancement of affective information, the
   proposed model can capture complex forms of sarcastic expressions.
   Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that our proposed
   approach outperforms state-of-the-art sarcasm detection methods. The
   best-improved results of accuracy and F1 are 4.19% and 4.33%,
   respectively.

AB Accurate short-term passenger flow prediction in urban rail transit is

   However, accurate passenger flow prediction still faces challenges,
   including modeling the dynamics of passenger flow data in spatial and
   temporal dimensions and capturing the interactions between the inflows
   and outflows. To solve these problems, a novel model called the
   multi-feature fusion graph convolutional network (MFGCN) is proposed.
   Firstly, parallel graph branch networks are established to describe
   inflow and outflow information from geographic and semantic
   perspectives. Then, in the spatial dimension, the graph convolutional
   networks with spatial attention are designed to learn the dynamic
   spatial correlations of nodes in the two graphs. In the temporal
   dimension, the long short-term memory networks with temporal attention
   are developed to learn the dynamic temporal dependencies of passenger
   flow data. Finally, a three-dimensional residual network is established
   to capture the spatial-temporal interactive dependencies between inflows
   and outflows. Experiments on Nanning Metro Line 1 passenger flow
   datasets demonstrated that MFGCN outperformed the existing baseline
   models, which could provide technical support for URT network operation
   management.

AB With the emergence of blockchain technology, the cryptocurrency market
   has experienced significant growth in recent years, simultaneously
   fostering environments conducive to cybercrimes such as phishing scams.
   Phishing scams on blockchain platforms like Ethereum have become a grave
   economic threat. Consequently, there is a pressing demand for effective
   detection mechanisms for these phishing activities to establish a secure
   financial transaction environment. However, existing methods typically
   utilize only the most recent transaction record when constructing
   features, resulting in the loss of vast amounts of transaction data and
   failing to adequately reflect the characteristics of nodes. Addressing
   this need, this study introduces a multiscale feature fusion approach
   integrated with a graph convolutional network model to detect phishing
   scams on Ethereum. A node basic feature set comprising 12 features is
   initially designed based on the Ethereum transaction dataset in the
   basic feature module. Subsequently, in the edge embedding representation
   module, all transaction times and amounts between two nodes are sorted,
   and a gate recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is employed to capture
   the temporal features within this transaction sequence, generating a
   fixed-length edge embedding representation from variable-length input.
   In the time trading feature module, attention weights are allocated to
   all embedding representations surrounding a node, aggregating the edge
   embedding representations and structural relationships into the node.
   Finally, combining basic and time trading features of the node, graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs), SAGEConv, and graph attention networks
   (GATs) are utilized to classify phishing nodes. The performance of these
   three graph convolution-based deep learning models is validated on a
   real Ethereum phishing scam dataset, demonstrating commendable
   efficiency. Among these, SAGEConv achieves an F1-score of 0.958, an
   AUC-ROC value of 0.956, and an AUC-PR value of 0.949, outperforming
   existing methods and baseline models.

AB This study focuses on enhancing the prediction of regulatory functional
   sites in DNA and RNA sequences, a crucial aspect of gene regulation.
   Current methods, such as motif overrepresentation and machine learning,
   often lack specificity. To address this issue, the study leverages
   evolutionary information and introduces Graphylo, a deep -learning
   approach for predicting transcription factor binding sites in the human
   genome. Graphylo combines Convolutional Neural Networks for DNA
   sequences with Graph Convolutional Networks on phylogenetic trees, using
   information from placental mammals' genomes and evolutionary history.
   The research demonstrates that Graphylo consistently outperforms both
   single -species deep learning techniques and methods that incorporate
   inter -species conservation scores on a wide range of datasets. It
   achieves this by utilizing a species -based attention model for
   evolutionary insights and an integrated gradient approach for nucleotide
   -level model interpretability. This innovative approach offers a
   promising avenue for improving the accuracy of regulatory site
   prediction in genomics.

AB Multimodal retrieval has received widespread consideration since it can
   commendably provide massive related data support for the development of
   computational social systems (CSSs). However, the existing works still
   face the following challenges: 1) rely on the tedious manual marking
   process when extended to CSS, which not only introduces subjective
   errors but also consumes abundant time and labor costs; 2) only using
   strongly aligned data for training, lacks concern for the adjacency
   information, which makes the poor robustness and semantic heterogeneity
   gap difficult to be effectively fit; and 3) mapping features into
   real-valued forms, which leads to the characteristics of high storage
   and low retrieval efficiency. To address these issues in turn, we have
   designed a multimodal retrieval framework based on web-knowledge-driven,
   called unsupervised and robust graph convolutional hashing (URGCH). The
   specific implementations are as follows: first, a "secondary semantic
   self-fusion" approach is proposed, which mainly extracts semantic-rich
   features through pretrained neural networks, constructs the joint
   semantic matrix through semantic fusion, and eliminates the process of
   manual marking; second, a "adaptive computing" approach is designed to
   construct enhanced semantic graph features through the knowledge-infused
   of neighborhoods and uses graph convolutional networks for knowledge
   fusion coding, which enables URGCH to sufficiently fit the semantic
   modality gap while obtaining satisfactory robustness features; Third,
   combined with hash learning, the multimodality data are mapped into the
   form of binary code, which reduces storage requirements and improves
   retrieval efficiency. Eventually, we perform plentiful experiments on
   the web dataset. The results evidence that URGCH exceeds other baselines
   about 1%-3.7% in mean average precisions (MAPs), displays superior
   performance in all the aspects, and can meaningfully provide multimodal
   data retrieval services to CSS.

AB Learning embeddings representations of users and items lies at the core
   of modern recommender systems. Existing methods based on Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) and sequential recommendation typically
   obtain a user's or an item's embedding by mapping from pre-existing
   features into better embeddings for users and items, such as ID and
   attributes. GCN integrates the user-item interaction as the bipartite
   graph structure into the embedding process, which can better represent
   sparse data, but cannot capture users' long-term interests. Sequential
   recommendation seek to capture the "context" of users' activities based
   on their historical actions, but requires dense data to support it. The
   goal of our work is to combine the advantages of GCN and sequential
   recommendation models by proposing a novel Self-Attention based
   Sequential recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks (SASGCN). It
   uses multiple lightweight GCN layers to capture high-order connectivity
   between users and items, and by introducing ratings as auxiliary
   information into the user-item interaction matrix, it provides richer
   information. By incorporating self-attention based methods, the proposed
   model capture long-term semantics through relatively few actions.
   Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our model
   outperforms various state-of-the-art models consistently.

AB With the advances of data-driven machine learning research, a wide
   variety of prediction problems have been tackled. It has become critical
   to explore how machine learning and specifically deep learning methods
   can be exploited to analyse healthcare data. A major limitation of
   existing methods has been the focus on grid-like data; however, the
   structure of physiological recordings are often irregular and unordered,
   which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as a matrix. As such,
   graph neural networks have attracted significant attention by exploiting
   implicit information that resides in a biological system, with
   interacting nodes connected by edges whose weights can be determined by
   either temporal associations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we
   thoroughly review the different types of graph architectures and their
   applications in healthcare. We provide an overview of these methods in a
   systematic manner, organized by their domain of application including
   functional connectivity, anatomical structure, and electrical-based
   analysis. We also outline the limitations of existing techniques and
   discuss potential directions for future research.

AB Due to the continuing colossal socio-economic losses caused by traffic
   accidents, it is of prime importance to precisely forecast the traffic
   accident risk to reduce future accidents. In this paper, we use
   dangerous driving statistics from driving log data and multi-graph
   learning to enhance predictive performance. We first conduct
   geographical and temporal correlation analyses to quantify the
   relationship between dangerous driving and actual accidents. Then, to
   learn various dependencies between districts besides the traditional
   adjacency matrix, we simultaneously model both static and dynamic graphs
   representing the spatio-temporal contextual relationships with
   heterogeneous environmental data, including the dangerous driving
   behavior. A graph is generated for each type of the relationships.
   Ultimately, we propose an end-to-end framework, called MG-TAR, to
   effectively learn the association of multiple graphs for accident risk
   prediction by adopting multi-view graph neural networks with a
   multi-attention module. Thorough experiments on ten real-world datasets
   show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, MG-TAR reduces the
   error of predicting the accident risk by up to 23% and improves the
   accuracy of predicting the most dangerous areas by up to 27%.

AB In this study, we consider fully automated action recognition based on
   deep learning in the industrial environment. In contrast to most
   existing methods, which rely on professional knowledge to construct
   complex hand-crafted features, or only use basic deep-learning methods,
   such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract information
   from images in the production process, we exploit a novel and effective
   method, which integrates multiple deep-learning networks including CNNs,
   spatial transformer networks (STNs), and graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs) to process video data in industrial workflows. The proposed
   method extracts both spatial and temporal information from video data.
   The spatial information is extracted by estimating the human pose of
   each frame, and the skeleton image of the human body in each frame is
   obtained. Furthermore, multi-frame skeleton images are processed by GCN
   to obtain temporal information, meaning the action recognition results
   are predicted automatically. By training on a large human action
   dataset, Kinetics, we apply the proposed method to the real-world
   industrial environment and achieve superior performance compared with
   the existing methods.

AB Traffic flow forecasting is an essential task of an intelligent
   transportation system (ITS), closely related to intelligent
   transportation management and resource scheduling. Dynamic
   spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data make traffic flow
   forecasting to be a challenging task. Most existing research cannot
   model dynamic spatial and temporal correlations to achieve
   well-forecasting performance. The multi-head self-attention mechanism is
   a valuable method to capture dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, and
   combining it with graph convolutional networks is a promising solution.
   Therefore, we propose a multi-head self-attention spatiotemporal graph
   convolutional network (MSASGCN) model. It can effectively capture local
   correlations and potential global correlations of spatial structures,
   can handle dynamic evolution of the road network, and, in the time
   dimension, can effectively capture dynamic temporal correlations.
   Experiments on two real datasets verify the stability of our proposed
   model, obtaining a better prediction performance than the baseline
   algorithms. The correlation metrics get significantly reduced compared
   with traditional time series prediction methods and deep learning
   methods without using graph neural networks, according to MAE and RMSE
   results. Compared with advanced traffic flow forecasting methods, our
   model also has a performance improvement and a more stable prediction
   performance. We also discuss some problems and challenges in traffic
   forecasting.

AB Purpose: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) can cause aneurysmal
   subarachnoid hemorrhage, a severe and often lethal type of stroke.
   Automated labeling of intracranial arteries can facilitate the
   identification of risk factors associated with UIAs. This study aims to
   improve intracranial artery labeling using atlas-based features in graph
   convolutional networks.
   Approach: We included three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic
   resonance angiography scans from 150 individuals. Two widely used graph
   convolutional operators, GCNConv and GraphConv, were employed in models
   trained to classify 12 bifurcations of interest. Cross-validation was
   applied to explore the effectiveness of atlas-based features in node
   classification. The results were tested for statistically significant
   differences using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Model repeatability and
   calibration were assessed on the test set for both operators. In
   addition, we evaluated model interpretability and node feature
   contribution using explainable artificial intelligence.
   Results: Atlas-based features led to statistically significant
   improvements in node classification (p<0.05). The results showed that
   the best discrimination and calibration performances were obtained using
   the GraphConv operator, which yielded a mean recall of 0.87, precision
   of 0.90, and expected calibration error of 0.02.
   Conclusions: The addition of atlas-based features improved node
   classification results. The GraphConv operator, which incorporates
   higher-order structural information during training, is recommended over
   the GCNConv operator based on the accuracy and calibration of predicted
   outcomes.

AB In recent years, great achievements have been made in graph
   convolutional network (GCN) for non-Euclidean spatial data feature
   extraction, especially the skeleton-based feature extraction. However,
   the fixed graph structure determined by the fixed adjacency matrix
   usually causes the problems such as the weak spatial modeling ability,
   the unsatisfactory generalization performance, the excessively large
   number of model parameters, and so on. In this paper, a spatially
   adaptive residual graph convolutional network (SARGCN) is proposed for
   action recognition based on skeleton feature extraction. Firstly, the
   uniform and fixed topology is not required in our graph. Secondly, a
   learnable parameter matrix is added to the GCN operation, which can
   enhance the model's capabilities of feature extraction and
   generalization, while reducing the number of parameters. Therefore,
   compared with the several existing models mentioned in this paper, the
   least number of parameters are used in our model while ensuring the
   comparable recognition accuracy. Finally, inspired by the ResNet
   architecture, a residual connection is introduced in GCN to obtain
   higher accuracy at lower computational costs and learning difficulties.
   Extensive experimental on two large-scale datasets results validate the
   effectiveness of our proposed approach, namely NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU
   RGB+D 120.

AB Social networks are a crucial component of the Internet of People (IoP),
   which represents cutting-edge of Internet of Things (IoT). Predicting a
   large number of unknown node labels with few known labels is one of the
   challenging problems in social network analysis. Fortunately, the graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and subsequent variants have achieved
   remarkable performance on semi-supervised node classification (SSNC).
   However, previous works only focus on the case of clean labels and
   rarely study the problem of SSNC under noisy labels (SSNCNL), which is a
   more challenging and practical problem in the realm of weakly supervised
   learning. To cope with the aforementioned challenge, we present a novel
   dual mutual robust GCN named DMRGCN with inspiration from deep mutual
   learning and robust learning in the domain of image recognition.
   Specifically, we first employ two GCNs with different learning abilities
   to construct network architecture. Then, we define a joint loss function
   which consists of a weighted combination of supervised loss, mutual
   loss, and robust loss. Finally, we train the network under the
   pseudo-siamese network paradigm. Experimental results on three social
   network benchmark datasets with different levels of noise on labels
   demonstrate that DMRGCN outperforms the vanilla GCN and several variants
   on classification accuracy. In particular, under the two conditions of
   labels without noise and with noise, the node classification accuracy
   obtained by our proposed DMRGCN can be 3.05% and 6.44% higher than that
   of the vanilla GCN, respectively.

AB Passenger flow anomaly detection in urban rail transit networks (URTNs)
   is critical in managing surging demand and informing effective
   operations planning and controls in the network. Existing studies have
   primarily focused on identifying the source of anomalies at a single
   station by analysing the time-series characteristics of passenger flow.
   However, they ignored the high-dimensional and complex spatial features
   of passenger flow and the dynamic behaviours of passengers in URTNs
   during anomaly detection. This article proposes a novel anomaly
   detection methodology based on a deep learning framework consisting of a
   graph convolution network (GCN)-informer model and a Gaussian naive
   Bayes model. The GCN-informer model is used to capture the spatial and
   temporal features of inbound and outbound passenger flows, and it is
   trained on normal datasets. The Gaussian naive Bayes model is used to
   construct a binary classifier for anomaly detection, and its parameters
   are estimated by feeding the normal and abnormal test data into the
   trained GCN-informer model. Experiments are conducted on a real-world
   URTN passenger flow dataset from Beijing. The results show that the
   proposed framework has superior performance compared to existing anomaly
   detection algorithms in detecting network-level passenger flow
   anomalies.This article is part of the theme issue 'Artificial
   intelligence in failure analysis of transportation infrastructure and
   materials'.

AB The development of efficient and stable photocatalysts for degradation
   of refractory pollutants using minimal amounts of metal remains a major
   challenge. Herein, we synthesize a novel catalyst by fabrication of
   manganese (III) acetylacetonate complex [Mn (acac)3] over graphitic
   carbon nitride (GCN) denoted as 2-Mn/GCN by facile ultra-sonication
   method. The fabrication of the metal complex enables the migration of
   electrons from the conduction band of graphitic carbon nitride to Mn
   (acac)3, and migration of holes from valence band of Mn (acac)3 to GCN
   upon irradiation. Exploiting the improved surface properties, light
   absorption, and charge separation ensure generation of superoxide and
   hydroxyl radicals resulting in the rapid degradation of a variety of
   pollutants. The designed 2-Mn/GCN catalyst realized 99.59% rhodamine b
   (RhB) degradation in 55 min and 97.6% metronidazole (MTZ) degradation in
   40 min with 0.7% Mn content. The influence of catalyst amount, different
   pH and presence of anions on the degradation kinetics was also explored
   to offer insights into photoactive material design.

AB Modeling sequences with spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks
   has become a mainstream paradigm in skeleton-based action recognition.
   However, many existing methods adopt redundant or cluttered structures
   to mine the key action features, thus making it difficult to achieve a
   balanced or leading performance in accuracy and efficiency. In this
   paper, we propose a novel framework, referred to as Motion Complement
   and Temporal Multifocusing Network (MCTM-Net), to capture the
   relationships within skeleton sequences by means of an efficient
   decomposition of the spatiotemporal graph model. Specifically, for
   spatial modeling, we introduce a motion-related relational descriptor
   that extends the channel dimension so as to enhance the modeling of
   motion salient regions as a complement to the conventional physical
   adjacency relationships. An improved parameterized physical relationship
   model is also proposed to better fit the data characteristics. As for
   temporal modeling, we propose an efficient multi-focus temporal
   information acquisition strategy that aggregates the information from
   multiple temporal spans and adjacent regions. We conduct extensive
   experiments on multiple representative datasets, including NTU-RGB+D
   (60&120), Northwestern-UCLA, and UWA3D Multiview Activity II, to
   validate our innovations. The experimental results show the
   effectiveness of our method.

AB Spatiotemporal safety forecasting has various applications in the
   neuroscience, climate and transportation domains. It is challenging due
   to (1) the complex spatial dependency on networks, (2) non-linear
   temporal dynamics with changing conditions and (3) the inherent
   difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, a
   safety prediction model called the Spatial-Temporal Mixed Attention
   Graph-based Convolution model (STMAG) is proposed. Specifically, STMAG
   captures spatial dependency using graph convolutional networks (GCN),
   and temporal dependency using the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
   architecture with the mixed attention mechanisms. A case study on the
   implementation of this model in traffic safety prediction is given as an
   example. Traffic safety forecasting is one canonical example of such a
   learning task, which is also a crucial problem to improving
   transportation and public safety. A number of detailed features (such as
   vehicle type, braking state, whether changing lanes or not) and
   exogenous variables (such as weather, time and road condition) are
   extracted from our big datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive
   experiments to evaluate the STMAG framework on real-world large-scale
   road network traffic datasets. Extensive experiments on our dataset show
   that the STMAG framework makes reasonably accurate predictions and
   significantly improves the prediction accuracy over baseline approaches.

AB This paper introduces a generative model named the travel time
   reliability-generative adversarial network (TTRGAN) model for predicting
   network-wide TTR using automatic vehicle identification data. The
   TTR-GAN model is capable of generating predicted travel time samples,
   enabling the assessment of network-wide TTR without the need to assume a
   specific travel time distribution. In the TTR-GAN model, a combination
   of graph convolutional networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural
   networks is employed within the GAN framework. When training the TTR-GAN
   model, special attention is given to adjusting the mean and standard
   deviation of the generated samples, aiming for a closer resemblance to
   real samples. Experiments conducted on a road network in China
   demonstrate the predictive capability of the proposed TTR-GAN model,
   surpassing several benchmark models such as the LSTM neural network,
   moving average model, and GAN model in terms of statistical, buffer
   time, and probability distribution measures. By incorporating the mean
   and standard deviation into the loss function, the TTR-GAN model
   achieves an 18.2% reduction in Jensen-Shannon divergence between
   predicted and real samples. Furthermore, the model's performance in
   real-world applications is illustrated through a sensitivity test.

AB Pharmaceuticals, which have been praised for protecting countless lives,
   have become a new category of envi-ronmental pollutants in recent
   decades as most of these pharmaceutical compounds are discovered in
   water bodies in concentrations ranging from ng/L to mg/L. Recently,
   metal-free g-C3N4 (GCN)-based composites have received considerable
   attention for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds. In this
   study, GCN/BiOCl composite was prepared using a simple
   ultrasonication-assisted stirring method and characterized using various
   analytical and spectroscopic techniques including XRD, FTIR, PL,
   Elemental mapping, UV-DRS, FESEM, HRTEM, and TGA. The as-prepared
   composite was utilized to degrade levofloxacin (LVX) under solar light
   irradiation and showed excellent stability for the degradation of LVX.
   Furthermore, the universality of the GCN/BiOCl composite was
   investigated by degrading diverse pharmaceuticals such as ofloxacin
   (OFX), norfloxacin (NOX), ciproflox-acin (COX), and ketorolac
   tromethamine (KTC) in an aqueous phase. Therefore, this work provides an
   effective method to degrade pharmaceutical contaminants simultaneously
   in water using GCN/BiOCl composite.

AB We propose a novel and flexible roof modeling approach that can be used
   for constructing planar 3D polygon roof meshes. Our method uses a graph
   structure to encode roof topology and enforces the roof validity by
   optimizing a simple but effective planarity metric we propose. This
   approach is signifficantly more efficient than using general purpose 3D
   modeling tools such as 3ds Max or SketchUp, and more powerful and
   expressive than specialized tools such as the straight skeleton. Our
   optimization-based formulation is also flexible and can accommodate
   different styles and user preferences for roof modeling. We showcase two
   applications. The first application is an interactive roof editing
   framework that can be used for roof design or roof reconstruction from
   aerial images. We highlight the efficiency and generality of our
   approach by constructing a mesh-image paired dataset consisting of 2539
   roofs. Our second application is a generative model to synthesize new
   roof meshes from scratch. We use our novel dataset to combine machine
   learning and our roof optimization techniques, by using transformers and
   graph convolutional networks to model roof topology, and our roof
   optimization methods to enforce the planarity constraint.

AB Current cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable anonymity
   by using public keys to represent user accounts. On the other hand,
   inferring blockchain account types (i.e., miners, smart contracts or
   exchanges), which are also referred to as blockchain identities, is
   significant in many scenarios, such as risk assessment and trade
   regulation. Existing work on blockchain deanonymization mainly focuses
   on Bitcoin that supports simple transactions of cryptocurrencies. As the
   popularity of decentralized application (DApp) platform blockchains with
   Turing-complete smart contracts, represented by Ethereum, identity
   inference in blockchain faces new challenges because of user diversity
   and complexity of activities enabled by smart contracts. In this paper,
   we propose I(2)GL, an identify inference approach based on big graph
   analytics and learning to address these challenges. Specifically, I(2)GL
   constructs a transaction graph and aims to infer the identity of nodes
   using the graph learning technique based on Graph Convolutional
   Networks. Furthermore, a series of enhancement has been proposed by
   exploiting unique features of blockchain transaction graph. The
   experimental results on Ethereum transaction records show that I(2)GL
   significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Automatic modulation classification (AMC) of underwater acoustic
   communication signals is of great significance in national defense and
   marine military. Accurate modulation classification methods can make
   great contributions to accurately grasping the parameters and
   characteristics of enemy communication systems. While a poor underwater
   acoustic channel makes it difficult to classify the modulation types
   correctly. Feature extraction and deep learning methods have proven to
   be effective methods for the modulation classification of underwater
   acoustic communication signals, but their performance is still limited
   by the complex underwater communication environment. Graph convolution
   networks (GCN) can learn the graph structured information of the data,
   making it an effective method for processing structured data. To improve
   the stability and robustness of AMC in underwater channels, we combined
   the feature extraction and deep learning methods by fusing the
   multi-domain features and deep features using GCN. The proposed method
   takes the relationships among the different multi-domain features and
   deep features into account. Firstly, a feature graph was built using the
   properties of the features. Secondly, multi-domain features were
   extracted from the received signals and deep features were extracted
   from the signals using a deep neural network. Thirdly, we constructed
   the input of GCN using these features and the graph. Then, the
   multi-domain features and deep features were fused by the GCN. Finally,
   we classified the modulation types using the output of GCN by way of a
   softmax layer. We conducted the experiments on a simulated dataset and a
   real-world dataset, respectively. The results show that the AMC based on
   GCN can achieve a significant improvement in performance compared to the
   current state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is robust in underwater
   acoustic channels.

AB To handle more challenging operation security problems in today's power
   system, pre-fault transient stability assessment (TSA) is essentially
   required to promote the awareness of the system stability risks. Fast
   and analyzable data-driven methods draw much attention in intelligent
   TSA schemes, but most of them either lack generalization to various
   operation topologies and fault locations, or fail to operate on
   developing systems with changeable scales. Some schemes based on graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) enjoy promising topology learning but
   suffer from poor scale reduction, which affects the robustness against
   system-scale changes. With this in mind, we propose a novel
   Attention-based Hierarchical Dynamic grAph Pooling nEtwork (AH-DAPE),
   where a graph-based hierarchical pooling strategy is initiated for
   effective scale reduction in power systems. The expressive power of
   hierarchical pooling is enhanced by a spectral unsupervised loss related
   to power system simplification, while the temporal learning across
   dynamic coarsened graphs are enabled by integration of inter-graph
   convolution and mean/maximum operations. Test results on small IEEE 39
   Bus system and large IEEE 300 Bus system validate our scheme's
   superiority over existing TSA models and robustness against various
   operation scenarios, especially when applied to new system scales.

   problems remain in existing GCN-based methods, and the problem of low

   method that combines video data and skeleton data. The two networks
   respectively identify skeleton data and video data and fuse the
   probabilities of the two outputs to achieve the effect of information
   fusion. Experiments on two large dataset, Kinetics and NTU-RGBC+D Human

AB Most graph convolutional network (GCN)-based social recommendation
   frameworks fuse social links with user-item interactions to enrich user
   representations, which alleviate the cold-start problem and data
   sparsity problem. However, GCN-based recommender systems still suffer
   from two limitations. First, Excessive reliance on social graphs to
   extract user interests for rating predictions is unreliable due to
   social inconsistency. Second, GCN-based models suffer from
   over-smoothing problems, node embeddings become more similar when going
   deeper to enable larger receptive fields. To address the two
   aforementioned problems simultaneously, we propose a Deep Adaptive
   Collaborative Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation
   (DUI-SoRec). First, the graph generation module decomposes the user-item
   interaction to generate two subgraphs: an u2u graph and an i2i graph.
   Secondly, the graph learning module utilizes a deep adaptive graph
   neural network to learn user and item embeddings on the two subgraphs
   and the existing social graph, while solving the over -smoothing
   problem. Finally, we designed a refined fusion module to aggregate the
   social graph and u2u graph to address the social inconsistency. We
   conducted extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and the
   results demonstrate the model's effectiveness.

AB The fine-grained task of emotion analysis, emotion cause extraction, is
   a current research hotspot. It aims to discover the underlying reasons
   behind the emotional expression in texts. Most of the existing work
   regards the task as an independent text clause classification problem,
   ignoring the relationship between the clauses and failing to use the
   indicative relationship between emotional sentences and emotional cause
   sentences. The existence of these problems greatly affects the accuracy
   of the task. In this work, an emotion cause extraction method based on a
   hierarchical network emotional assistance mechanism is proposed. This
   method uses a hierarchical network composed of bidirectional gated
   recurrent units, attention mechanism, and graph convolutional networks
   to capture clause context information, deep semantic information, and
   structural information between clause neighborhoods. At the same time,
   by enhancing the emotional information representation of the graph
   convolutional network nodes, the clause features of the text emotional
   keywords are introduced into the discovery of candidate cause sentences.
   Thus, a model of the deep neural network combined with the emotional
   assistance mechanism is established. Compared with the existing methods,
   the model established in this paper has better classification
   performance on the Chinese emotion cause dataset.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a family of neural network
   models that perform inference on graph data by interleaving vertexwise
   operations and message-passing exchanges across nodes. Concerning the
   latter, two key questions arise: 1) how to design a differentiable
   exchange protocol (e.g., a one-hop Laplacian smoothing in the original
   GCN) and 2) how to characterize the tradeoff in complexity with respect
   to the local updates. In this brief, we show that the state-of-the-art
   results can be achieved by adapting the number of communication steps
   independently at every node. In particular, we endow each node with a
   halting unit (inspired by Graves' adaptive computation time [1]) that
   after every exchange decides whether to continue communicating or not.
   We show that the proposed adaptive propagation GCN (AP-GCN) achieves
   superior or similar results to the best proposed models so far on a
   number of benchmarks while requiring a small overhead in terms of
   additional parameters. We also investigate a regularization term to
   enforce an explicit tradeoff between communication and accuracy. The
   code for the AP-GCN experiments is released as an open-source library.

AB Most existing object detection models are restricted to detecting
   objects from previously seen categories, an approach that tends to
   become infeasible for rare or novel concepts. Accordingly, in this
   paper, we explore object detection in the context of zero-shot learning,
   i.e., Zero-Shot Object Detection (ZSD), to concurrently recognize and
   localize objects from novel concepts. Existing ZSD algorithms are
   typically based on a strict mapping-transfer strategy that suffers from
   a significant visual-semantic gap. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel
   Semantics-Preserving Graph Propagation model for ZSD based on Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCN). More specifically, we develop a graph
   construction module to flexibly build category graphs by leveraging
   diverse correlations between category nodes; this is followed by two
   semantics-preserving graph propagation modules that enhance both
   category and region representations. Benefiting from the multi-step
   graph propagation process, both the semantic description and structural
   knowledge exhibited in prior category graphs can be effectively
   leveraged to boost the generalization capability of the learned
   projection function. Experiments on existing seen/unseen splits of three
   popular object detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
   performs favorably against state-of-the-art ZSD methods.

AB Game theory can employ reinforcement learning algorithms to identify the
   optimal policy or equilibrium solution. Potential-based reward shaping
   (PBRS) methods are prevalently used for accelerating reinforcement
   learning, ensuring the optimal policy remains consistent. Existing PBRS
   research performs message passing based on graph convolution neural
   networks (GCNs) to propagate information from rewarding states. However,
   in an irreversible time-series reinforcement learning problem,
   undirected graphs will not only mislead message-passing schemes but also
   lose a distinctive direction structure. In this paper, a novel approach
   called directed graph convolution neural networks for reward shaping phi
   DCN has been proposed to tackle this problem. The key innovation of phi
   DCN is the extension of spectral-based undirected graph convolution to
   directed graphs. Messages can be efficiently propagated by leveraging a
   directed graph Laplacian as a substitute for the state transition
   matrix. As a consequence, potential-based reward shaping can then be
   implemented by the propagated messages. The incorporation of temporal
   dependencies between states makes phi DCN more suitable for real-world
   scenarios than existing potential-based reward shaping methods based on
   undirected graph convolutional networks. Preliminary experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed phi DCN exhibits a substantial improvement
   compared to other competing algorithms on both Atari and MuJoCo
   benchmarks.

AB Previous speech emotion recognition (SER) methods normally deal with
   variable-length utterance inputs by padding shorter ones or clipping
   longer ones into equal-length utterances, which may introduce invalid
   information or discard useful emotional segments. To address this issue,
   in this paper, we cast the SER problem into a graph classification task
   by transforming variable-length utterances into graphs to avoid padding
   or cutting. In our approach, frames (short windowed segments) in an
   utterance are presented as nodes in a graph. Acoustic features extracted
   from frames are treated as node feature vectors and nodes are connected
   according to their temporal relationship. Different graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) are explored for node/frame embedding learning, and
   kinds of graph pooling methods are compared to obtain
   graph/utterance-level emotional representation from node embeddings.
   Extensive experiments with different GCN components and pooling
   mechanisms are conducted on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPRO datasets. The
   experimental results show that a combination of GraphSAGE with
   multi-head attention pooling (MHAPool) achieves the best weighted
   accuracy (WA) and comparable unweighted accuracy (UA) on both datasets
   compared with other state-of-the-art SER models, which demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed graph-based network for SER task. (C) 2022

AB Analyzing the vulnerability of power systems in cascading failures is
   generally regarded as a challenging problem. Although existing studies
   can extract some critical rules, they fail to capture the complex
   subtleties under different operational conditions. In recent years,
   several deep learning methods have been applied to address this issue.
   However, most of the existing deep learning methods consider only the
   grid topology of a power system in terms of topological connections, but
   do not encompass a power system's spatial information such as the
   electrical distance to increase the accuracy in the process of graph
   convolution. In this paper, we construct a novel power-weighted line
   graph that uses power system topology and spatial information to
   optimize the edge weight assignment of the line graph. Then we propose a
   multi-graph convolutional network (MGCN) based on a graph classification
   task, which preserves a power system's spatial correlations and captures
   the relationships among physical components. Our model can better handle
   the problem with power systems that have parallel lines, where our
   method can maintain desirable accuracy in modeling systems with these
   extra topology features. To increase the interpretability of the model,
   we present the MGCN using layer-wise relevance propagation and quantify
   the contributing factors of model classification.

AB Graph convolutional network has been extensively employed in
   semi-supervised classification tasks. Although some studies have
   attempted to leverage graph convolutional networks to explore multi-view
   data, they mostly consider the fusion of feature and topology
   individually, leading to the underutilization of the consistency and
   complementarity of multi-view data. In this paper, we propose an
   end-to-end joint fusion framework that aims to simultaneously conduct a
   consistent feature integration and an adaptive topology adjustment.
   Specifically, to capture the feature consistency, we construct a deep
   matrix decomposition module, which maps data from different views onto a
   feature space obtaining a consistent feature representation. Moreover,
   we design a more flexible graph convolution that allows to adaptively
   learn a more robust topology. A dynamic topology can greatly reduce the
   influence of unreliable information, which acquires a more adaptive
   representation. As a result, our method jointly designs an effective
   feature fusion module and a topology adjustment module, and lets these
   two modules mutually enhance each other. It takes full advantage of the
   consistency and complementarity to better capture the more intrinsic
   information. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses
   state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification methods.

AB Message passing neural networks such as graph convolutional networks
   (GCN) can jointly consider various types of features for social bot
   detection. However, the expressive power of GCN is upper-bounded by the
   1st-order Weisfeiler-Leman isomorphism test, which limits the detection
   performance for the social bots. In this paper, we propose a subgraph
   encoding based GCN model, SEGCN, with stronger expressive power for
   social bot detection. Each node representation of this model is computed
   as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph rather than encoding
   of immediate neighbors only. Extensive experimental results on two
   publicly available datasets, Twibot-20 and Twibot-22, showed that the
   proposed model improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art social bot
   detection models by around 2.4%, 3.1%, respectively.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has become a hotspot in graph-based
   machine learning due to its powerful graph processing capability. Most
   of the existing GCN-based approaches are designed for single-view data.
   In numerous practical scenarios, data is expressed through multiple
   views, rather than a single view. The ability of GCN to model
   homogeneous graphs is indisputable, while it is insufficient in facing
   the heterophily property of multi-view data. In this paper, we revisit
   multi-view learning to propose an implicit heterogeneous graph
   convolutional network that efficiently captures the heterogeneity of
   multi-view data while exploiting the powerful feature aggregation
   capability of GCN. We automatically assign optimal importance to each
   view when constructing the meta-path graph. High-order cross-view
   meta-paths are explored based on the obtained graph, and a series of
   graph matrices are generated. Combining graph matrices with learnable
   global feature representation to obtain heterogeneous graph embeddings
   at various levels. Finally, in order to effectively utilize both local
   and global information, we introduce a graph-level attention mechanism
   at the meta-path level that allocates private information to each node
   individually. Extensive experimental results convincingly support the
   superior performance of the proposed method compared to other
   state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Acid leachate from steel sludge was used as a source of zinc oxide
   (ZnO-L) for the preparation of photo -catalytically active composites
   based on GO/ZnO-L and g-C3N4/ZnO-L (further denoted as gCN/ZnO-L). The
   prepared composites were characterized using UV-Vis spectrophotometry,
   SBET, XRD, FTIR and DRS. The photocatalytic efficiency was tested using
   the photodegradation of azo dye Acid Orange 7. The obtained results were
   confronted with model composites prepared from pure components. For
   GO/ZnO-L and gCN/ZnO-L sam-ples, the degradation efficiency was found to
   be 60.2 % and 51.5 %, respectively. While in the case of gCN/ZnO-L
   composites, it was purely photochemical degradation, in the case of
   GO/ZnO-L composites adsorption was significantly co-applied. For both
   composites containing ZnO-L, a higher photo-degradation activity against
   azo dye was found compared to the model composites. The reason is the
   modification of the electronic structure and the emergence of new
   quantum levels between the valence band and the conduction band of ZnO
   and gCN due to the presence of other metal oxides in ZnO-L, which leads
   to a more efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers.

AB Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a promising technique in representation
   learning on graph data. Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Graph
   Attention Network (GAT) are two main representative techniques in GNN,
   which can learn node embedding on the graph by aggregating the embedding
   of the neighborhoods. However, the complex computation process of
   existing GCN and GAT makes them less effective for tasks with complex
   graph structures. Moreover, traditional GCN and GAT ignore the time
   factor in user representation learning, so the obtained user preference
   model is static and cannot reflect the dynamics of user preferences. In
   this work, we propose a time-aware Lightweight Graph Convolutional
   Attention Network (LightGCAN), which can capture static and dynamic user
   preferences efficiently by using different GNN strategies. Specifically,
   static user preferences are modeled by a GCN with only neighborhood
   aggregation, and dynamic user preferences are extracted by a time-aware
   GAT based on recently interacted items. Static and dynamic user
   preferences are then combined and fed into a dual-channel Deep Neural
   Network (DNN) model for feature interaction learning and matching score
   prediction. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that
   LightGCAN is superior to the SOTA recommendation method.

AB BackgroundSpinal cord injury (SCI) may lead to impaired motor function,
   autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and other dysfunctions.
   Brain-computer Interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery (MI) can
   provide more scientific and effective treatment solutions for SCI
   patients. MethodsAccording to the interaction between brain regions, a
   coherence-based graph convolutional network (C-GCN) method is proposed
   to extract the temporal-frequency-spatial features and functional
   connectivity information of EEG signals. The proposed algorithm
   constructs multi-channel EEG features based on coherence networks as
   graphical signals and then classifies MI tasks. Different from the
   traditional graphical convolutional neural network (GCN), the C-GCN
   method uses the coherence network of EEG signals to determine MI-related
   functional connections, which are used to represent the intrinsic
   connections between EEG channels in different rhythms and different MI
   tasks. EEG data of SCI patients and healthy subjects have been analyzed,
   where healthy subjects served as the control group. ResultsThe
   experimental results show that the C-GCN method can achieve the best
   classification performance with certain reliability and stability, the
   highest classification accuracy is 96.85%. ConclusionThe proposed
   framework can provide an effective theoretical basis for the
   rehabilitation treatment of SCI patients.

AB Urban functional zones (UFZs) contain abundant landscape information
   that can be adopted to better understand the surroundings. Various
   landscape compositions and configurations reflect different human
   activities, which may affect the particulate matter (PM2.5)
   concentrations. The very high -resolution (VHR) image features can
   reflect the physical and spatial structures of the UFZs. However, the
   existing PM2.5 estimation methods neither have been based on the scale
   of UFZs, nor have the VHR image features of UFZs as independent
   vari-ables. Hence, this article proposes a spatiotemporal interpolation
   graph convolutional network (STI-GCN) model and introduces VHR image
   features to achieve PM2.5 estimation in UFZs. First, UFZs are split, and
   VHR image features are extracted by the visual geometry group 16
   (VGG16). Subsequently, meteorological factors, aerosol optical depth
   (AOD), and VHR image features are used to estimate the PM2.5
   concentrations at the scale of the UFZs. The two metropolises, Beijing
   and Shanghai, are chosen to assess the validity of the STI-GCN model. As
   for Beijing and Shanghai, the overall accuracy R-2 of the STI-GCN model
   can reach 0.96 and 0.89, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are 8.15
   and 6.40 mu g/m(3), the mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 5.51 and 4.78 mu
   g/m(3), and the relative prediction errors (RPEs) are 18.53% and 17.38%,
   respectively. Experiments show that the STI-GCN consistently outperforms
   other models. What's more, the PM2.5 values are relatively high in
   commercial and official zones (COZs) and relatively low in urban green
   zones (UGZs).

AB Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and can be divided into several
   subtypes with unique prognostic and molecular characteristics. The
   classification of breast cancer subtypes plays an important role in the
   precision treatment and prognosis of breast cancer. Benefitting from the
   relation-aware ability of a graph convolution network (GCN), we present
   a multi-omics integrative method, the attention-based GCN (AGCN), for
   breast cancer molecular subtype classification using messenger RNA
   expression, copy number variation and deoxyribonucleic acid methylation
   multi-omics data. In the extensive comparative studies, our AGCN models
   outperform state-of-the-art methods under different experimental
   conditions and both attention mechanisms and the graph convolution
   subnetwork play an important role in accurate cancer subtype
   classification. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) algorithm is
   used for the interpretation of model decision, which can identify
   patient-specific important biomarkers that are reported to be related to
   the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Our results highlighted
   the effectiveness of the GCN and attention mechanisms in multi-omics
   integrative analysis and the implement of the LRP algorithm can provide
   biologically reasonable insights into model decision.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) have been widely used in the field of
   skeleton-based action recognition and have achieved exciting results.
   Introducing attention mechanism in the process of extracting skeleton
   features has always been a hot spot in GCN-related research. In this
   article, we design a new graph convolutional network, which combines the
   advanced decoupling graph convolutional network (DC-GCN) with spatial,
   temporal, channel (STC) series attention module and adaptive
   normalization (AN). The STC attention module helps the network tend to
   extract important information from skeleton features. In addition, in
   order to improve the adaptability of the normalization method to GCN, we
   design the AN module instead of the BN module, which can train the
   weights of different normalization methods, so that each normalization
   layer in the network adopts the most suitable normalization operation.
   The experimental results show that the accuracy of our method is
   competitive with the state-of-the-art action recognition methods.

AB Blockchain technology has generated an influx of transaction data and
   complex interactions, posing significant challenges for traditional
   machine learning methods, which struggle to capture high-dimensional
   patterns in transaction networks. In this paper, we present the
   disentangled prototypical graph convolutional network (DP-GCN), an
   innovative approach to account classification in Ethereum transaction
   records. Our method employs a unique disentanglement mechanism that
   isolates relevant features, enhancing pattern recognition within the
   network. Additionally, we apply prototyping to disentangled
   representations, to classify scam nodes robustly, despite extreme class
   imbalances. We further employ a joint learning strategy, combining
   triplet loss and prototypical loss with a gamma coefficient, achieving
   an effective balance between the two. Experiments on real Ethereum data
   showcase the success of our approach, as the DP-GCN attained an F1 score
   improvement of 32.54%p over the previous best-performing GCN model and
   an area under the ROC curve (AUC) improvement of 4.28%p by incorporating
   our novel disentangled prototyping concept. Our research highlights the
   importance of advanced techniques in detecting malicious activities
   within large-scale real-world cryptocurrency transactions.

AB Finding new enzyme variants with the desired substrate scope requires
   screening through a large number of potential variants. In a typical in
   silico enzyme engineering workflow, it is possible to scan a few
   thousands of variants, and gather several candidates for further
   screening or experimental verification. In this work, we show that a
   Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) can be trained to predict the
   binding energy of combinatorial libraries of enzyme complexes using only
   sequence information. The GCN model uses a stack of message-passing and
   graph pooling layers to extract information from the protein input graph
   and yield a prediction. The GCN model is agnostic to the identity of the
   ligand, which is kept constant within the mutant libraries. Using a
   miniscule subset of the total combinatorial space (204-208 mutants) as
   training data, the proposed GCN model achieves a high accuracy in
   predicting the binding energy of unseen variants. The network's accuracy
   was further improved by injecting feature embeddings obtained from a
   language module pretrained on 10 million protein sequences. Since no
   structural information is needed to evaluate new variants, the deep
   learning algorithm is capable of scoring an enzyme variant in under 1
   ms, allowing the search of billions of candidates on a single GPU.

AB The increasing integration of Inverter Interfaced Distributed Generators
   (IIDGs) into distribution networks has led to a more active nature of
   the grid. However, the accuracy-speed trade-off caused by iterative
   algorithms and simplified models in the short-circuit current
   calculation method for active distribution networks (ADNs) is becoming
   more prominent. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that
   utilizes Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) for short-circuit
   current calculation in ADNs. Our study explores the characteristics of
   short-circuit current in different network structures and evaluates the
   feasibility of representing electrical quantities using a graph data
   format. The proposed method employs the GCN model to calculate
   multi-output ADN short-circuit current and investigates the block
   construction of the GCN model. Algorithm analysis demonstrates that our
   method effectively calculates network-wide short-circuit current under
   various network structures, IIDG penetration rates, and fault
   conditions, meeting both accuracy and computational speed requirements.
   The proposed method offers several advantages, including superior
   precision, rapid computation, minimal hardware resource utilization, and
   robust resistance to interference.

AB Clustering is a basic task of data analysis and decision making.
   Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) based deep clustering
   frameworks have produced the state-of-the-art performance. However, the
   traditional GCN has not fully learnt the structural information of the
   neighbors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an attention-based
   hierarchical denoised deep clustering (AHDDC) algorithm to solve the
   problem, which enables GCN to learn multiple layers of hidden
   information and uses the attention mechanism to strengthen the
   information. Besides, we use a denoising autoencoder to reduce the
   influence of the data noise on the clustering. In AHDDC, Firstly, we
   input the feature vector of the original data into a denoising
   autoencoder (DAE) to learn the hidden representation; secondly, the
   representation information of the autoencoder and the structure
   information constructed by the KNN graph are passed into a hierarchical
   attentional graph convolutional network; finally, a self-supervision
   module is used to optimize the clustering results. Experimental results
   show the superiorities of our method over most advanced algorithms.
   Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical, attention based
   and denoising improving strategies are also verified experimentally.

AB Due to the prevailing trend of globalization, the competition for social
   employment has escalated significantly. Moreover, the job market has
   become exceedingly competitive for students, warranting immediate
   attention. In light of this, a novel prognostic model employing big data
   technology is proposed to facilitate a bilateral employment scenario for
   graduates, aiding college students in promptly gauging the prevailing
   social employment landscape and providing precise employment guidance.
   Initially, the focus lies in meticulously analyzing pivotal aspects of
   college students' employment by constructing a specialized employment
   platform. Subsequently, a classification model grounded in a graph
   convolution network (GCN) is built, leveraging big data technology to
   comprehensively comprehend graduates' strengths and weaknesses in the
   employment milieu. Furthermore, based on the outcomes derived from the
   comprehensive classification of college students' qualities, a college
   students' employment trend prediction method employing long and short
   term memory (LSTM) is proposed. This method supplements the analysis of
   graduates' employability and enables accurate forecasting of college
   students' employment trends. Empirical evidence substantiates that my
   proposed methodology effectively evaluates graduates' comprehensive
   qualities and successfully predicts their employment prospects. The
   achieved F-values, 82.45% and 69.89%, respectively, demonstrate the
   efficacy of anticipating the new paradigm in graduates' dual-line
   employment.

AB Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in intelligent

   of traffic control and urban planning. Due to the complexity of road
   traffic flow data, traffic flow prediction has been one of the
   challenging tasks to fully exploit the spatiotemporal characteristics of

   characteristics is proposed. First, a GCN model is employed to capture
   the topological structure of the data graph and extract the spatial
   features of road networks. Additionally, due to the capability to handle
   long-term dependencies, the longterm memory is used to predict the time
   series of traffic flow and extract the time features. The proposed model
   is evaluated using real-world data, which are obtained from the
   intersection of Liuquan Road and Zhongrun Avenue in the Zibo High-Tech
   Zone of China. The results show that the developed combined GCNLSTM flow
   direction level traffic flow prediction model can perform better than
   the single models of the LSTM model and GCN model, and the combined
   ARIMA-LSTM model in traffic flow has a strong spatiotemporal
   correlation.

AB The photocatalytic performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is
   improved by the introduction of mo-lybdenum disulfide (MoS2) quantum
   dots (QDs), aiming the enhanced visible light absorbance in resultant 2
   -dimensional g-C3N4/MoS2, termed as GCN/MoS2 hereafter. A novel
   synthetic approach i.e., pseudo-successive ionic layer adsorption and
   reaction (p-SILAR) was employed to deposit MoS2 QDs on g-C3N4 and to
   salvage 2 -dimensional MoS2 concomitantly. The results of the
   photocatalytic activity affirm that GCN/MoS2 worked as a better
   photocatalyst than the pure g-C3N4, while salvaged MoS2 also showed
   reasonable degradation of Rhodamine-B (RhB) dye. The average pore size
   (measured with BET analysis) of GCN/MoS2 was reduced to 31.91 nm from
   33.11 nm (for g-C3N4), indicating effectual nanoscale deposition of MoS2
   which resulted in a decrease in the overall bandgap alignment of the
   composite from 2.8 eV to 2.2 eV. In-depth material charac-terization and
   photocatalytic analysis was carried out to affirm that p-SILAR serves as
   a suitable synthesis route for the development of GCN/MoS2 nanocomposite
   as well as salvaged MoS2.

AB Early recognition of abnormal gait enables physicians to determine a
   prompt rehabilitation plan for patients for the most effective treatment
   and care. The Kinect depth sensor can easily collect skeleton data
   describing the position of joints in the human body. However, the
   default human skeleton model of Kinect includes an excessive number of
   many joints, which limits the accuracy of the gait recognition methods
   and increases the computational resources required. In this study, we
   propose an optimized human skeleton model for the Kinect system and
   streamline the joints using a center-of-mass calculation. We integrate
   several techniques to propose an end-to-end, spatial-temporal, joint
   attention graph convolutional network (STJA-GCN) architecture. We
   conducted experiments with a fivefold cross-validation on two common
   datasets of information on abnormal gaits to evaluate the performance of
   the proposed method. The results show that the STJA-GCN achieved 93.17
   and 92.08% accuracy on the two datasets, and compared to the original
   spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), the recognition
   accuracy increases by 9.22 and 20.65%, respectively. Overall, the
   results demonstrate that the STJA-GCN can accurately recognize abnormal
   gaits and, thus, can support low-cost rehabilitation assessments at
   community hospitals or in patients' homes.

   (AgCFN). Composite with graphitic carbon nitride (AgCFN@gCN) was

   crystal violet (coloured compound) and benzimidazole (colourless
   compound) under sunlight. Various physiochemical methods such as
   UV-Visible, XRD, SEM, and FT-IR spectroscopy were employed for the
   characterization of prepared samples. XRD was used for structural
   characterization. The prepared nanomaterials were sized up to be < 09
   nm. FT-IR spectroscopy was exploited for the functional group
   characterization. Surface morphology was perceived through Scanning
   Electron Microscope. Optical analysis was carried out using a UV-Visible
   spectrophotometer. The photodegradation efficiencies for crystal violet
   and benzimidazole were ascertained to be in the order of CFN < AgCFN <
   AgCFN@gCN, under sunlight. Among the synthesized photocatalysts,
   AgCFN@gCN was discovered to have the highest photocatalytic degradation
   efficiency of 52.72% and 84.21% for benzimidazole and crystal violet,
   respectively. The higher catalytic activity of AgCFN@gCN can be
   associated with its high surface area and the presence of active sites
   of the gCN sheets. Role of electrons (e(-)), holes (h(+)), and hydroxyl
   radicals (OH & lowast;) in the photocatalytic activity was also
   assessed.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with the powerful capacity to explore
   graph-structural data has gained noticeable success in recent years.
   Nonetheless, most of the existing GCN-based models suffer from the
   notorious over-smoothing issue, owing to which shallow networks are
   extensively adopted. This may be problematic for complex graph datasets
   because a deeper GCN should be beneficial to propagating information
   across remote neighbors. Recent works have devoted effort to addressing
   over-smoothing problems, including establishing residual connection
   structure or fusing predictions from multi-layer models. Because of the
   indistinguishable embeddings from deep layers, it is reasonable to
   generate more reliable predictions before conducting the combination of
   outputs from various layers. In light of this, we propose an Alternating
   Graph-regularized Neural Network (AGNN) composed of Graph Convolutional
   Layer (GCL) and Graph Embedding Layer (GEL). GEL is derived from the
   graph-regularized optimization containing Laplacian embedding term,
   which can alleviate the over-smoothing problem by periodic projection
   from the low-order feature space onto the high-order space. With more
   distinguishable features of distinct layers, an improved Adaboost
   strategy is utilized to aggregate outputs from each layer, which
   explores integrated embeddings of multi-hop neighbors. The proposed
   model is evaluated via a large number of experiments including
   performance comparison with some multi-layer or multi-order graph neural
   networks, which reveals the superior performance improvement of AGNN
   compared with state-of-the-art models.

AB Graph convolution networks (GCNs) play an increasingly vital role in
   recommender systems, due to their remarkable relation modeling and
   representation capabilities. Concretely, they can capture high-order
   semantic correlations within sparse bipartite interaction graphs,
   thereby enhancing user-item collaborative encodings. Despite the
   exciting prospects, the existing GCN-based models mainly focus on
   user-item interactions and seldom consider effectiveness of the side
   item co-occurrence information on user behavior guidance, resulting in
   limited performance improvement. Therefore, we propose a novel side item
   co-occurrence information-aware GCN model. Specifically, we first
   decouple the original heterogeneous relation graph into corresponding
   user-item and item-item subgraphs for user-item interaction and item
   co-occurrence relation modeling. Thereafter, we conduct adaptive
   iterative aggregation on these subgraphs for user intention
   understanding and co-occurring item correlation perception. Finally, we
   present two semantic fusion strategies for sufficient user-item semantic
   collaborative learning, thereby boosting the overall recommendation
   performance. Extensive comparison experiments are conducted on three
   benchmark datasets to justify the superiority of our model.

AB The future detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from a Galactic
   core-collapse supernova will provide information on the physics inside
   protoneutron stars (PNS). In this work, we apply three different
   classification methods for the PNS non-radial oscillation modes: Cowling
   classification, Generalized Cowling Nomenclature (GCN), and a
   classification based on modal properties (CBMP). Using PNS models from
   3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae, we find that in the early
   stages of the PNS evolution, typically 0.4 s after the bounce, the
   Cowling classification is inconsistent, but the GCN and the CBMP provide
   complementary information that helps to understand the evolution of the
   modes. In the GCN, we note several avoided crossings as the mode
   frequencies evolve at early times, while the CBMP tracks the modes
   across the avoided crossings. We verify that the strongest emission of
   GWs by the PNS corresponds to the f mode in the GCN, indicating that the
   mode trapping region alternates between the core and the envelope at
   each avoided crossing. At later times, approximately 0.4 s after the
   bounce, the three classification methods present a similar description
   of the mode spectrum. We use our results to test universal relations for
   the PNS modes according to their classification and find that the
   behaviour of the universal relations for f and p modes is remarkably
   simple in the CBMP.

   Chickpea using both in vitro and in vivo studies (pot study). The root

AB Dense granule proteins (GRAs) are secreted by Apicomplexa protozoa,
   which are closely related to an extensive variety of farm animal
   diseases. Predicting GRAs is an integral part in prevention and
   treatment of parasitic diseases. Considering that biological experiment
   approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational method is
   a superior choice. Hence, developing an effective computational method
   for GRAs prediction is of urgency. In this paper, we present a novel
   computational method named GRA-GCN through graph convolutional network.
   In terms of the graph theory, the GRAs prediction can be regarded as a
   node classification task. GRA-GCN leverages k-nearest neighbor algorithm
   to construct the feature graph for aggregating more informative
   representation. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize
   computational approach for GRAs prediction. Evaluated by 5-fold
   cross-validations, the GRA-GCN method achieves satisfactory performance,
   and is superior to four classic machine learning-based methods and three
   state-of-the-art models. The analysis of the comprehensive experiment
   results and a case study could offer valuable information for
   understanding complex mechanisms, and would contribute to accurate
   prediction of GRAs. Moreover, we also implement a web server at
   http://dgpd.tlds.cc/GRAGCN/index/, for facilitating the process of using
   our model.

AB A potential replacement for two-dimensional (2D)-inorganic
   semiconductors in photocatalysis has developed quickly in the form of
   graphitic carbon nitride [g-C3N4 (GCN)], a 2D-organic semiconductor;
   nevertheless, very few investigations have been conducted to date about
   its use in optoelectronic devices. In light of the demands of
   light-emitting diodes (LED) with effective injected carrier
   recombination, we propose the report on the fabrication of B-doped
   exfoliated g-C3N4 (BEGCN) with substantially altered optical/electronic
   characteristics and a unique structural backbone and illustrate their
   potential applications in LED devices. The role of exploitation and
   boron incorporation toward modulating the optical properties of GCN was
   studied. BEGCN has very high photoluminescence (PL); EGCN and GCN
   exhibit vanishingly low PL and 2.67 and 2.73 eV smaller bandgap than
   BEGCN (E-g = 2.81 eV) and manifest visibly white emission. An
   interesting electronic structure derived from the native defect states
   of hBN and p, p*, and n states of GCN is bestowed by the occurrence of
   these two distinct domain types in BEGCN nanosheets. The BEGCN
   nanosheets demonstrate distinctive optical features in PL emission,
   which makes the material incredible for the development of
   high-performance LEDs. The photocatalytic performance was also carried
   out to correlate the PL characteristics with light-induced RhB
   degradation of GCN (93%), EGCN (86%), and BEGCN (82%) within 180 min.
   Degradation efficiency decreased due to the boron incorporation, which
   directly affects the absorption of photons by creating a blocking effect
   between the catalyst surface and the light source. Next-generation
   light-emitting and display devices featuring exceptional luminescence
   stability may be possible with the construction of BEGCN nanosheets with
   doped EGCN and B-nanodomains and the emergence of outstanding
   light-emission properties.

AB OPC is a very time consuming process for mask synthesis. Quick and
   accurate OPC using GCN with layout encoder and mask decoder is proposed.
   (1) GCN performs a series of aggregation with MLP for correction
   process. A feature of a particular polygon is aggregated with weighted
   features of neighbor polygons; this is a key motivation of using GCN
   since one polygon should be corrected while its neighbors are taken into
   account for more accurate correction. (2) GCN inputs are provided by a
   layout encoder, which extracts a feature from each layout polygon. GCN
   outputs, features corresponding to corrected polygons, are processed by
   a mask decoder to yield the final mask pattern. (3) The encoder and
   decoder originate from respective autoencoders. High fidelity of decoder
   is a key for OPC quality. This is achieved by collective training of the
   two autoencoders with a single loss function while the encoder and
   decoder are connected. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed OPC
   achieves 47% smaller EPE than OPC using a simple MLP model.

AB The growing risk of death associated with kidney dysfunction underlines
   the requirement for a cost-effective and precise point-of-care (POC)
   diagnostic tool to identify chronic kidney disease (CKD) at an early
   stage. This work reports the development of a non-invasive POC
   diagnostic based on cost-efficient, disposable electrodes and in
   situ-designed biomimetic nanozymes. The nanozymes are composed of
   graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (gCN) and creatinine-imprinted
   polythiophene nanofibers (miPTh). Microscopic analyses reveal porous
   nanofibrous surface morphology of biomimetic miPTh/gCN nanozymes. Bulk
   imprinting and the inclusion of conductive gCN nanosheets drastically
   reduced the charge transfer resistance and improved the electron
   exchange kinetics at the nanozyme-electrolyte interface. The
   electrochemical oxidation of creatinine is studied via cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), which
   exhibit excellent creatinine recognition ability of bio-mimetic
   miPTh/gCN nanozyme sensors compared to pristine polymeric or
   non-imprinted nanozymes. The sensor reveals linear response toward
   200-1000 nmol L-1 creatinine, high sensitivity (4.27 mu A cm-2 nmol-1
   L), sub-nanomolar detection limit (340 pmol L-1), and excellent
   selectivity over common salivary analytes. To corroborate its real-world
   utility, the miPTh/gCN nanozyme sensor shows an impressive 94.8%
   recovery of spiked creatinine concentrations in microliter droplets of
   human saliva samples. This disposable sensor reveals great potential in
   the realm of reliable and efficient non-invasive POC diagnostics for
   healthcare delivery.

AB The state of charge (SoC) of a vehicle battery can tend to vary
   depending on the driver's driving patterns and circumstances. To
   accurately predict the SoC level, it is necessary to consider various
   circumstances. That is why traditional statistical models may not be
   sufficient. To address this issue, recurrent neural network (RNN) models
   have been proposed for time series prediction tasks due to their
   superior performance. In this paper, we propose a new approach using a
   graph convolutional network (GCN)-based model that shows better
   performance than RNN-based models. The GCN requires an adjacency matrix
   as input, which represents the relationships between variables. We set
   this matrix to be learnable during model training rather than
   predefined. We also use two different adjacency matrices: one with
   variables as nodes, and the other with timestamps as nodes, to enhance
   the interpretability of the data by considering different elements as
   nodes. This allows the model to interpret the data from different
   perspectives. The proposed GCN model was tested using real-world
   electric vehicle (EV) data and demonstrated improved performance
   compared to RNN-based baselines. In addition, the GCN model has
   advantage of being able to clearly express the relationships between
   variables in a graph, improving interpretabilty.

AB The past few years have seen the dramatic adoption of the Internet of
   Things (IoT) in everyday life, from manufacturing to healthcare. With
   the emergence of various new Internet of Things applications, it is a
   challenging problem to meet the different QoS requirements of Internet
   of Things applications in shared substrate networks. Recently, Network
   Virtualization (NV) has attracted a large amount of attention from
   academia and industry. NV enables multiple virtual networks to coexist
   on the same substrate network, thus providing IoT users with customized
   end-to-end services. The main challenge of NV is the Virtual Network
   Embedding (VNE) problem, which refers to embed different virtual
   networks into one substrate network. Inspired by the recent success of
   graph convolutional network (GCN) in graph structured data processing,
   in this paper, we propose a GCN aided VNE algorithm. The GCN can extract
   high-order spatial structure information among substrate nodes through
   the convolution kernel. Considering that the training data of VNE has no
   label, we introduce the policy gradient algorithm to optimize the GCN
   model. In addition, three evaluation metrics are designed to evaluate
   the performance of the network embedding policy. Some simulations are
   implemented to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to the
   other state-of-the-art solutions.

AB With the construction of a new-type power system under the China "double
   carbon" target and the increasing diversification of the energy demand
   on the user side, the short-term load forecasting of the power system is
   facing new challenges. To fully exploit the massive information
   contained in data, based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) and
   long short-term memory network (LSTM), this paper presents a new
   short-term load forecasting method for power systems considering
   multiple factors. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to
   analyse the correlation between load and meteorological factors, and a
   model including meteorology, dates, and regions was established.
   Secondly, GCN and LSTM are jointly used to extract the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of massive data, respectively, and finally
   achieve short-term power load prediction. Historical electrical load
   data from 2020 to 2022 public data of a real industrial park in southern
   China were selected to verify the validity of the proposed method from
   the aspects of forecasting accuracy, feature dimension, and training
   time.

AB Incipient faults for analogue circuits in modern electronic systems are
   difficult to diagnose due to poor fault features. To address this issue,
   a method based on the attention weighted graph convolution network
   (Att-GCN) is proposed in this paper. The structural and data features of
   samples are jointly extracted to mine the effective characteristics from
   incipient faults. First, a wavelet packet energy transform and a
   probabilistic principal component analysis (ProbPCA) are employed to
   enhance the sample fault information. Then, the distance clustering
   method is deployed to construct the sample set into a non-European
   structure sample graph, where the structural features of fault samples
   are preserved. Second, an Att-GCN, which combines the spatial-domain
   graph convolution network and improved self-attention mechanism, is
   constructed to extract the structural features and data features to
   obtain more effective fault information. Additionally, the multisample
   dropout method is introduced to reduce network overfitting in the
   training process. To assess the method's actual performance for fault
   diagnosis, experiments are carried out in the Sallen-Key bandpass filter
   circuit, the four-op-amp biquadratic filter circuit and the amplifier
   board circuit. The outcomes indicate that this method improves the
   incipient fault diagnosis accuracy for analogue circuits.

AB The upstream and downstream dependence of air traffic flow networks
   (ATFN) is a key step in identifying the changing characteristics and
   interaction patterns of air traffic flow. This requires mining the flow
   state and operation information of en route flights from multiple
   angles. However there have been challenges in terms of methodology and
   practical application. In this study, we propose a hybrid model which
   combines fuzzy c-means (FCM) and graph convolution network (GCN) for air
   traffic dependence. Practice has proven that the ATFN graph structure
   generated by clustering trajectory data using FCM can clearly reflect
   crossing points and mainstream paths. The GCN is used to detect the
   trajectory deviation, time delay, and tolerance of the ATFN at different
   times or paths and visualise the output characteristic layer, which can
   effectively identify the temporal and spatial correlation of the flow
   state. Experimental results on real data show that FCM-GCN is
   significantly better than other baseline models in medium-and long-term
   traffic prediction tasks. It achieved its best performance in the 60-min
   traffic prediction compared with existing methods. The experimental
   results in the selected case area propose a general research framework
   on the upstream and downstream dependence of ATFN and reflect the
   efficiency of the organisation and differentiation of ATFN. Its
   integration with air traffic flow management is conducive to the
   optimisation of highly interconnected and interdependent flow networks.

AB Photocatalysisis an effective technology to convert solar energyinto
   chemical energy, which has attracted great attention for thedegradation
   of water pollutants and the hydrogen production by watersplitting. The
   nonmetallic polymer g-C3N4 (GCN)can meet the thermodynamic conditions of
   photocatalytic water splitting,but its performances are not satisfying
   due to its narrow light absorptionrange and high recombination rate of
   photogenerated charge carriers.Among metal sulfide semiconductors, Ag-In
   sulfide quantum dots(AIS QDs), such as AgInS2, show excellent visible
   lightabsorption and promising photoactivity. In this work, AIS
   QDs-modifiedGCN is synthesized by an in situ growth method in mild
   conditions.The photocatalytic activity of the AIS-QDs/GCN nanocomposite
   is notablyhigher than that of the pure phase g-C3N4. Especially,the
   sample containing 10 wt % AIS QDs has the best activity in
   bothtetracycline degradation and hydrogen generation, reaching 48.5%
   degradationefficiency in 1 h of visible light exposure (3.2 times that
   of GCN)and a hydrogen evolution rate of 62.3 & mu;mol & BULL;g(-1)&
   BULL;h(-1) (that of bare GCN being negligible).The optical and
   photoelectrochemical characterization highlights theinterplay between
   the two components, suggesting that the enhancedphotocatalytic activity
   of AIS-QDs/GCN is mainly due to the broadeningof the light absorption
   range, the acceleration of charge transfer,and the reduction of the
   carrier pair recombination rate due to theformation of a type-II
   heterojunction inside the composite catalyst.This work is among the
   first attempts to modify g-C3N4 with polysulfide quantum dots to improve
   its catalytic performance,and the results provide an important step for
   advances in the applicationof these systems.

AB Most bacterial disinfectants contain high levels of extremely toxic and
   environmental hazardous chemicals, which pose a significant threat to
   the ecosystem. Semiconductor photocatalysis exhibits attractive
   prospects as an emerging greener technology for waste water
   disinfection. However, the fast recombination of charge carriers limits
   its practical application. Herein, self-assembled polymeric feather-like
   g-C3N4 (GCN) nanosheets modified with ferromagnetic CuFe2O4 (CFO)
   nanospheres were successfully applied as a reusable visible light photo
   catalytic disinfectant. As expected, the g-C3N4/CuFe2O4 (GCF) nanohybrid
   displayed superior photocatalytic inactivation efficiency of 0.157log
   within 120 min towards Escherichia coli DH5 alpha (E. coli) compared
   with pristine GCN and CFO. The characterization results revealed the
   synergistic heterostructure interfaces, high surface area, and the
   transformative self-assembly of GCN to feather-like structure providing
   a rich active site for improved charge separation efficiency, and wide
   spectral response, therefore the superior performance of GCF. The
   radical trapping assay proclaimed that both O2 center dot-and center dot
   OH radical played major role in the photocatalytic inactivation among
   the other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), protein estimation, and DNA estimation assay
   results validated the cell damage caused by the photocatalyst. Besides
   that, GCN showed applicability in real-time wastewater samples with
   improved efficiency than in the saline solution. The excellent magnetic
   characteristics facilitated the recycling of the catalyst with
   insignificant leaching, magnetic induction, and distinguished
   separation. The results of this work signify the well-designed GCF as a
   highperformance and reusable photocatalyst for real-world pathogenic
   bacterial disinfection operations.

   GO/Fe-GCN reached 96.5% and equilibrium was 83.6% for Rhodamine B. The
   GO component not only enhanced the adsorption but also provided a higher

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) will be widely used in all areas of life
   and transportation as the 5th Generation (5G) communication technology
   matures and becomes commercially available. Especially in the field of
   railway transportation, the IoT technology can alleviate the challenge
   caused by insufficient wireless spectrum resources and improve the
   railway communication performance. However, the existing IoT is made up
   of a large heterogeneous network. In such a super-dense heterogeneous
   network scenario, how to allocate the most appropriate access point (AP)
   according to the needs of users has become a problem demanding prompt
   solution, which also brings additional challenges for the intelligent
   transportation system (ITS) to develop green and efficient network
   communication technology. Therefore, focusing on the selection and

   studies the spatial characteristics of the intelligent spectrum
   situation of the Internet of Mobile Things in the railway scenario, and
   establishes the opportunistic access situation of Railway IoT based on

AB Herein, we report synthesis of Ni0.5-Co0.5Fe2O4 (NCF),
   CuxNi0.5-Co0.5Fe2-xO4 where x = 0.6 (CNCF) via co-precipitation followed
   by annealing, and its composite with g-C3N4 (CNCF@gCN) via
   ultra-sonication tech-nique. The spectral and structural characteristics
   of the manufactured samples were assessed by applying a variety of
   characterization methods. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated
   that both the NCF and CNCF samples has a cubic crystal structure. The
   use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) successfully
   verified the existence of functional groups and vibrational modes inside
   the mixed spinel ferrites. The objective of this study was to assess the
   photocatalytic efficacy of the synthesized samples by the degradation of
   rhodamine B (Rh-B) dye and pendimethalin (PDM) herbicide using
   photocatalysis. The CNCF@gCN materials demonstrate significantly
   enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison to both NCF and CNCF
   counterparts when used for the degradation of Rh-B and PDM. Moreover,
   Charge transfer resistance and flat band potential for all samples were
   also calculated via electrochemical measurements. The photocatalysts,
   namely Bare NCF, doped CNCF, and CNCF@gCN nanocomposite, exhibited
   degradation efficiencies of 48%, 75%, and 92% for Rh-B, and 41%, 52%,
   and 86% for PDM, respectively, when exposed to solar light for a
   duration of 105 min. The high photocatalytic activity of CNCF@gCN
   nanocomposite is due to presence of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)
   which provide large surface area and prevent electron-hole pair
   recombination. In addition, recyclability experiment was also performed
   to determine the stability of CNCF@gCN nanocomposite. The catalyst's
   remarkable chemical stability made it possible to regenerate and remove
   it from the dye without losing its photocatalytic efficiency.

AB Anatomical resection (AR) based on anatomical sub-regions is a promising
   method of precise surgical resection, which has been proven to improve
   long-term survival by reducing local recurrence. The fine-grained
   segmentation of an organ's surgical anatomy (FGS-OSA), i.e., segmenting
   an organ into multiple anatomic regions, is critical for localizing
   tumors in AR surgical planning. However, automatically obtaining FGS-OSA
   results in computeraided methods faces the challenges of appearance
   ambiguities among sub-regions (i.e., inter-sub-region appearance
   ambiguities) caused by similar HU distributions in different sub-regions
   of an organ's surgical anatomy, invisible boundaries, and similarities
   between anatomical landmarks and other anatomical information. In this
   paper, we propose a novel fine-grained segmentation framework termed the
   "anatomic relation reasoning graph convolutional network" (ARR-GCN),
   which incorporates prior anatomic relations into the framework learning.
   In ARR-GCN, a graph is constructed based on the sub-regions to model the
   class and their relations. Further, to obtain discriminative initial
   node representations of graph space, a sub-region center module is
   designed. Most importantly, to explicitly learn the anatomic relations,
   the prior anatomic-relations among the sub-regions are encoded in the
   form of an adjacency matrix and embedded into the intermediate node
   representations to guide framework learning. The ARR-GCN was validated
   on two FGS-OSA tasks: i) liver segments segmentation, and ii) lung lobes
   segmentation. Experimental results on both tasks outperformed other
   state-of-the-art segmentation methods and yielded promising performances
   by ARR-GCN for suppressing ambiguities among sub-regions.

AB As a natural extension of link prediction on graphs, hyperlink
   prediction aims for the inference of missing hyperlinks in hypergraphs,
   where a hyperlink can connect more than two nodes. Hyperlink prediction
   has applications in a wide range of systems, from chemical reaction
   networks and social communication networks to protein-protein
   interaction networks. In this article, we provide a systematic and
   comprehensive survey on hyperlink prediction. We adopt a classical
   taxonomy from link prediction to classify the existing hyperlink
   prediction methods into four categories: similarity-based,
   probability-based, matrix optimization-based, and deep learning-based
   methods. To compare the performance of methods from different
   categories, we perform a benchmark study on various hypergraph
   applications using representative methods from each category. Notably,
   deep learning-based methods prevail over other methods in hyperlink
   prediction.

AB In this manuscript "Feed two birds with one seed" strategy was followed
   to study the electrochemical ability and photocatalytic Degradation of
   pharmaceutical effluent nimesulide (NIM) drugs. Heterogeneous
   solid-direct Z -scheme catalysts experienced many efforts in generating
   new materials to tackle environmental issues by exhibiting appropriate
   catalysts. Currently, graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) with its unique
   characteristics has attracted tremendous kindness among researchers due
   to its excellent potential for utilization as a bi-functional catalyst.
   In this research, the part of surface morphological engineering and band
   gap evolution in heterojunction solid-direct Z-scheme formation of
   vanadium and phosphorous doped gCN (V/P-gCN (VP)) will be considered.
   The proposed material is prepared by thermal decomposition and the
   analytical analysis was utilized to study the physio-chemical
   characteristics. These newly developed strategies are more useful to
   enhance the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity of gCN. In
   addition, specific information on the application of gCN-based catalysts
   in the bi-functional simultaneous process will be obtained in different
   reactions. The analytical parameters of the proposed sensor were
   adequate, with higher recovery values, and the detection limits and
   quantification range are 0.2 - 80 mu M and 3 nM, respectively for the
   detection of NIM. Photocatalytic Degradation of NIM targets harmful
   pollutants obtained 98% within a short treatment time under visible
   light illumination. In addition, the possible degradation pathways of
   NIM drugs were studied using GC-MS analysis, which exhibited the
   degra-dation of NIM molecules with small fragments. These
   dual-functional approaches could provide sustainable and efficient
   strategies for both electro and photocatalyst to rectify environmental
   issues.

AB Classification methods that are based on hyperspectral images (HSIs) are
   playing an increasingly significant role in the processes of target
   detection, environmental management, and mineral mapping as a result of
   the fast development of hyperspectral remote sensing technology.
   Improving classification performance is still a sig-nificant problem,
   however, as a result of the high dimensionality and redundancy of
   hyperspectral image sets (HSIs), as well as the presence of class
   imbalance in hyperspectral datasets. In the past few years,
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs) have achieved good results in HSI classifi-cation, but CNNs
   struggle to achieve good accuracy in low samples, while GCNs have a huge
   computational cost. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a
   Multi-Feature Fusion of 3D-CNN and Graph Attention Network MFFCG. The
   algorithm consists of two elements: the 3D-CNN, which produces good
   classification for 3D HSI cube data, and GAT-based encoder and decoder
   modules that help in improving the classification accuracy of the 3D
   -CNN. Finally, the multiple features are merged with the help of two
   neural network models. We further develop two optimized GAT models named
   GAT1 and GAT2, which are used with different layers of 3D-CNN.
   Algorithms after merging with 3D-CNN are named MFFCG-1 and MFFCG-2,
   which produce better classification results then other developed
   methods. Experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed
   methods perform better than other state-of-the-art methods using the
   limited training samples and in low classification time.

AB Knowledge tracing models have gained prominence in educational data
   mining, with applications like the Self-Attention Knowledge Tracing
   model, which captures the exercise-knowledge relationship. However,
   conventional knowledge tracing models focus solely on static
   question-knowledge and knowledge-knowledge relationships, treating them
   with equal significance. This simplistic approach often succumbs to
   subjective labeling bias and lacks the depth to capture nuanced
   exercise-knowledge connections. In this study, we propose a novel
   knowledge tracing model called Knowledge Relation Rank Enhanced
   Heterogeneous Learning Interaction Modeling for Neural Graph Forgetting
   Knowledge Tracing. Our model mitigates the impact of subjective labeling
   by fine-tuning the skill relation matrix and Q-matrix. Additionally, we
   employ Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to capture intricate
   interactions between students, exercises, and skills. Specifically, the
   Knowledge Relation Importance Rank Calibration method is employed to
   generate the skill relation matrix and Q-matrix. These calibrated
   matrices, alongside heterogeneous interactions, serve as input for the
   GCN to compute exercise and skill embeddings. Subsequently, exercise
   embeddings, skill embeddings, item difficulty, and contingency tables
   collectively contribute to an exercise relation matrix, which is then
   fed into an attention mechanism for predictions. Experimental
   evaluations on two publicly available educational datasets demonstrate
   the superiority of our proposed model over baseline models, evidenced by
   enhanced performance across three evaluation metrics.

AB BackgroundUltrasound plays a critical role in the early screening and
   diagnosis of cancers. Although deep neural networks have been widely
   investigated in the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of different medical
   images, diverse ultrasound devices, and image modalities pose challenges
   for clinical applications, especially in the recognition of thyroid
   nodules having various shapes and sizes. More generalized and extensible
   methods need to be developed for the cross-devices recognition of
   thyroid nodules. PurposeIn this work, a semi-supervised graph
   convolutional deep learning framework is proposed for the domain
   adaptative recognition of thyroid nodules across several ultrasound
   devices. A deep classification network, trained on a source domain with
   a specific device, can be transferred to recognize thyroid nodules on
   the target domain with other devices, using only few manual annotated
   ultrasound images. MethodsThis study presents a semi-supervised
   graph-convolutional-network-based domain adaptation framework, namely
   Semi-GCNs-DA. Based on the ResNet backbone, it is extended in three
   aspects for domain adaptation, that is, graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs) for the connection construction between source and target
   domains, semi-supervised GCNs for accurate target domain recognition,
   and pseudo labels for unlabeled target domains. Data were collected from
   1498 patients comprising 12 108 images with or without thyroid nodules
   under three different ultrasound devices. Accuracy, Sensitivity and
   Specificity were used for the performance evaluation. ResultsThe
   proposed method was validated on six groups of data for a single source
   domain adaptation task, the mean Accuracy was 0.9719 +/- 0.0023, 0.9928
   +/- 0.0022, 0.9353 +/- 0.0105, 0.8727 +/- 0.0021, 0.7596 +/- 0.0045,
   0.8482 +/- 0.0092, which achieved better performance in comparison with
   the state-of-the-art. The proposed method was also validated on three
   groups of multiple source domain adaptation tasks. In particular, when
   using X60 and HS50 as the source domain data, and H60 as the target
   domain, it can achieve the Accuracy of 0.8829 +/- 0.0079, Sensitivity of
   0.9757 +/- 0.0001, and Specificity of 0.7894 +/- 0.0164. Ablation
   experiments also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules.
   ConclusionThe developed Semi-GCNs-DA framework can effectively recognize
   thyroid nodules on different ultrasound devices. The developed
   semi-supervised GCNs can be further extended to the domain adaptation
   problems for other modalities of medical images.

AB Urban road networks have complex spatial and temporal correlations,
   driving a surge of research interest in spatial-temporal traffic flow
   prediction. However, prior approaches often overlook the temporal-scale
   differentiation of spatial-temporal features, limiting their ability to
   extract complex structural information. In this work, we design the
   multibranch adaptive fusion graph convolutional network (MBAF-GCN) that
   explicitly exploits the prior spatial-temporal characteristics at
   different temporal scales, and each branch is responsible for extracting
   spatial-temporal features at a specific scale. Besides, we design the
   spatial-temporal feature fusion (STFF) module to refine the prediction
   results. Based on the multibranch complementary features, the module
   adopts a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy, incorporating different
   spatial-temporal scale features to obtain recalibrated prediction
   results. Finally, we evaluate the MBAF-GCN using two real-world traffic
   datasets. Experimentally, the newly designed multibranch can
   efficaciously utilize the prior information of different temporal
   scales. Our MBAF-GCN achieved better performance in the comparative
   model, indicating its potential and validity.

AB Objective: HIV infection risk can be estimated based on not only
   individual features but also social network information. However, there
   have been insufficient studies using n machine learning methods that can
   maximize the utility of such information. Leveraging a state-of-the-art
   network topology modeling method, graph convolutional networks (GCN),
   our main objective was to include network information for the task of
   detecting previously unknown HIV infections.
   Materials and Methods: We used multiple social network data (peer
   referral, social, sex partners, and affiliation with social and health
   venues) that include 378 young men who had sex with men in Houston, TX,
   collected between 2014 and 2016. Due to the limited sample size, an
   ensemble approach was engaged by integrating GCN for modeling
   information flow and statistical machine learning methods, including
   random forest and logistic regression, to efficiently model sparse
   features in individual nodes.
   Results: Modeling network information using GCN effectively increased
   the prediction of HIV status in the social network. The ensemble
   approach achieved 96.6% on accuracy and 94.6% on F1 measure, which
   outperformed the baseline methods (GCN, logistic regression, and random
   forest: 79.0%, 90.5%, 94.4% on accuracy, respectively; and 57.7%, 80.2%,

   produced promising results.
   Conclusion: Network context is a necessary component in modeling
   infectious disease transmissions such as HIV. GCN, when combined with
   traditional machine learning approaches, achieved promising performance
   in detecting previously unknown HIV infections, which may provide a
   useful tool for combatting the HIV epidemic.

AB The intermolecular interactions between proteins and ligands occur
   through site-specific amino acid residues in the proteins, and the
   identification of these key residues plays a critical role in both
   interpreting protein function and facilitating drug design based on
   virtual screening. In general, the information about the ligands-binding
   residues on proteins is unknown, and the detection of the binding
   residues by the biological wet experiments is time consuming. Therefore,
   many computational methods have been developed to identify the
   protein-ligand binding residues in recent years. We propose GraphPLBR, a
   framework based on Graph Convolutional Neural (GCN) networks, to predict
   protein-ligand binding residues (PLBR). The proteins are represented as
   a graph with residues as nodes through 3D protein structure data, such
   that the PLBR prediction task is transformed into a graph node
   classification task. A deep graph convolutional network is applied to
   extract information from higher-order neighbors, and initial residue
   connection with identity mapping is applied to cope with the
   over-smoothing problem caused by increasing the number of graph
   convolutional layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is a more
   unique and innovative perspective that utilizes the idea of graph node
   classification for protein-ligand binding residues prediction. By
   comparing with some state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better
   on several metrics.

AB In the field of environmental science, traditional methods for
   predicting PM2.5 concentrations primarily focus on singular temporal or
   spatial dimensions. This approach presents certain limitations when it
   comes to deeply mining the joint influence of multiple monitoring sites
   and their inherent connections with meteorological factors. To address
   this issue, we introduce an innovative deep-learning-based multi-graph
   model using Beijing as the study case. This model consists of two key
   modules: firstly, the 'Meteorological Factor Spatio-Temporal Feature
   Extraction Module'. This module deeply integrates spatio-temporal
   features of hourly meteorological data by employing Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spatial and
   temporal encoding respectively. Subsequently, through an attention
   mechanism, it retrieves a feature tensor associated with air pollutants.
   Secondly, these features are amalgamated with PM2.5 concentration
   values, allowing the 'PM2.5 Concentration Prediction Module' to predict
   with enhanced accuracy the joint influence across multiple monitoring
   sites. Our model exhibits significant advantages over traditional
   methods in processing the joint impact of multiple sites and their
   associated meteorological factors. By providing new perspectives and
   tools for the in-depth understanding of urban air pollutant distribution
   and optimization of air quality management, this model propels us
   towards a more comprehensive approach in tackling air pollution issues.

AB A deep learning-based multi-output prediction model is developed to
   better understand and more accurately estimate tunnel boring machine
   (TBM) performance in each segment ring during the deep excavation under
   complex underground environments. The novelty lies in the development of
   a new deep learning approach named att-GCN, which feasibly integrates
   the graph convolutional networks (GCN) and scaled dot-product attention
   mechanism to improve model performance and interpretability. It is
   proved that our proposed attGCN model is outstanding in significantly
   enhancing the prediction performance and effectively capturing the
   influence between monitoring points. As a case study, the proposed
   method is validated in a Singapore Mass Rail Transit (MRT) construction
   project, where seven features associated with the TBM machine are input
   for att-GCN training and testing. Experimental results reveal that the
   att-GCN model can exhibit a powerful capability in simultaneously
   predicting two targets named penetration rate (y1) and energy
   consumption (y2), reaching the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
   value at 15.475% and 15.173%, respectively. In terms of prediction
   accuracy, att-GCN is superior to some state-of-the-art algorithms,
   including deep neural network (DNN), random forest (RF), and support
   vector regression (SVR). Moreover, an online-learning version of att-GCN
   is designed. When the objective value is gradually known and fed into
   att-GCN during the tunneling procedure, the model can yield more
   impressive performance under the MAPE of 8.504% (y1) and 7.934% (y2).
   Accordingly, the real-time estimation of TBM performance based on the
   time-varying monitoring data provides valuable evidence to realize the
   intelligent control of TBM tunneling, which can ultimately improve
   construction efficiency and reliability.

AB MoS2/gCN/graphene ternary nanocomposites were synthesized using the
   ultrasonication-assisted calcination method, and different amounts of
   gCN were loaded to prepare the ternary nanocomposites. The hybrid MoS2/
   gCN/graphene ternary nanocomposites showed significant responses to an
   incident light source, and electrochemical analysis indicated that the
   junctions of the rose-like MoS2, metal-free gC3N4, and 2D graphene
   positively changed the electronic structure without changing the
   internal crystal and electronic structures of each unary nanocomposite,
   thus offering an effective separation of the electron-hole pairs.
   Therefore, this process provides abundant photoinduced electrons for
   CO2/CH3OH and holes for the water oxidation reactions, which can in turn
   be employed for the photoreduction of CO2. In addition, the
   charge-carrier mechanism of the ternary nanocomposites was labeled as
   type-II heterojunction. The use of an aqueous solvent with a basic salt
   and donor scavenger enhanced the Type-II heterojunction photocatalytic
   CO2 reduction because of the efficient supply of hydrated CO2 molecules
   and the large number of electrons required for the complex reduction
   reaction of CO2 to alcohol. Control of the external and internal factors
   for photocatalytic CO2 reduction further increased the selectivity for
   the reduction of CO2 and CH3OH. This work demonstrates the successful
   integration of gCN, graphene, and rose-like MoS2 with enhanced catalytic
   activity. Moreover, this work is expected to be of great importance in
   the development of photocatalyst materials for CO2 reduction while
   allowing advanced tunable chemical and structural properties of the
   metal-free gCN and rose-like MoS2.

AB Tackling traffic signal control through multi-agent reinforcement
   learning is a widely-employed approach. However, current
   state-of-the-art models have drawbacks: intersections optimize their own
   local rewards and cause traffic to waste time and fuel with a start-stop
   mode at each intersection. They also lack information sharing among
   intersections and their specialized policy hinders the ability to adapt
   to new traffic scenarios. To overcome these limitations, This work
   presents a centralized collaborative graph network (CCGN) with the core
   objective of a signal-free corridor once the traffic flows have waited
   at the entry intersection of the traffic intersection network on either
   side, the subsequent intersection gives the open signal as the traffic
   flows arrive. CCGN combines local policy networks (LPN) and global
   policy networks, where LPN employed at each intersection predicts
   actions based on Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In
   contrast, GPN is based on GCN and Q-network that receives the LPN
   states, traffic flow and road information to manage intersections to
   provide a signal-free corridor. We developed the Deep Graph Convolution
   Q-Network (DGCQ) by combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and GCN to achieve a
   signal-free corridor. DGCQ leverages GCN's intersection collaboration
   and DQN's information aggregation for traffic control decisions Proposed
   CCGN model is trained on the robust synthetic traffic network and
   evaluated on the real-world traffic networks that outperform the other
   state-of-the-art models. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by

AB Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has recently become a promising data
   acquisition paradigm, which recruits a large number of users to collect
   data from the target sensing areas. Obviously, with the increase of
   sensing scale and the decrease of sensing granularity, traditional MCS
   cannot fully cover the required sensing areas especially the
   inaccessible areas. As a variant, Sparse MCS can utilize the
   spatiotemporal correlations in sensing data to infer the whole sensing
   map only by sensing a few subareas. However, in many real-world
   scenarios, such as traffic congestion prediction or parking occupancy
   detection, inferring the current unsensed data may not be the final
   goal. By comparison, it is more important to get the future information
   through the sparse sensed data. In this paper, we turn attention from
   inferring the current unsensed data to predicting the future unknown
   data and propose an urban inference and prediction framework in Sparse
   MCS. To deal with the sparse sensed data, we first present a
   bipartite-graph-based matrix completion algorithm with spatiotemporal
   constraints to accurately recover the current full map. Then, by
   exploiting spatiotemporal correlations based on the inferred full map,
   we present a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with spatiotemporal
   attention to predict the future maps. Furthermore, we design a
   spatiotemporal iterative method to repeatedly update the spatiotemporal
   attentions and constraints, in order to connect the urban inference and
   prediction to improve the accuracy of the whole framework. Extensive
   experiments have been conducted on two types of typical urban sensing
   tasks with four real-world data sets, which verify the effectiveness of
   our proposed algorithms in improving the inference and prediction
   accuracy with the sparse sensed data.

AB A plethora of information is now readily available for traffic
   prediction, making an effective use of them enables better traffic
   planning. With data coming from multiple sources, and their features
   spanning spatial and temporal dimensions, there is an increasing demand
   to exploit them for accurate traffic prediction. Existing methods,
   however, do not provide a solution for this, as they tend to require
   expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a general
   architecture for SpatioTemporal Data Fusion (STDF) with parameter
   efficiency. To make heterogeneous multi-source data fusion
   effectiveness, we separate all data into traffic directly related data
   and traffic indirectly related data. With traffic indirectly related
   data as the input to Spatial Embedding by Temporal convolutiON (SETON)
   that simultaneously encodes each feature in both space and time
   dimensions and traffic directly related data as the input to the graph
   convolutional network(GCN), we designed a fine-grained feature
   transformer to match the ones generated by GCN. This is then followed by
   a fusion module to combine all features to make final prediction.
   Compared to using GCNs training with only traffic directly related data,
   experimental results show that our model can achieve a 6.1 & x0025;
   improvement in prediction accuracy measured by Root Mean Squared Error.

AB It is meaningful but challenging to teach machines to recognize
   handwritten Chinese characters. However, conventional approaches
   typically view handwritten Chinese characters as either static images or
   tempo-ral trajectories, which may ignore the inherent geometric
   semantics of characters. Instead, here we first propose to represent
   handwritten characters as skeleton graphs, explicitly considering the
   natural charac-teristics of characters (i.e., characters as graphs).
   Furthermore, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Trans-former (PyGT) to
   specifically process the graph-structured characters, which fully
   integrates the advan-tages of Transformers and graph convolutional
   networks. Specifically, our PyGT can learn better graph fea-tures
   through (i) capturing the global information from all nodes with graph
   attention mechanism and (ii) modelling the explicit local adjacency
   structures of nodes with graph convolutions. Furthermore, the PyGT
   learns the multi-resolution features by constructing a progressive
   shrinking pyramid. Compared with ex-isting approaches, it is more
   interpretable to recognize characters as geometric graphs. Moreover, the
   pro-posed method is generic for both online and offline handwritten
   Chinese character recognition (HCCR), and it also can be feasibly
   extended to handwritten text recognition. Extensive experiments
   empirically demonstrate the superiority of PyGT over the prevalent
   approaches including 2D-CNN, RNN/1D-CNN, and Vision Transformer (ViT)
   for HCCR. The code is available at https://github.com/ganji15/PyGT-HCCR

AB Multi-label image recognition has been an indispensable fundamental
   component for many real computer vision applications. However, a severe
   threat of privacy leakage in multi-label image recognition has been
   overlooked by existing studies. To fill this gap, two privacy-preserving
   models, Privacy-Preserving Multi-label Graph Convolutional Networks
   (P2-ML-GCN) and Robust P2-ML-GCN (RP2-ML-GCN), are developed in this
   article, where differential privacy mechanism is implemented on the
   model's outputs so as to defend blackbox attack and avoid large
   aggregated noise simultaneously. In particular, a regularization term is
   exploited in the loss function of RP2-ML-GCN to increase the model
   prediction accuracy and robustness. After that, a proper differential
   privacy mechanism is designed with the intention of decreasing the bias
   of loss function in P2-ML-GCN and increasing prediction accuracy.
   Besides, we analyze that a bounded global sensitivity can mitigate
   excessive noise's side effect and obtain a performance improvement for
   multi-label image recognition in our models. Theoretical proof shows
   that our two models can guarantee differential privacy for model's
   outputs, weights and input features while preserving model robustness.
   Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the
   advantages of our proposedmodels, including the implementation of
   differential privacy on model's outputs, the incorporation of
   regularization term into loss function, and the adoption of bounded
   global sensitivity for multi-label image recognition.

AB Relations between entities evolving through discrete time-steps can be
   represented by discrete-time dynamic graphs. Examples include hourly
   interactions between social network users or daily infection spreading.
   In this paper, we present Dynamic Graph Echo State Network (DynGESN), a
   reservoir computing model for the efficient processing of discrete-time
   dynamic temporal graphs. We prove a sufficient condition for the echo
   state property, which ensures that graph embeddings are independent of
   initial conditions, and we briefly analyze reservoir dynamics. DynGESN
   is compared against temporal graph kernels (TGKs) on twelve graph
   classification tasks, and against ten different end-to-end trained
   temporal graph convolutional networks (TGNs) on four vertex regression
   tasks, since TGKs are limited to graph-level tasks. Compared to TGKs
   that need to hold the entire history of vertex interactions, our model
   provides a vector encoding for the dynamic graph that is updated at each
   time-step without requiring training. Experiments show that our model

AB Through accurate network-wide traffic prediction, network operators can
   agilely manage resources and improve robustness by proactively adapting
   to new traffic patterns, especially for traffic engineering, capacity
   planning and quality of service provisioning. However, due to the
   proliferation of backbone network traffic as well as the complexity and
   dynamics of network communication behavior, accurate and effective
   network-wide traffic prediction is challenging. To address the
   challenges, this paper focuses on short-term traffic matrix (TM)
   prediction in large-scale IP backbone networks. In order to improve the
   prediction performance, a novel spatiotemporal graph convolutional
   recurrent network (SGCRN)-a deep learning framework that incorporates
   both spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic flows, is proposed to
   implement TM prediction with high accuracy and efficiency. By learning
   network-wide traffic as graph-structured TM time series, SGCRN jointly
   utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCN) and gated recurrent units
   (GRU) networks to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal correlations
   among traffic flows. Specifically, SGCRN employs GCNs to identify
   structural spatial features of traffic flows by considering topological
   properties, and utilizes GRUs to implement temporal features learning by
   considering short and long-term dynamics of traffic flows. Extensive
   experimental results on the inter-Points of Presence network traffic
   data from four real IP backbone networks show that SGCRN can effectively
   predict short-term network-wide TM with superior accuracy compared with
   other four widely used traffic prediction methods.

AB Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have been widely applied to
   many real-world problems and have achieved better results. To improve
   the accuracy of GCN in the three-dimensional human pose estimation (3D
   HPE) task, improved semantic GCNs (SimpreRxSkip-NonCam-SemGCN and
   SPRA-SemGCN) are proposed. For the problem of insufficiently utilizing
   effective information in 3D HPE tasks, the dual- layer attention
   mechanism module (NonCam-attention) of extracting information is
   proposed. It establishes a spatial and channel-based fusion structure
   model by capturing the distance dependencies between different joint
   nodes of human poses and the associated features between different
   mapping channels. To reduce the training time and GPU memory for the
   preaggregated semantic graph convolutional networks (Pre-SemGCN) model,
   the simplified Pre-SemGCN module (Simpre-SemGCN) is suggested, which can
   accelerate the training speed of the model by eliminating the nonlinear
   activation layer. Further, a nested recursive expansion-based residual
   connection module (RxSkip + LN) is proposed to adjust the ratio of input
   and output with fewer parameters. To verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed model, we conduct experiments on the dataset Human 3.6M. The
   results show that the SPRA-SemGCN model proposed can effectively reduce
   the error of the 3D HPE task, and the mean per joint position error is
   finally reduced to 37.20 mm. (c) 2022 SPIE and IS&T

AB In recent years, privacy leakage events in large-scale social networks
   have become increasingly frequent. Traditional methods relying on
   operators have been unable to effectively curb this problem. Researchers
   must turn their attention to the privacy protection of users themselves.
   Privacy metrics are undoubtedly the most effective method. However,
   social networks have a substantial number of users and a complex network
   structure and feature set. Previous studies either considered a single
   aspect or measured multiple aspects separately and then artificially
   integrated them. The measurement procedures are complex and cannot
   effectively be integrated. To solve the above problems, we first propose
   using a deep neural network to measure the privacy status of social
   network users. Through a graph convolution network, we can easily and
   efficiently combine the user features and graph structure, determine the
   hidden relationships between these features, and obtain more accurate
   privacy scores. Given the restriction of the deep learning framework,
   which requires a large number of labelled samples, we incorporate a
   few-shot learning method, which greatly reduces the dependence on
   labelled data and human intervention. Our method is applicable to online
   social networks, such as Sina Weibo, Twitter, and Facebook, that can
   extract profile information, graph structure information of users'
   friends, and behavioural characteristics. The experiments show that our
   model can quickly and accurately obtain privacy scores in a whole
   network and eliminate traditional tedious numerical calculations and
   human intervention.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) including Graph Convolutional Networks
   (GCNs) have demonstrated state-ofthe-art performance in various
   analytical tasks. Current GNNs approaches focus on learning node
   representations based on the proximity similarity principle. However,
   they may fail to generalize to complex relations such as disassortative
   structure, because irrelevant information may be aggregated and generate
   unreasonable representations. To this end, this research introduces a
   novel approach - Graph neural networks via contrast between separation
   and aggregation for self and neighborhood, to effectively learn the node
   representations in the disassortative structure. To search friendly
   neighbor space with mitigating the unreasonable of connections, the
   proposed approach synthesizes the feature semantic space and the
   structure semantic space. To learn reasonable representations for
   disassortative graphs, the proposed approach stacks multiple GCNs and
   learns the intrinsic interrelationship between the optimal friendly
   aggregated information and the separated information originating from
   self and neighborhood by contrastive learning. At the same time, the
   proposed approach integrates the variational expectation maximization to
   train the whole framework for exploring the approximated posterior.
   Extensive experimental results on eight real-world graph datasets show
   that the proposed approach outperforms eight state-of-the-art GNN models
   in diverse graph mining tasks, including node classification and link
   prediction, demonstrating the proposed approach's superior graph
   representation ability.

AB In this paper, a new control architecture of virtual power plants (VPP)
   is proposed for the frequency regulation (FR) in main grid. Firstly, to
   address the power prediction of aggregation nodes (AN) with
   spatio-temporal correlation under VPP, a novel combined model based on
   graph convolutional networks and bi-directional long and short-term
   memory is established. Further, considering the effect of prediction
   uncertainty, a power shortage measurement method based on interval
   estimation is proposed to determine the effective power of AN. Secondly,
   a dispatch -based control strategy is introduced to enable VPP to
   respond to regulation commands from the main grid. Additionally, the
   influence of transmission line power loss on FR is considered, which can
   be eliminated by applying the developed power compensation design scheme
   based on proportional allocation. Finally, numerical simulations
   illustrate that the proposed method enhances prediction performance by
   68.65%, taking mean absolute error as an example, while ensuring the
   accuracy and reliability of power prediction. Also, the adopted control
   strategy can effectively utilize VPP to provide FR services for the main
   grid. Moreover, the application results in a real scene are better than
   those of benchmark methods, which also demonstrates that the proposed
   approach has a high practical application potential in power system.

AB Graph-structured scene descriptions can be efficiently used in
   generative models to control the composition of the generated image.
   Previous approaches are based on the combination of graph convolutional
   networks and adversarial methods for layout prediction and image
   generation, respectively. In this work, we show how employing multi-head
   attention to encode the graph information, as well as using a
   transformer-based model in the latent space for image generation can
   improve the quality of the sampled data, without the need to employ
   adversarial models with the subsequent advantage in terms of training
   stability. The proposed approach, specifically, is entirely based on
   transformer architectures both for encoding scene graphs into
   intermediate object layouts and for decoding these layouts into images,
   passing through a lower dimensional space learned by a vector-quantized
   variational autoencoder. Our approach shows an improved image quality
   with respect to state-of-the-art methods as well as a higher degree of
   diversity among multiple generations from the same scene graph. We
   evaluate our approach on three public datasets: Visual Genome, COCO, and
   CLEVR. We achieve an Inception Score of 13.7 and 12.8, and an FID of
   52.3 and 60.3, on COCO and Visual Genome, respectively. We perform
   ablation studies on our contributions to assess the impact of each
   component.

AB In this study, a novel spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks model
   is proposed for traffic flow prediction in urban road networks by fully
   considering an information geometry approach and attention-based
   mechanism. Accurate traffic flow prediction in real urban road networks
   is challenging due to the presence of dynamic spatiotemporal data and
   external factors in the urban environment. Moreover, the dynamic spatial
   and temporal dependencies of urban traffic flow data are very important
   for predicting traffic flow, and it has been shown that a recent
   attention mechanism has a relatively good ability to capture these
   dynamic dependencies, which are not fully considered by most existing
   algorithms. Therefore, in the novel model abbreviated as IGAGCN, the
   information geometry method is utilized to determine the dynamic data
   distribution difference between different sensors. The attention
   mechanism is employed with the information geometry method, in which a
   matrix is derived by analyzing the distributions of sensor data, and the
   spatiotemporal dynamic connections in traffic flow data features are
   better at capturing the spatial dependencies of traffic between
   different sensors in urban road networks. Furthermore, a parallel
   sub-model architecture is proposed to consider long time spans, where
   each dilated causal convolution sub-model is applied to short time
   spans. Two wellknown data sets were employed to demonstrate that our
   proposed method obtains better performance and is better at capturing
   the dynamic spatial dependencies of traffic than the existing
   only-attention based models. In addition a real-world urban road network
   in Shenzhen, China, was studied to test and verify the proposed model.

AB Knowledge graph (KG) can provide auxiliary information for recommender
   system to alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, while graph
   convolutional networks (GCN) has recently been established as the
   state-of-the-art representation learning method. The combination of them
   is a promising perspective to improve the performance of
   graph-structured recommendation. However, most of GCN-based
   recommendations focus on homogeneous graph or user/item-similarity
   graph, fail to fully make use of the complex and rich semantics between
   entities in heterogeneous knowledge graph. In this paper, we develop
   Hierarchical Attention Graph Convolutional Network Incorporating
   Knowledge Graph for Explainable Recommendation (HAGERec) to explore
   users' potential preferences from the high-order connectivity structure
   of heterogeneous knowledge graph. To exploit semantic information,
   HAGERec simultaneously learn the representations of users and items via
   a bi-directional information propagation strategy. Specifically, the
   entity's representation can be aggregated through messages passing from
   its local proximity structure, and a hierarchical attention mechanism is
   developed to adaptively characterize and adjust collaborative signals.
   With the help of the attention mechanism, an attentive entity sampling
   strategy is proposed to select relevant neighbor entities, and the
   explainability is endowed to the model by building knowledge-aware
   connectivity. Experiments conducted on four real-world public datasets
   demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and the strong

AB Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in employing graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) for various video analysis tasks where
   graph-based data abound. However, exploring the transferable knowledge
   between different graphs, which is a direction with wide and potential
   applications, has been rarely studied. To address this issue, we propose
   a graph interaction networks (GINs) model for transferring relation
   knowledge across two graphs. Different from conventional domain
   adaptation or knowledge distillation approaches, our GINs focus on a
   "self-learned" weight matrix, which is a higher-level representation of
   the input data. And each element of the weight matrix represents the
   pair-wise relation among different nodes within the graph. Moreover, we
   guide the networks to transfer the knowledge across the weight matrices
   by designing a task-specific loss function, so that the relation
   information is well preserved during transfer. We conduct experiments on
   two different scenarios for video analysis, including a new proposed
   setting for unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition across
   different datasets, and supervised group activity recognition with
   multi-modal inputs. Extensive experiments on six widely used datasets
   illustrate that our GINs achieve very competitive performance in
   comparison with the state-of-the-arts.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition is widely used due to its advantages
   of lightweight and strong anti-interference. Recently, graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to action recognition
   and have made breakthrough progress. The shift convolution operator can
   effectively replace the spatial convolution and greatly reduce the
   computational complexity of the algorithm. This article first applies
   the Conv-Shift-Conv (CSC) module and the Shift-Conv-Shift-Conv (SC2)
   module to replace the Shift-Conv-Shift (SCS) module in spatial graph
   convolution of Shift-GCN respectively. This design can reorder the
   shifted channels more effectively. The experimental results show that
   the CSC module has the best effect and effectively improves accuracy of
   model. After that, this article proposes to replace the shift module in
   the original Shift-GCN with a sparse shift module and named
   SparseShift-GCN. This structure can reduce the redundancy of features,
   prevent overfitting and improve the generality of the model. Based on
   the improvement in the previous step, better results have been achieved.
   Finally, this paper uses OHEM Loss and Weighted Loss to carefully design
   the loss function of the model and introduces it into the model proposed
   in this paper. Experimental results show that OHEM Loss further improves
   the accuracy of algorithm. After a series of improvements, our proposed
   model has improved the accuracy of 4 different streams to varying
   degrees, which improves the overall performance of the network. (C) 2021

AB Air pollution is a significant urban issue, with practical applications
   for pollution control, urban environmental management planning, and
   urban construction. However, owing to the complexity and differences in
   spatiotemporal changes for various types of pollution, it is challenging
   to establish a framework that can capture the spatiotemporal
   correlations of different types of air pollution and obtain high
   prediction accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning
   framework suitable for predicting various air pollutants: a graph
   convolutional temporal sliding long short-term memory (GT-LSTM) model.
   The hybrid integrated model combines graph convolutional networks and
   long short-term networks based on a strategy with temporal sliding.
   Herein, the graph convolution networks gather neighbor information for
   spatial dependency modeling based on the spatial adjacency matrices of
   different pollutants and the graph convolution operator with parameter
   sharing. LSTM networks with a temporal sliding strategy are used to
   learn dynamic air pollution changes for temporal dependency modeling.
   The framework was applied to predict the average concentrations of
   PM2.5, PM10, O-3, CO, SO2, and NO2 in the Bejing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)
   region for the next 24 hours. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed
   GT-LSTM model could extract high-level spatiotemporal features and
   achieve higher accuracy and stability than state-of-the-art baselines.
   Advancement in this methodology can assist in providing decision support
   capabilities to mitigate air quality issues.

AB Generally, seismic data have discontinuity or planar fracture anomalies
   in the volume of rocks, commonly known as seismic faults. A large number
   of methods exist to interpret seismic faults, nevertheless automating
   the process prevails to be a practical challenge. We propose a graph
   representation-based approach for interpreting faults in seismic data
   using the graph convolutional network (GCN). We extract 2D patches of
   data centered around seismic data points from the 3D seismic volumes for
   training. Then we represent these patches in the graph domain using the
   k-nearest neighbor graphs followed by the application of GCN. After
   training the patches in the networks, we classify the patches to
   identify the faults. We consider both synthetic and real data for
   training and testing. The seismic amplitude values, the seismic
   attribute values, and the successive difference values are used in the
   networks. We compare our implementation with the state-of-the-art
   method, the convolutional neural networks (CNN). The results show good
   accuracy when applied to both synthetic and real data. Additionally, the
   GCN method is more time efficient than that of CNN. We process the 3D
   seismic section by parallel processing the 2D patches.

AB Public concern detection provides potential guidance to the authorities
   for crisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting
   people's concerns and attention from online social media platforms has
   been widely acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public
   panic and prevent a social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time
   from massive volumes of information in social media turns out to be a
   big challenge, especially when sufficient manually labelled data is in
   the absence during public health emergencies, e.g., COVID-19. In this
   paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to identify
   people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph
   Convolutional Networks and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory
   integrated with Concern Graphs. Except for the sequential features from
   BERT embeddings, the regional features of tweets can be extracted by the
   Concern Graph module, which not only benefits the concern detection but
   also enables our model to be high noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can
   address the issue of insufficient manually labelled data. We conduct
   extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model by using both
   manually labelled tweets and automatically labelled tweets. The
   experimental results show that our model can outperform the
   state-of-the-art models on real-world datasets.

AB Aspect-category sentiment classification of microblog comments aims to
   identify the sentiment polarity of different opinion aspects in
   microblog comments, which is meaningful for the analysis of public
   opinion. At present, most of aspect-category sentiment classification
   methods need much annotation data, and regard comments as independent
   samples, without using of the relationship between comments. This
   article proposes an aspect-category sentiment classification method
   based on tensor graph convolutional networks. First, the combination of
   a comment and its aspect category is regarded as a hybrid node, and the
   original representation of a hybrid node is encoded by the Bert model.
   Second, sentiment graph and semantic graph are constructed according to
   the semantic similarity and sentimental relevance between hybrid nodes,
   and they are stacked into a tensor. Then two convolution operations,
   including intra-graph convolution and inter-graph convolution, are
   performed for each layer of graph tensor. In this way, hybrid nodes can
   learn and merge the heterogeneous information of different graphs.
   Finally, under the supervision of few labeled comments, the sentiment
   classification can be completed based on the features of the hybrid
   nodes. Experimental results on two microblog datasets show that the
   proposed model can significantly improve the performance of sentiment
   classification compared with other baseline models.

AB Human trajectory prediction is an essential task for various
   applications such as travel recommendation, location-sensitive
   advertisement, and traffic planning. Most existing approaches are
   sequential-model based and produce a prediction by mining behavior
   patterns. However, the effectiveness of pattern-based methods is not as
   good as expected in real-life conditions, such as data sparse or data
   missing. Moreover, due to the technical limitations of sensors or the
   traffic situation at the given time, people going to the same place may
   produce different trajectories. Even for people traveling along the same
   route, the observed transit records are not exactly the same. Therefore
   trajectories are always diverse, and extracting user intention from
   trajectories is difficult. In this paper, we propose an
   augmented-intention recurrent neural network (AI-RNN) model to predict
   locations in diverse trajectories. We first propose three strategies to
   generate graph structures to demonstrate travel context and then
   leverage graph convolutional networks to augment user travel intentions
   under graph view. Finally, we use gated recurrent units with augmented
   node vectors to predict human trajectories. We experiment with two
   representative real-life datasets and evaluate the performance of the
   proposed model by comparing its results with those of other
   state-of-the-art models. The results demonstrate that the AI-RNN model
   outperforms other methods in terms of top-k accuracy, especially in
   scenarios with low similarity.

AB The abundance of energy consumption data collected by smart meters has
   inspired researchers to employ deep neural networks to solve the
   existing problems in the power industry, such as Short-Term Load
   Forecasting (STLF). Most studies addressing the STLF problem, focus on
   historical load data and to achieve higher performance, they supplement
   costly accessible environmental and calendar variables with data. This
   approach ignores the existing spatial information among the consumers
   which subsequently might lead into the emergence of similar consumption
   patterns. In this paper, we present a Graph Convolutional Recurrent
   Neural Network, a novel neural architecture, for STLF problem that
   combines Graph Convolutional Networks and Long Short-Term Memory
   networks to simultaneously extract spatial and temporal information from
   users with similar consumption patterns. Our model captures spatial
   information from users without prior knowledge of their geographic
   location and does not rely on additional environmental variables. We
   compared our model to traditional baseline models for STLF using two
   real-world electricity consumption datasets. The empirical results
   demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction compared with the
   baseline models, exhibiting a 9.5% and an 8% improvement in terms of
   Mean Absolute Percentage Error, in the Customer Behavior Trials and Low
   Carbon London datasets, respectively.

AB Trajectory prediction is a crucial and challenging task in many domains
   (e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation). First, high-quality
   trajectory prediction methods need to capture the human-human
   interactions and human-scene interactions effectively to avoid
   collisions with moving agents and static obstacles. Moreover, it is
   indispensable for the approaches to be efficient and lightweight to
   reduce computing costs and economize public resources. To address these
   challenges, we propose a model with a Spatial-Temporal module and a
   heatmap module based on gated linear units. In the Spatial-Temporal
   module, an adaptive Graph Convolutional Network was proposed to capture
   the human-human interactions, which combines physical features with
   graph convolutional networks to speculate the agents' implicit
   relationships. As for the human-scene interaction, we encode the
   sequential local heatmap around each agent in the heatmap module. The
   model includes two gated linear units to capture the correlations of the
   agent's motion and dynamic changing trend of the surrounding scene,
   respectively. Compared with previous methods, our method is more
   lightweight and efficient with a smaller parameter size and shorter
   inference time. Meanwhile, our model achieves better experimental
   results on two publicly available datasets (ETH and UCY) and predicts
   more socially reasonable trajectories. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB As a fundamental spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, traffic
   prediction is pivotal in transportation management and urban computing.
   Nonetheless, the intricate and dynamic nature of spatiotemporal
   correlations presents significant obstacles in acquiring precise
   forecasts. Existing techniques utilize graph convolutional networks in
   conjunction with temporal modules, such as recurrent neural networks or
   transformer-based structures, to effectively extract spatiotemporal
   features. Unfortunately, current approaches struggle with outliers and
   fail to capture potential global correlations between different
   timestamps. In this study, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal
   Graph Convolution Network with Embedded location and time features
   (STEGCN) for traffic prediction problems, which can generate precise and
   prompt predictions. STEGCN effectively captures the complex
   interdependencies among location, time, and traffic volume by leveraging
   the TransD algorithm to embed their representations. For each timestamp,
   a graph convolution module is exploited to capture the spatial features,
   merged with the embeddings of location and time that serve as global
   external information. Then, we leverage a temporal module composed of
   1-D convolutions to capture the spatiotemporal patterns. The traffic
   volume embedding is employed to constrain predictions within a
   reasonable range. Extensive experiments and rigorous analysis show that
   our STEGCN model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating
   exceptional performance and potential for practical application.

AB Water distribution Networks (WDNs) are one of the most important
   infrastructures for modern society. Due to accidental or malicious
   reasons, water contamination incidents have been repeatedly reported all
   over the world, which not only disrupt the water supply but also
   endanger public health. To ensure the safety of WDNs, water quality
   sensors are deployed across the WDNs for real-time contamination
   detection and source identification. In the literature, various methods
   have been employed to improve the performance of contamination source
   identification (CSI) and recent studies show that there is a great
   potential to tackle the CSI problem by deep learning models. The success
   of deep learning based CSI methods often requires a large size of
   training samples being collected. In real-world situations, the number
   of contamination events occurring in a single WDN is rather small,
   especially for a newly built WDN. However, the existing CSI methods in
   the literature mostly focus on the study of training and applying models
   on the same WDNs and the knowledge of CSI gained from one WDN cannot be
   reused by a different WDN. To these ends, based on the application of
   graph convolutional networks, this paper provides a solution for
   cross-network CSI that can transfer the CSI knowledge learned from one
   WDN to a different WDN. Empirically, based on a benchmark WDN in the
   task of contamination source identification, we show that the proposed
   cross-network CSI method can achieve comparable accuracy even trained on
   a different WDN. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published

AB Graph learning (GL) can dynamically capture the distribution structure
   (graph structure) of data based on graph convolutional networks (GCN),
   and the learning quality of the graph structure directly influ-ences GCN
   for semi-supervised classification. Most existing methods combine the
   computational layer and the related losses into GCN for exploring the
   global graph (measuring graph structure from all data samples) or local
   graph (measuring graph structure from local data samples). The global
   graph empha-sizes the whole structure description of the inter-class
   data, while the local graph tends to the neigh-borhood structure
   representation of the intra-class data. However, it is difficult to
   simultaneously balance these learning process graphs for semi-supervised
   classification because of the interdependence of these graphs. To
   simulate the interdependence, deep graph learning (DGL) is proposed to
   find a better graph representation for semi-supervised classification.
   DGL can not only learn the global structure by the pre-vious layer
   metric computation updating, but also mine the local structure by next
   layer local weight reassignment. Furthermore, DGL can fuse the different
   structures by dynamically encoding the interde-pendence of these
   structures, and deeply mine the relationship of the different structures
   by hierarchical progressive learning to improve the performance of
   semi-supervised classification. Experiments demon-strate that the DGL
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets
   (Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed) for citation networks and two benchmark
   datasets (MNIST and Cifar10) for images.

AB Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models have attracted attention given
   their high accuracy in interpreting graph data. One of the primary
   building blocks of a GCN model is aggregation, which gathers and
   averages the feature vectors corresponding to the vertices adjacent to
   each individual vertex. Aggregation works by multiplying the adjacency
   and feature matrices. The size of both matrices exceeds the on-chip
   cache capacity, and the adjacency matrix is highly sparse. These lead to
   little data reuse and cause numerous main-memory accesses during the
   aggregation process. Thus, aggregation exhibits memory-intensive
   characteristics. We propose GraNDe, an NDP architecture that accelerates
   memory-intensive aggregation operations by locating processing elements
   near the DRAM datapath to exploit rank-level parallelism. By exploring
   the data mapping of the operand matrices to DRAM ranks, we discover that
   the optimal mapping differs depending on the configuration of a specific
   GCN layer. With our optimal layer-by-layer mapping scheme, GraNDe shows
   a speedup up to 4.3x compared to the baseline system on open-graph
   benchmark datasets.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of low-speed convergence in
   Reinforcement Learning (RL). As a solution, various potential-based
   reward shaping techniques were pro-posed to form the potential function.
   Learning a potential function is still challenging and comparable to
   building a value function from scratch. In this work, our main
   contribution is proposing a new scheme for reward shaping, which
   combines (1) the Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRN), (2)
   augmented Krylov, and (3) look-ahead advice to form the potential
   function. We propose an architecture for GCRN that combines Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCN) to capture spatial dependencies and
   Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRUs) to account for temporal
   dependencies. Our definition of the loss function of GCRN incorporates
   the message passing technique of the Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Since
   the transition matrix of the environment is hard to compute, we use the
   Krylov basis to estimate the transition matrix, which outperforms the
   existing approximation bases. Unlike existing potential functions that
   only rely on states to perform reward shaping, we use both the states
   and actions through the look-ahead advice mech-anism to produce more
   precise advice. Our evaluations conducted on the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo
   games show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art that
   utilizes GCN as the potential function in most games in terms of the
   learning speed while reaching higher rewards.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Organizing the implicit topology of a document as a graph, and further
   performing feature extraction via the graph convolutional network (GCN),
   has proven effective in document analysis. However, existing document
   graphs are often restricted to expressing single-level relations, which
   are predefined and independent of downstream learning. A set of
   learnable hierarchical graphs are built to explore multilevel sentence
   relations, assisted by a hierarchical probabilistic topic model. Based
   on these graphs, multiple parallel GCNs are used to extract multilevel
   semantic features, which are aggregated by an attention mechanism for
   different document-comprehension tasks. Equipped with variational
   inference, the graph construction and GCN are learned jointly, allowing
   the graphs to evolve dynamically to better match the downstream task.
   The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed multilevel sentence
   relation graph convolutional network (MuserGCN) is demonstrated via
   experiments on document classification, abstractive summarization, and
   matching.

AB Prediction of the molecular compound structure-activity relationship is
   one of the most critical tasks in computer-assisted drug design. To
   accurately predict the properties of molecular compounds and explain
   their structure-activity relationships, we proposed a subgraph embedding
   model, subGE, based on reinforcement learning and mutual information
   mechanisms. First, molecular compounds were abstracted into graphs, and
   the original graphs were sampled using a breadth-first search. These
   subgraphs were then encoded using graph neural networks and converted
   into graph embeddings. Reinforcement learning was introduced to reduce
   the dimensionality of the subgraph embeddings and filter out significant
   subgraphs. A mutual information mechanism was introduced to further
   enhance the ability of the filtered subgraphs to characterize a full
   graph. SubGE was evaluated based on three open-source datasets, BBBP,
   Bace, and Clintox from the DeepChem package developed by MoleculeNet.
   The experimental results showed that subGE achieved accuracies of
   86.61%, 80.49%, 95.81%, and 96.34% for four classification tasks with
   three datasets. These values represent improvements of 16.87%, 19.29%,
   3.91%, and 3.73%, respectively, compared to that of existing graph
   convolutional networks, and of 8.34%, 6.64%, 5.53%, and 5.50%,
   respectively, compared to that of the direct encoding of subgraphs
   without introducing reinforcement learning and mutual information
   mechanisms. The subgraphs extracted by subGE could fully explain the
   conformational relationships of compounds through visualization.

AB Knowledge graph (KG) embedding encodes the entities and relations from a
   KG into low-dimensional vector spaces to support various applications
   such as KG completion, question answering, and recommender systems. In
   real world, knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with
   addition or deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on
   embedding static KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes
   in a KG, these models need to be retrained on the whole KG with a high
   time cost. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned problem, we
   propose a new context-aware Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE)
   method which supports the embedding learning in an online fashion. DKGE
   introduces two different representations (i.e., knowledge embedding and
   contextual element embedding) for each entity and each relation, in the
   joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their contexts, by
   employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate strategy,
   and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts of
   a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE
   can rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online
   learning algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from
   scratch. Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question
   answering in a dynamic environment demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of DKGE. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper develops a novel reduced-order model called SGCNN, which
   combines the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with the Recurrent
   Neural Networks (RNN), to predict sequential transient flow around
   cylinders using unstructured flow field data. In flow field prediction,
   we use GCN's unique message passing mechanism to extract and aggregate
   the characteristics of the flow field grid in non-Euclidean space,
   eliminating the pixelization process of CNN in non-Euclidean space, and
   significantly improving the prediction accuracy. GRU is used as the unit
   of the RNN network to obtain the changeable physical characteristics
   through the hidden layer, thereby achieving continuous prediction of the
   flow field. According to our literature review, this is the first
   investigation to estimate sequential transient flow fields around
   cylinders. The proposed model is initially verified with the flow around
   single cylinder. Taking the numerical simulation as the reference, the
   relative errors of the predicted sequential velocity and the pressure
   fields are less than 3% and 2%, respectively. Subsequently, the
   complexity of the investigation is increased by varying the Reynolds
   number and introducing additional cylinders in the flow region. The
   predicted physical fields consistently align well with CFD simulations,
   and the computational time is remarkably reduced by more than 90%.

AB Motivated by the powerful capability of deep neural networks in feature
   learning, a new graph-based neural network is proposed to learn local
   and global relational information on skeleton sequences represented as
   spatio-temporal graphs (STGs). The pipeline of our network architecture
   consists of three main stages. As the first stage, spatial-temporal
   sub-graphs (sub-STGs) are projected into a latent space in which every
   point is represented as a linear subspace. The second stage is based on
   message passing to acquire the localized correlated features of the
   nodes in the latent space. The third stage relies on graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs) to reason the long-range spatio-temporal dependencies
   through a graph representation of the latent space. Finally, the average
   pooling layer and the softmax classifier are then employed to predict
   the action categories based on the extracted local and global
   correlations. We validate our model in terms of action recognition using
   three challenging datasets: the NTU RGB+D, Kinetics Motion, and SBU
   Kinect Interaction datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our approach and show that our proposed model
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Scaling adaptive traffic signal control involves dealing with
   combinatorial state and action spaces. Multi-agent reinforcement
   learning attempts to address this challenge by distributing control to
   specialized agents. However, specialization hinders generalization and
   transferability, and the computational graphs underlying neural-network
   architectures-dominating in the multi-agent setting-do not offer the
   flexibility to handle an arbitrary number of entities which changes both
   between road networks, and over time as vehicles traverse the network.
   We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning (IG-RL) based on
   graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the structure of any road
   network, to learn detailed representations of traffic signal controllers
   and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables learning of a
   transferable-adaptive-trafficsignal-control policy. After being trained
   on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new
   road networks and traffic distributions, with no additional training and
   a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability compared
   to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the granularity
   of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the lane
   level and the vehicle level. The proposed method is tested on both road
   networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We
   compare IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific
   baselines. In both synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment
   involving the control of the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show
   that different instantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.

AB In skeleton-based action recognition, graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs) have achieved remarkable success. However, there are two
   shortcomings of current GCN-based methods. Firstly, the computation cost
   is pretty heavy, typically over 15 GFLOPs for one action sample. Some
   recent works even reach similar to 100 GFLOPs. Secondly, the receptive
   fields of both spatial graph and temporal graph are inflexible. Although
   recent works introduce incremental adaptive modules to enhance the
   expressiveness of spatial graph, their efficiency is still limited by
   regular GCN structures. In this paper, we propose a shift graph
   convolutional network (ShiftGCN) to overcome both short-comings.
   ShiftGCN is composed of novel shift graph operations and lightweight
   point-wise convolutions, where the shift graph operations provide
   flexible receptive fields for both spatial graph and temporal graph. To
   further boost the efficiency, we introduce four techniques and build a
   more lightweight skeleton-based action recognition model named
   ShiftGCN++. ShiftGCN-H- is an extremely computation-efficient model,
   which is designed for low-power and low-cost devices with very limited
   computing power. On three datasets for skeleton-based action
   recognition, ShiftGCN notably exceeds the state-of-the-art methods with
   over 10x less FLOPs and 4x practical speedup. ShiftGCN-H- further boosts
   the efficiency of ShiftGCN, which achieves comparable performance with
   6x less FLOPs and 2x practical speedup.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful tools for analyzing
   structured data with entities based on messages passing between a node
   and its surrounding nodes; these networks exhibit exceptional
   capabilities in diverse complex graph learning tasks. However, despite
   GCNs being capable of incorporating information from entities, they
   often neglect the structural connections between the entities generated
   by latent factors. In this study, we propose a global disentangled graph
   convolutional neural network based on a graph topological metric to
   identify these latent factors and perform graph-level disentanglement
   learning. In the proposed framework, a simple graph is accepted as the
   input and disentangled into several factorized graphs. Each factorized
   graph represents a latent factor and the disentangled relationship among
   the nodes. Specifically, our approach decouples the message passing
   process in GCNs into two distinct flows, feature and structural
   information flow. Importantly, a topological metric, named mean average
   distance, is introduced to promote the disentanglement among the factor
   graphs. Furthermore, we utilize the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator to
   promote disentanglement through feature information flow. Experiments on
   synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated the superiority of our
   framework over state-of-the-art GNN networks. This work introduces a
   novel approach, preserving independence among latent factors while
   ensuring each factor maintains a consistent and interpretable meaning.
   We anticipate that this research can provide theoretical and technical
   analysis to further advance the understanding of graph disentanglement
   learning.

AB Multi-person pose tracking task aims to estimate and track person
   keypoints in videos. Most of the previous methods follow the general
   track-by-detection strategy that ignores the consistent pose information
   during the whole framework. Thus, they often suffer from missing
   detections or inaccurate human association in challenging scenes with
   motion blur or person occlusion. To handle those problems, we propose a
   pose-guided tracking-by-detection framework that fuses pose information
   into both video human detection and human association procedures. In the
   video human detection stage, we adopt the pose-guided person location
   prediction exploiting the temporal information to make up missing
   detections. Technically, pose heatmaps are utilized to cope with the
   person-specific intra-class distractors. Furthermore, in the human
   association stage, we propose an appearance discriminative model based
   on the hierarchical pose-guided graph convolutional networks (PoseGCN).
   The PoseGCN-based model exploits human structural relations to boost
   person representation. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our
   method on the challenging pose tracking benchmark. Our proposed method
   ranks first on the PoseTrack leaderboard. (1) (1)

AB Information networks generally exhibit three characteristics, namely
   dynamicity, heterogeneity, and node attribute diversity. However, most
   existing network embedding approaches only consider two of the three
   when embedding each node into low -dimensional space. Adding to such an
   existing approach a technique of processing the remaining characteristic
   can easily cause incompatibility. One solution to process the three
   characteristics together is to treat the dynamic heterogeneous
   attributed network (DHAN) as a temporal sequence of heterogeneous
   attributed network (HAN) snapshots. For example, existing graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs)-based DHAN embedding approaches embed the
   HAN snapshots to get static representations offline, and then
   dynamically capture temporal dependencies between adjacent snapshots
   online to maintain fresh representations of the DHAN. However, those
   approaches encounter the convergence problem when stacking multiple
   convolutional layers to capture more topological information. Some other
   existing approaches dynamically update the representations of HAN
   snapshots online, neglecting the efficiency requirement of online
   scenarios and the temporal dependencies between snapshots. To address
   the two issues, we propose a new framework called Dynamic Heterogeneous
   Attributed Network Embedding (DHANE), consisting of a static model MGAT
   and a dynamic model NICE. MGAT captures more topological information
   while maintaining GCN convergence by performing metagraph-based
   attention in each convolutional layer. NICE preserves network freshness
   while reducing the computational load of the update by only examining
   network changes and updating their embedding representations. Extensive
   experiments show that DHANE achieves up to 27x speedup and 9.1-26.4%
   higher accuracy on several real dynamic heterogeneous attributed
   networks for online classification.

AB Knowledge tracing is a modeling method of students' knowledge mastery.
   The deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model uses long short-term memory
   (LSTM) to process the sequence data of students exercises. However, the
   LSTM-based model pays more attention to the short-term response status
   of students while ignoring the long-term learning process. Moreover,
   existing graph-based knowledge tracing models focus on the static
   relationship between exercises and skills, ignoring the dynamic graphs
   formed by students exercises in a session. In this work, we propose a
   novel knowledge tracing model which is based on an exercise session
   graph, named session graph based knowledge tracing (SGKT). The session
   graph is used to model the students' answering process. In addition, a
   relationship graph is used to model the relationship between exercises
   and skills. Then we use gated graph neural networks to obtain the
   students' knowledge state from the session graph and use graph
   convolutional networks to obtain the embedding representations of
   exercises and skills in the relationship graph. Next, through the
   interaction mechanism, multiple interaction states composed of knowledge
   states and embedding representations are obtained. The attention
   mechanism is used to find the focus from these states and make
   predictions. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available
   datasets and the results show that our approach has advantages over some
   existing baseline methods.

AB Semi-supervised short text classification is a challenging problem due
   to the sparsity and limited labeled data. Due to the lack of labeled
   data, many models focus on the generation of text samples, which is
   cumbersome and has poor scalability. To overcome this defi-ciency, in
   this paper, we propose a Self-Training Text method based on Graph
   Convolutional Networks (ST-Text-GCN). Differently from the previous
   literature, our self -training method is convenient. The labeled
   information is propagated to target samples along the structure of the
   manifold, instead of introducing the extra knowledge. Specifically,
   instead of adding text training samples, our method adds keywords to
   training set. The model will calculate the confidence of each word.
   Confidence indicates the degree of ambiguity of a word. Some words with
   high confidence are automatically marked as pseudo-labeled data.
   Meanwhile, word confidence is added to the calculation of the edge
   weights of the graph to reduce the classification error caused by word
   ambiguity. Our method makes full use of the keywords in short texts when
   labeled data is scarce. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated
   that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple
   benchmark datasets.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, advances in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have
   given new insights into the development of social recommendation.
   However, many existing GCN-based social recommendation methods often
   directly apply GCN to capture user-item and user-user interactions,
   which probably have two main limitations: (a) Due to the power-law
   property of the degree distribution, the vanilla GCN with static
   normalized adjacencymatrix has limitations in learning node
   representations, especially for the long-tail nodes; (b) multityped
   social relationships between users that are ubiquitous in the real world
   are rarely considered. In this article, we propose a novel Bilateral
   Filtering Heterogeneous Attention Network (BFHAN), which improves
   long-tail node representations and leverages multi-typed social
   relationships between user nodes. First, we propose a novel graph
   convolutional filter for the user-item bipartite network and extend it
   to the user-user homogeneous network. Further, we theoretically analyze
   the correlation between the convergence values of different graph
   convolutional filters and node degrees after stacking multiple layers.
   Second, we model multi-relational social interactions between users as
   the multiplex network and further propose a multiplex attention network
   to capture distinctive inter-layer influences for user representations.
   Last but not least, the experimental results demonstrate that our
   proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art GCN-based methods
   for social recommendation tasks.

AB Predicting a comprehensive set of relevant labels on chest X-ray images
   faces great challenges towards bridging visual and textual modalities.
   Despite the success of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) on modeling
   label dependencies using co-occurrence matrix generated from dataset,
   they still suffer from inherent label imbalance in dataset and ignore
   the explicit relations among labels presented in external medical
   knowledge graph (KG). We argue that jointly exploiting both the label
   co-occurrence matrix in dataset and the label relations in external
   knowledge graph facilitates multi-label lesion annotation. To model
   relevant lesion labels more comprehensively, we propose a KG-augmented
   model via Aggregating Explicit Relations for multi-label lesion
   annotation, called AER-GCN. The KG-augmented model employs GCN to learn
   the explicit label relations in external medical KG, and aggregates the
   explicit relations into statistical graph built from label co-occurrence
   information. Specially, we present three approaches on modeling the
   explicit label correlations in external knowledge, and two approaches on
   incorporating the explicit relations into co-occurrence relations for
   lesion annotation. We exploit SNOMED CT as the source of external
   knowledge and evaluate the performance of AER-GCN on the ChestX-ray and
   IU X-ray datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
   outperforms other state-of-the-art models.

AB Spatiotemporal prediction is one attractive research topic in urban
   computing, which is of great significance to urban planning and
   management. At present, there are many attempts to predict the
   spatiotemporal state of systems using various deep learning models.
   However, most existing models tend to improve prediction accuracy with
   larger parameter scale and time consumption, but ignoring ease of use in
   practice. To overcome this question, we propose a lightweight
   spatiotemporal graph dilated convolutional network called STGDN with
   satisfactory prediction accuracy and lower model complexity. More
   specifically, we propose a novel dilated convolution operator and
   integrate it into traditional causal convolutional networks and graph
   convolutional networks to greatly improve the efficiency of prediction.
   The proposed dilated convolution operator can significantly reduce the
   depth of the model, thereby reducing the parameter scale and improving
   the computational efficiency of the model. We conducted on multi
   experiments on three real-world spatiotemporal datasets (traffic
   dataset, PM2.5 dataset, and temperature dataset) to prove the
   effectiveness and advantage of our proposed STGDN. The experimental
   results show that the proposed STGDN model outperforms or achieves
   comparable prediction accuracy of the existing nine baselines with
   higher operational efficiency and fewer model parameters. Codes are

AB Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are the top cause for
   disabilities in later life and various types of experiments have been
   performed to understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease with
   the aim of coming up with potential drug targets. These experiments have
   been carried out by scientists working in different domains such as
   proteomics, molecular biology, clinical diagnostics and genomics. The
   results of such experiments are stored in the databases designed for
   collecting data of similar types. However, in order to get a systematic
   view of the disease from these independent but complementary data sets,
   it is necessary to combine them. In this study we describe a
   heterogeneous network-based data set for Alzheimer's disease (HENA).
   Additionally, we demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art graph
   convolutional networks, i.e. deep learning methods for the analysis of
   such large heterogeneous biological data sets. We expect HENA to allow
   scientists to explore and analyze their own results in the broader
   context of Alzheimer's disease research.

AB The white-matter (micro-)structural architecture of the brain promotes
   synchrony among neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned
   functional connections. A fundamental problem for systems neuroscience
   is determining the best way to relate structural and functional networks
   quantified by diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI.
   As one of the state-of-the-art approaches for network analysis, graph
   convolutional networks (GCN) have been separately used to analyze
   functional and structural networks, but have not been applied to explore
   inter-network relationships. In this work, we propose to couple the two
   networks of an individual by adding inter-network edges between
   corresponding brain regions, so that the joint structure-function graph
   can be directly analyzed by a single GCN. The weights of inter-network
   edges are learnable, reflecting non-uniform structure-function coupling
   strength across the brain. We apply our Joint-GCN to predict age and sex
   of 662 participants from the public dataset of the National Consortium
   on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) based on their
   functional and micro-structural white-matter networks. Our results
   support that the proposed Joint-GCN outperforms existing multi-modal
   graph learning approaches for analyzing structural and functional
   networks.

AB Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted extensive
   attention due to the robustness of the human skeleton data in the field
   of computer vision. In recent years, there is a trend of using graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the human skeleton into a
   spatio-temporal graph to explore the internal connections of human
   joints that has achieved remarkable performance. However, the existing
   methods always ignore the remote dependency between joints, and fixed
   temporal convolution kernels will lead to inflexible temporal modeling.
   In this paper, we propose a multi-scale adaptive aggregate graph
   convolution network (MSAAGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition.
   First, we designed a multi-scale spatial GCN to aggregate the remote and
   multi-order semantic information of the skeleton data and
   comprehensively model the internal relations of the human body for
   feature learning. Then, the multi-scale temporal module adaptively
   selects convolution kernels of different temporal lengths to obtain a
   more flexible temporal map. Additionally, the attention mechanism is
   added to obtain more meaningful joint, frame and channel information in
   the skeleton sequence. Extensive experiments on three large-scale
   datasets (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and Kinetics-Skeleton) demonstrate
   the superiority of our proposed MSAAGCN.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis(ABSA) aims to identify the sentiment
   polarity of specific aspects in sentences, which can more accurately
   mine the sentiment polarity of users towards different aspects. Most of
   the existing works derive the sentiment features of specific aspects by
   interactively learning the dependencies between different aspects of the
   context. However, the above work has neglected to use the external
   affective commonsense knowledge to augment the ability of the Graph
   Convolutional Networks(GCNs) to interactively capture sentiment
   dependencies of the inter-aspect words in different contexts. In
   addition, compared to the ABSA research in English, the existing
   research pays less attention to the Chinese-oriented research.
   Meanwhile, multi-head self-sttention(MHSA) is applied to extract richer
   context syntax and semantic interaction features. In this paper, we
   propose a novel knowledge-aware model in which affective knowledge
   augments interactive GCN for Chinese-oriented ABSA, namely AKM-IGCN.
   Moreover, this model can be applied to effectively analyze both Chinese
   and English comments simultaneously. Hence, we conducted experiments on
   four Chinese datasets(Camera, Phone, Notebook and Car) and six English
   benchmark datasets(Restaurant14, Restaurant15, Restaurant16, Twitter,
   MAMS, Tshirt). Experimental results illustrate that our proposed model
   outperforms or approaches state-of-the-art models.

AB With the widespread application of blockchain technology, the cyberspace
   security issue of phishing has also appeared in the emerging blockchain
   cryptocurrency ecosystem. Because phishing fraud in cryptocurrency
   transactions has its own unique characteristics compared to traditional
   phishing, many existing phishing detection algorithms are not usable.
   Therefore, based on graph convolutional networks, we have researched and
   built a high-performance model for detecting blockchain cryptocurrency
   phishing fraud. Our model divides the constructed blockchain
   cryptocurrency transaction graph into "Sender" and "Receiver" graphs,
   according to the sending and receiving directions. Then, the edge
   features in the graph are transferred. Finally, we use a double-layer
   graph convolution network for feature learning and send it to the
   classifier for fraud detection. After completing training on the actual
   dataset collected from Ethereum, the model achieved an accuracy of
   88.02% and an F1 score of 88.14% on the test data, which had a better
   performance than that of the other models. Our model provides a new
   concept for the detection of phishing scams in blockchain cryptocurrency
   networks.

AB At present, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become popular in
   visual classification tasks because of their superior performance.
   However, CNN-based methods do not consider the correlation of visual
   data to be classified. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs)
   have mitigated this problem by modeling the pairwise relationship in
   visual data. Real-world tasks of visual classification typically must
   address numerous complex relationships in the data, which are not fit
   for the modeling of the graph structure using GCNs. Therefore, it is
   vital to explore the underlying correlation of visual data. Regarding
   this issue, we propose a framework called the hypergraph-induced
   convolutional network to explore the high-order correlation in visual
   data during deep neural networks. First, a hypergraph structure is
   constructed to formulate the relationship in visual data. Then, the
   high-order correlation is optimized by a learning process based on the
   constructed hypergraph. The classification tasks are performed by
   considering the high-order correlation in the data. Thus, the
   convolution of the hypergraph-induced convolutional network is based on
   the corresponding high-order relationship, and the optimization on the
   network uses each data and considers the high-order correlation of the
   data. To evaluate the proposed hypergraph-induced convolutional network
   framework, we have conducted experiments on three visual data sets: the
   National Taiwan University 3-D model data set, Princeton Shape
   Benchmark, and multiview RGB-depth object data set. The experimental
   results and comparison in all data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
   our proposed hypergraph-induced convolutional network compared with the
   state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been developed to
   explore the spatial relationship between pixels, achieving better
   classification performance of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However,
   these methods fail to sufficiently leverage the relationship between
   spectral bands in HSI data. As such, we propose an adaptive
   cross-attention-driven spatial-spectral graph convolutional network
   (ACSS-GCN), which is composed of a spatial GCN (Sa-GCN) subnetwork, a
   spectral GCN (Se-GCN) subnetwork, and a graph cross-attention fusion
   module (GCAFM). Specifically, Sa-GCN and Se-GCN are proposed to extract
   the spatial and spectral features by modeling the correlations between
   spatial pixels and between spectral bands, respectively. Then, by
   integrating attention mechanism into information aggregation of the
   graph, the GCAFM, including three parts, i.e., the spatial graph
   attention block, the spectral graph attention block, and the fusion
   block, is designed to fuse the spatial and spectral features, and
   suppress noise interference in Sa-GCN and Se-GCN. Moreover, the idea of
   the adaptive graph is introduced to explore an optimal graph through
   backpropagation during the training process. Experiments on two HSI
   datasets show that the proposed method achieves better performance than
   other classification methods.

AB Spatial power load forecasting is crucial for power grid planning,
   generation planning, dispatching, efficient power utilization, and
   sustainable development. The integration of new energy sources and
   electric vehicles has significantly altered grid loads, increasing the
   complexity of spatial load forecasting. However, existing techniques
   fail to fully consider the temporal and spatial correlation
   characteristics of data, leading to challenges in data identification
   and summarization. This reduces load forecasting accuracy and prolongs
   prediction time. To address these issues, a spatial electric load
   forecasting method based on improved scale limited dynamic time warping
   (LDTW) and graph convolutional network (GCN) are proposed. Firstly, the
   improved scale LDTW is used to improve the clustering effect of
   K-Mediods++, refine the type of load data, and make the subsequent model
   training more targeted. Secondly, the interconnections and distances of
   substations in a real network structure is used to build a graph model
   to capture the power load distribution. Finally, based on the clustering
   results and the graph model, GCN-LSTM is used to construct the
   spatio-temporal forecasting algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested
   using load data from a region in Shanghai and compared with other
   advanced algorithms. Results show that the algorithm achieves higher
   prediction accuracy and efficiency.

AB As the use of digital currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, increases in
   popularity, phishing scams and other cybercriminal activities on
   blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum) have also risen. Current methods
   of detecting phishing in Ethereum focus mainly on the transaction
   features and local network structure. However, these methods fail to
   account for the complexity of interactions between edges and the
   handling of large graphs. Additionally, these methods face significant
   issues due to the limited number of positive labels available. Given
   this, we propose a scheme that we refer to as the Bagging Multiedge
   Graph Convolutional Network to detect phishing scams on Ethereum. First,
   we extract the features from transactions and transform the complex
   Ethereum transaction network into three simple inter-node graphs. Then,
   we use graph convolution to generate node embeddings that leverage the
   global structural information of the inter-node graphs. Further, we
   apply the bagging strategy to overcome the issues of data imbalance and
   the Positive Unlabeled (PU) problem in transaction data. Finally, to
   evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we conduct experiments using
   actual transaction data. The results demonstrate that our Bagging
   Multiedge Graph Convolutional Network (0.877 AUC) outperforms all of the
   baseline classification methods in detecting phishing scams on Ethereum.

AB The online social media ecosystem is becoming more and more confused
   because of more and more fake information and the social media of
   malicious users' fake content; at the same time, unspeakable pain has
   been brought to mankind. Social robot detection uses supervised
   classification based on artificial feature extraction. However, user
   privacy is also involved in using these methods, and the hidden feature
   information is also ignored, such as semi-supervised algorithms with low
   utilization rates and graph features. In this work, we symmetrically
   combine BERT and GCN (Graph Convolutional Network, GCN) and propose a
   novel model that combines large scale pretraining and transductive
   learning for social robot detection, BGSRD. BGSRD constructs a
   heterogeneous graph over the dataset and represents Twitter as nodes
   using BERT representations. Corpus learning via text graph convolution
   network is a single text graph, which is mainly built for corpus-based
   on word co-occurrence and document word relationship. BERT and GCN
   modules can be jointly trained in BGSRD to achieve the best of merit,
   training data and unlabeled test data can spread label influence through
   graph convolution and can be carried out in the large-scale pre-training
   of massive raw data and the transduction learning of joint learning
   representation. The experiment shows that a better performance can also
   be achieved by BGSRD on a wide range of social robot detection datasets.

AB In silico driven optimization of compound properties related to
   pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety is a key requirement in
   modern drug discovery. Nowadays, large and harmonized datasets allow to
   implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a framework for leveraging
   predictive models. Nevertheless, various available model architectures
   differ in their global applicability and performance in lead
   optimization projects, such as stability over time and interpretability
   of the results. Here, we describe and compare the value of established
   DNN-based methods for the prediction of key ADME property trends and
   biological activity in an industrial drug discovery environment,
   represented by microsomal lability, CYP3A4 inhibition and factor Xa
   inhibition. Three architectures are exemplified, our earlier described
   multilayer perceptron approach (MLP), graph convolutional network-based
   models (GCN) and a vector representation approach, Mol2Vec. From a
   statistical perspective, MLP and GCN were found to perform superior over
   Mol2Vec, when applied to external validation sets. Interestingly,
   GCN-based predictions are most stable over a longer period in a time
   series validation study. Apart from those statistical observations, DNN
   prove of value to guide local SAR. To illustrate this important aspect
   in pharmaceutical research projects, we discuss challenging applications
   in medicinal chemistry towards a more realistic picture of artificial
   intelligence in drug discovery.

AB Recently, many models based on the combination of graph convolutional
   networks and deep learning have attracted extensive attention for their
   superior performance in graph clustering tasks. However, the existing
   models have the following limitations: (1) Existing models are limited
   by the calculation method of graph convolution, and their computational
   cost will increase exponentially as the graph scale grows. (2) Stacking
   too many convolutional layers causes the over-smoothing issue and
   neglects the local graph structure. (3) Expanding the range of the
   neighborhood and the model depth together is difficult due to the
   orthogonal relationship between them. Inspired by personalized pagerank
   and auto-encoder, we conduct the node-wise graph clustering task in the
   undirected simple graph as the research direction and propose a Scalable
   Deep Network (SDN) for graph clustering via personalized pagerank.
   Specifically, we utilize the combination of multi-layer perceptrons and
   linear propagation layer based on personalized pagerank as the backbone
   network (i.e., the Quasi-GNN module) and employ a DNN module for
   auto-encoder to learn different dimensions embeddings. After that, SDN
   combines the two embeddings correspondingly; then, it utilizes a dual
   self-supervised module to constrain the training of the embedding and
   clustering process. Our proposed Quasi-GNN module reduces the
   computational costs of traditional GNN models in a decoupled approach
   and solves the orthogonal relationship between the model depth and the
   neighborhood range. Meanwhile, it also alleviates the degraded
   clustering effect caused by the over-smoothing issue. We conducted
   experiments on five widely used graph datasets. The experimental results
   demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB Modern recommender systems (RS) work by processing a number of signals
   that can be inferred from large sets of user-item interaction data. The
   main signal to analyze stems from the raw matrix that represents
   interactions. However, we can increase the performance of RS by
   considering other kinds of signals like the context of interactions,
   which could be, for example, the time or date of the interaction, the
   user location, or sequential data corresponding to the historical
   interactions of the user with the system. These complex, context-based
   interaction signals are characterized by a rich relational structure
   that can be represented by a multi-partite graph. Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCNs) have been used successfully in collaborative filtering
   with simple user-item interaction data. In this work, we generalize the
   use of GCNs for N-partite graphs by considering N multiple context
   dimensions and propose a simple way for their seamless integration in
   modern deep learning RS architectures. More specifically, we define a
   graph convolutional embedding layer for N-partite graphs that processes
   user-item-context interactions and constructs node embeddings by
   leveraging their relational structure. Experiments on several datasets
   show the benefits of the introduced GCN embedding layer by measuring the
   performance of different context-enriched tasks.

AB Sigma profiles are quantum-chemistry-derived molecular descriptors that
   encode the polarity of molecules. They have shown great performance when
   used as a feature in machine learning applications. To accelerate the
   development of these models and the construction of large sigma profile
   databases, this work proposes a graph convolutional network (GCN)
   architecture to predict sigma profiles from molecule structures. To do
   so, the usage of molecular mechanics (force field atom types) is
   explored as a computationally inexpensive node-level featurization
   technique to encode the local and global chemical environments of atoms
   in molecules. The GCN models developed in this work accurately predict
   the sigma profiles of assorted organic and inorganic compounds. The best
   GCN model here reported, obtained using Merck molecular force field
   (MMFF) atom types, displayed training and testing set coefficients of
   determination of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, which are superior to
   previous methodologies reported in the literature. This performance
   boost is shown to be due to both the usage of a convolutional
   architecture and node-level features based on force field atom types.
   Finally, to demonstrate their practical applicability, we used
   GCN-predicted sigma profiles as the input to machine learning models
   previously developed in the literature that predict boiling temperatures
   and aqueous solubilities. Using the predicted sigma profiles as input,
   these models were able to compute both physicochemical properties using
   significantly less computational resources and displayed only a slight
   decrease in performance when compared with sigma profiles obtained from
   quantum chemistry methods.

AB Modeling the interactions between users and items to accurately predict
   a user preference on items is very crucial for improving the performance
   of recommendation. Although existing graph-based methods have achieved
   great progress in predicting a user preference for recommendation, they
   usually need additional side information which is difficultly obtained,
   and ignore the temporal-order associations between items (users) when
   constructing graphs. In this paper, we propose a temporal-order
   association-based dynamic graph evolution model for recommendation,
   which can not only capture temporal-order item associations and user
   relationships by recurrently constructing a temporal-order item
   association graph and a user similarity graph but also update and
   promote the embeddings and graphs by performing a novel dynamic
   evolution mechanism based on two graph convolutional networks (GCNs).
   Specifically, the proposed model consists of two main components:
   recurrent graph construction component and message propagation and
   aggregation component. The former recurrently constructs the
   temporal-order item association graph and the user similarity graph only
   from the history interactions and embeddings to capture the item-item
   and user-user relationships. The latter performs a novel dynamic
   evolution mechanism based on two GCNs on these two auxiliary graphs and
   interaction graph to refine user and item representations, which further
   helps the process of constructing two auxiliary graphs. Finally, the
   final embeddings of users and items are used to predict a user
   preference on all items the user has not interacted with. The
   experimental results illustrate that our method outperforms the
   state-of-the-art methods on five real-world datasets.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have attracted increasing research
   attention, which merits in its strong ability to handle graph data, such
   as the citation network or social network. Existing models typically use
   first-order neighborhood information to design specific convolution
   operations, which aggregate the features of all adjacent nodes. However,
   such models ignore the high-order spatial relationship among neighboring
   nodes in noisy data due to its modeling complexity. In this article, we
   propose a novel robust graph relational network to address this issue
   toward modeling high-order relationships in noisy data for graph
   convolution. Our key innovation lies in designing a generic relation
   network layer, which is used to infer the underlying relations among
   adjacent noisy nodes. Specifically, a fixed number of adjacent nodes for
   each node is chosen by solving the ridge regression problem, in which
   the regression coefficients are used to rank the adjacent nodes of each
   node in a graph. Furthermore, to mine the rich features, we extract
   high-order information from the nodes to significantly enhance the
   representation ability of the GCNs for extensive applications. We
   conduct extensive semisupervised node classification experiments on the
   noisy benchmark datasets, which clearly show that our model is superior
   to the existing methods and can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

AB Network traffic forecasting is essential for efficient network
   management and planning. Accurate long-term forecasting models are also
   essential for proactive control of upcoming congestion events. Due to
   the complex spatial-temporal dependencies between traffic flows,
   traditional time series forecasting models are often unable to fully
   extract the spatial-temporal characteristics between the traffic flows.
   To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-channel based graph
   convolutional network (DC-STGCN) model. The proposed model consists of
   two temporal components that characterize the daily and weekly
   correlation of the network traffic. Each of these two components
   contains a spatial-temporal characteristics extraction module consisting
   of a dual-channel graph convolutional network (DCGCN) and a gated
   recurrent unit (GRU). The DCGCN further consists of an adjacency feature
   extraction module (AGCN) and a correlation feature extraction module
   (PGCN) to capture the connectivity between nodes and the proximity
   correlation, respectively. The GRU further extracts the temporal
   characteristics of the traffic. The experimental results based on real
   network data sets show that the prediction accuracy of the DC-STGCN
   model overperforms the existing baseline and is capable of making
   long-term predictions.

AB Detecting deceptive reviews can assist customers in grasping the real
   evaluation of products and services to make better purchase decisions
   and help companies satisfy timely to their customers' expectations.
   Methods based on neural networks for deceptive review detection have
   made significant progress in recent years. Models using attention
   mechanisms such as BERT have demonstrated the ability to capture
   contextual information in review texts. However, their ability to
   capture global information about the word level is limited. This latter
   is the strength of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). In this study,
   we propose a detection model (SGCN-BERT) based on the combination of
   Semantic Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) and pre-trained model BERT.
   During the construction of the heterogeneous review graph, we consider
   both the co-occurrence relationship and semantic relationship between
   words to enrich the graph information. The graph embedding of the
   reviews are obtained through SGCN and input to BERT together with word
   embeddings. Global and local information containing lexical-semantic
   interact through different layers of BERT, allowing them to influence
   and build the final classification representation jointly mutually.
   Comprehensive tests on four public datasets show that our method
   outperforms previous methods and has good generalization capability.

AB The higher requirements for deep neural networks are driving researchers
   to have a deeper understanding of the internals of neural networks. The
   class activation map (CAM) based methods can provide a convincing
   interpretation of the features extracted by the neural network from both
   visual and quantitative perspectives. However, the existing CAM methods
   do not take into account that the non-target region also contains
   target-related activation, which results in the generated saliency map
   containing noise from unrelated regions. In addition, the soft mask with
   continuous value not only contains more non-target regions for
   gradient-free CAM, but also causes the characteristics and distribution
   of the target region to be disturbed. This paper proposed a novel CAM
   method named Bipolar Information CAM (BI-CAM) to interpret convolutional
   neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly,
   dual-stream information is proposed to precisely quantify the
   relationship between the target region and the non-target region for an
   image/graph. Secondly, binary reformation is also proposed to generate a
   hard mask that can retain the original features and regions. Finally, we
   propose to use concise and effective Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)
   to measure the quantitative relationship between the image and the local
   region with respect to the label. The results of the experiment show
   that the proposed BI-CAM achieves significantly better performance in
   the faithfulness evaluation from the perspectives of visualization and
   quantitative analysis than other competitive interpretation methods.

AB Monocular RGB-based 3D hand pose estimation is n is crucial for a wide
   range of augmented reality and human-computer interaction applications.
   However, this task is highly challenging due to occlusion, scale, and
   depth ambiguities. Most existing methods mainly focus on estimating a
   scale-normalized root-relative 3D pose from the cropped hand image. In
   this work, we propose a multi-stage GCN-based (Graph Convolutional
   Networks) approach to estimate the absolute 3D hand pose from a single
   RGB image. We exploit both the cropped hand and the global scene image,
   which provides clues about the hand scale and location in the camera
   space. Our network consists of three main stages: 2D key-points, 3D
   root-relative, and 3D absolute pose estimation. To achieve better
   performance, we propose a new loss function. It separates the extracted
   image features based on 3D joint locations to simplify the regression
   task. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that our
   efficient model estimates accurate global 3D hand poses and performs
   favorably against several baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Also,
   we validate the proposed approach on a newly created dataset. It
   contains RGB hand images with accurate 3D pose annotations and high
   lighting and poses variations.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) devices have limited resources and are
   vulnerable to attacks, so optimizing their network topology to resist
   random failures and malicious attacks has become a key issue. The
   scale-free network model has strong resistance to random attacks, but it
   is very vulnerable to malicious attacks. The existing studies mostly
   adopt heuristic algorithms to optimize the ability of scale-free
   networks to resist malicious attacks, but their high computational cost
   cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the real IoT. Therefore, this
   paper proposes an intelligent topology robustness optimization model
   based on a graph convolutional network (ROGCN). The model extracts the
   onion-like structural features of the highly robust network topology
   from the data set through supervised learning, and on this basis,
   different search strategies are designed to meet the needs of different
   IoT scenarios. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that ROGCN
   can more effectively improve the robustness of scale-free IoT networks
   against malicious attacks compared to two existing heuristic algorithms,
   with a lower computational cost.

AB Spectral unmixing is an effective tool to mine information at the
   subpixel level from complex hyperspectral images. To consider the
   spatially correlated materials distributions in the scene, many
   algorithms unmix the data in a spatial-spectral fashion; however,
   existing models are usually unable to model spectral variability
   simultaneously. In this article, we present a variational
   autoencoder-based deep generative model for spatial-spectral unmixing
   (DGMSSU) with endmember variability, by linking the generated endmembers
   to the probability distributions of endmember bundles extracted from the
   hyperspectral imagery via discriminators. Besides the convolutional
   autoencoder-like architecture that can only model the spatial
   information within the regular patch inputs, DGMSSU is able to
   alternatively choose graph convolutional networks or self-attention
   mechanism modules to handle the irregular but more flexible
   data-superpixel. Experimental results on a simulated dataset, as well as
   two well-known real hyperspectral images, show the superiority of our
   proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art
   spatial-spectral unmixing methods. Compared to the conventional unmixing
   methods that consider the endmember variability, our proposed model
   generates more accurate endmembers on each subimage by the adversarial
   training process. The codes of this work will be available at
   https://github.com/shuaikaishi/DGMSSU for the sake of reproducibility.

AB Capturing global contextual representations in remote sensing images by
   exploiting long-range pixel-pixel dependencies has been shown to improve
   segmentation performance. However, how to do this efficiently is an open
   question as current approaches of utilizing attention schemes, or very
   deep models to increase the field of view, increases complexity and
   memory consumption. Inspired by recent work on graph neural networks, we
   propose the Self-Constructing Graph (SCG) module that learns a
   long-range dependency graph directly from the image data and uses it to
   capture global contextual information efficiently to improve semantic
   segmentation. The SCG module provides a high degree of flexibility for
   constructing segmentation networks that seamlessly make use of the
   benefits of variants of graph neural networks (GNN) and convolutional
   neural networks (CNN). Our SCG-GCN model, a variant of SCG-Net built
   upon graph convolutional networks (GCN), performs semantic segmentation
   in an end-to-end manner with competitive performance on the publicly
   available ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets, achieving a mean
   F1-scores of 92.0% and 89.8%, respectively. We conclude that the SCG-Net
   is an attractive architecture for semantic segmentation of remote
   sensing images since it achieves competitive performance with much fewer
   parameters and lower computational cost compared to related models based
   on convolutional neural networks.

AB A protein complex is a group of associated polypeptide chains which
   plays essential roles in the biological process. Given a graph
   representing protein-protein interactions (PPI) network, it is critical
   but non-trivial to detect protein complexes, the subsets of proteins
   that are tightly coupled, from it. Network embedding is a technique to
   learn low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks. It has
   been proved quite useful for community detection in social networks in
   recent years. However, unlike social networks, PPI network does not
   contain rich metadata, so that existing network embedding methods cannot
   fully capture the network structure of PPI to improve the effect of
   protein complexes detection significantly. We propose a semi-supervised
   network embedding model by adopting graph convolutional networks to
   detect densely connected subgraphs effectively. We compare the
   performance of our model with state-of-the-art approaches on three
   popular PPI networks with various data sizes and densities. The
   experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
   other approaches on all three PPI networks.

AB Falls are a growing issue in society and has become a hot topic in the
   healthcare domain. Falls are more likely to occur to due to age or
   health problems such as cardiovascular issues and muscle weakness. In
   this work we focus on fall detection. The aftereffects of falls often
   lead to the use of prescription pain medications. We are motivated to
   help prevent suicide attempts by overdose in the Canadian correctional
   services. Most previous studies were based on hand-crafted features
   which limit the robustness and generality of the system. We therefore
   propose a general vision-based system, using Spatial Temporal Graph
   Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN). This system has proven its efficiency
   and robustness in the action recognition domain. Contrary to previous
   works, this model can be applied directly to new data without the need
   to retrain the model while offering good accuracy. Additionally, with
   the help of transfer learning we can solve the insufficient data
   problem. By using three public datasets: the NTU RGB-D dataset, the TST
   Fall detection dataset v2 and the Fallfree dataset to validate our
   method, we achieved a 100% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art.

AB The objective imbalance between the taxi supply and demand exists in
   various areas of the city. Accurately predicting this imbalance helps
   taxi companies with dispatching, thereby increasing their profits and
   meeting the travel needs of residents. The application of Graph
   Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in traffic forecasting has inspired the
   development of a spatial-temporal model for grid-level prediction of the
   taxi demand-supply imbalance. However, spatial-temporal GCN prediction
   models conventionally capture only static inter-grid correlation
   features. This research aims to address the dynamic influences caused by
   taxi mobility and the variations of other transportation modes on the
   demand-supply dynamics between grids. To achieve this, we employ taxi
   trajectory data and develop a model that incorporates dynamic GCN and
   Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to predict grid-level imbalances. This
   model captures the dynamic inter-grid influences between neighboring
   grids in the spatial dimension. It also identifies trends and periodic
   changes in the temporal dimension. The validation of this model, using
   taxi trajectory data from Shenzhen city, indicates superior performance
   compared to classical time-series models and spatial-temporal GCN
   models. An ablation study is conducted to analyze the impact of various
   factors on the predictive accuracy. This study demonstrates the
   precision and applicability of the proposed model.

AB Driver activity engagement while driving plays a vital role that leads
   to negative outcomes of driving safety. To reduce traffic accidents and
   ensure driving safety, real-time driver activity recognition
   architecture is proposed in this study. Specifically, a total of eight
   kinds of common driving-related activities are identified, which include
   the normal driving, left or right checking, texting, answering the
   phone, using media, drinking, and picking up objects. Raw experiment
   videos are collected via onboard monocular cameras, which are used for
   the upper body skeleton information extraction of the driver. Then, the
   graph convolutional networks (GCN) are constructed for spatial structure
   feature reasoning in a single frame, which is consecutively followed by
   long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal motion feature
   learning within the sequence. Moreover, the attention mechanism is
   further utilised to emphasise the keyframes to select discriminative
   sequential information. Finally, a large-scale driver activity dataset,
   consisting of both naturalistic driving data and simulative driving
   data, is collected for model training and evaluations. Experimental
   results show that the general recall ratio of those eight
   driving-related activities reaches up to 88.8% and the real-time
   recognition efficiency can reach up to 24 fps, which would satisfy the
   real-time requirements of engineering applications.

AB The removal of refractory contaminants such as tetracycline (TC)
   antibiotics from wastewater has drawn a lot of interest. Semi-ionic
   mesoporous F-doped g-C3N4(e.g. GCN-F0.50) photocatalysts were
   successfully fabricated with different doping amounts. The GCN-F0.50
   shows the highest TC removal performance under visible light irradiation
   (lambda > 420 nm), which is 99.8% (0.0207 min(-1)) of removal in 180
   min. The highest COD removal of TC was 75.9% using GCN-F0.50
   photocatalyst. This is because the semi-ionic nature of the C-F bond has
   high polarity, which is capable of promoting good charge separation and
   migration. It was found that GCN-F0.50 provides a high mesoporous
   surface area (79.66 m(2)/g) to allow more TC pollutants to be
   photodegraded on the surface. In addition, the optical absorption is
   enhanced due to bandgap narrowing (2.55 eV). This work provides a highly
   efficient and good reusability photocatalyst for TC removal based on
   F-doped g-C3N4. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

   language processing as it requires more reasoning ability across
   multiple documents. Spectral models based on graph convolutional
   networks have shown good inferring abilities and lead to competitive
   results. However, the analysis and reasoning of some are inconsistent
   with those of humans. Inspired by the concept of grandmother cells in
   cognitive neuroscience, we propose a heterogeneous graph attention
   network model named ClueReader to imitate the grandmother cell concept.
   The model is designed to assemble the semantic features in multi-level
   representations and automatically concentrate or alleviate information
   for reasoning through the attention mechanism. The name ClueReader is a
   metaphor for the pattern of the model: it regards the subjects of
   queries as the starting points of clues, takes the reasoning entities as
   bridge points, considers the latent candidate entities as grandmother
   cells, and the clues end up in candidate entities. The proposed model
   enables the visualization of the reasoning graph, making it possible to
   analyze the importance of edges connecting entities and the selectivity
   in the mention and candidate nodes, which is easier to comprehend
   empirically. Evaluations on the open-domain multi-hop reading dataset
   WikiHop and drug-drug interaction dataset MedHop proved the validity of
   ClueReader and showed the feasibility of its application of the model in
   the molecular biology domain.

AB The application of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to hyperspectral
   image (HSI) classification is a heavily researched topic. However, GCNs
   are based on spectral filters, which are computationally costly and fail
   to suppress noise effectively. In addition, the current GCN-based
   methods are prone to oversmoothing (the representation of each node
   tends to be congruent) problems. To circumvent these problems, a novel
   semi-supervised locality-preserving dense graph neural network (GNN)
   with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) filters and context-aware
   learning (DARMA-CAL) is proposed for HSI classification. In this work,
   we introduce the ARMA filter instead of a spectral filter to apply to
   GNNs. The ARMA filter can better capture the global graph structure and
   is more robust to noise. More importantly, the ARMA filter can simplify
   calculations compared with the spectral filter. In addition, we show
   that the ARMA filter can be approximated by a recursive method.
   Furthermore, we propose a dense structure, which not only implements the
   ARMA filter in the structure, but is also locality-preserving. Finally,
   we design a layerwise context-aware learning mechanism to extract the
   useful local information generated by each layer of the dense ARMA
   network. The experimental results on three real HSI datasets show that
   DARMA-CAL outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods.

AB Nowadays, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are getting more attention
   in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), and various algorithms
   based on GCNs have been proposed. However, because of hyperspectral
   images' (HSIs) complex spatial texture information, the long-range graph
   convolution (GConv) and short-range GConv may cause inaccurate or
   oversmoothed feature extraction of some nodes. Thus, a multiscale short-
   and long range graph convolutional network (MSLGCN) is proposed for
   HSIC. First, MSLGCN not only extracts spatial information of ground
   objects at different scales but also simultaneously captures global and
   local spectral features, which preserves objects' fine boundaries. Then,
   the rich multiscale information is complementary, enabling the MSLGCN to
   take full advantage of texture structures of varying sizes. In addition,
   a method to determine the superpixel scale by the intrinsic properties
   of HSIs is proposed to ensure that the segmentation boundary depicts the
   texture structure of the object accurately. Finally, the short-long
   graph convolution (SLGConv) is designed to fuse the advantages of global
   and local features, enabling the MSLGCN to extract accurate
   spatial-spectral features of nodes at any location. Experiments on three
   HSI datasets indicate that the MSLGCN can obtain better classification
   performance when compared with the other 11 state-of-the-art methods.

AB Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is important for users to
   help them find interesting venues to visit in the near future. Most
   previous work on this subject has incorporated geographical and temporal
   information into sequential patterns to predict next POIs. However, few
   studies have considered the influence of important factors such as
   users' reviews or POIs' popularity on sequential patterns, nor
   distinguished between factors of different importance for prediction. In
   addition, the relationships between entities in location-based social
   networks have been ignored in most previous work. To overcome these
   limitations, we proposed a model called MGCAN to flexibly incorporate
   various influential factors into different sequential patterns for next
   POI recommendation. We first used multiple graph convolutional networks
   and independent attention networks to model multiple sequential patterns
   with different influential factors. Furthermore, we designed
   corresponding modules to simultaneously capture general preferences of
   users and determine the impact of different influential factors on each
   user. Finally, we used multiple sequential patterns and the general
   preferences of users in the prediction module to predict the next POI.
   Experimental results on two datasets showed that the MGCAN model
   achieved better recommendation performance than benchmark models.

AB Basketball is a popular sport worldwide, and many researchers have
   utilized various machine learning models to predict the outcome of
   basketball games. However, prior research has primarily focused on
   traditional machine learning models. Furthermore, models that rely on
   vector inputs tend to ignore the intricate interactions between teams
   and the spatial structure of the league. Therefore, this study aimed to
   apply graph neural networks to basketball game outcome prediction, by
   transforming structured data into unstructured graphs, to represent the
   interactions between teams in the 2012-2018 NBA season dataset.
   Initially, the study used a homogeneous network and undirected graph to
   build a team representation graph. The constructed graph was fed into a
   graph convolutional network, which yielded an average success rate of
   66.90% in predicting the outcome of games. To improve the prediction
   success rate, feature extraction based on the random forest algorithm
   was combined with the model. The fused model yielded the best results,
   and the prediction accuracy was improved to 71.54%. Additionally, the
   study compared the results of the developed model with previous studies
   and the baseline model. Our proposed method considers the spatial
   structure of teams and the interaction between teams, resulting in
   superior performance in basketball game outcome prediction. The results
   of this study provide valuable insights for basketball performance
   prediction research.

AB Graph networks are naturally suitable for modeling multi-channel
   features of EEG signals. However, the existing study that attempts to
   utilize graph-based neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition
   doesn't take the spatio-temporal redundancy of EEG features and
   differences in brain topology into account. In this paper, we propose
   EEG-GCN, a paradigm that adopts spatio-temporal and self-adaptive graph
   convolutional networks for single and multi-view EEG-based emotion
   recognition. With spatio-temporal attention mechanism employed, EEG-GCN
   can adaptively capture significant sequential segments and spatial
   location information in EEG signals. Meanwhile, a self-adaptive brain
   network adjacency matrix is designed to quantify the connection strength
   between the channels, in which way to represent the diverse activation
   patterns under different emotion scenarios. Additionally, we propose a
   multi-view EEG-based emotion recognition method, which effectively
   integrates the diverse features of EEG signals. Extensive experiments
   conducted on two benchmark datasets SEED and DEAP demonstrate that our
   proposed method outperforms other representative methods from both
   single and multiple views.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an increasingly important research
   area in applied autonomous driving and social robotics. Effectively
   modeling the intricate interactions between pedestrians is paramount for
   improving trajectory prediction accuracy. However, when using Graph
   Neural Networks(GNNs) to model these interactions, fixed interactions
   tend to remain, preventing the graph model from making adaptive
   adjustments and thus resulting in significant discrepancies between the
   predicted and true trajectories. In this study, we propose a
   Dynamic-Evolving Relative Graph Convolutional Network(DERGCN) to predict
   the future trajectories of pedestrians. The network model captures the
   dynamically evolving pedestrian interactions and incorporates an
   evolving mechanism to simulate them. In addition, with a relative
   temporal encoding strategy employed to improve the dynamics of the graph
   further, our policy network yielded an improved predictive performance
   when tested on two challenging datasets.

AB In traditional recommender systems, we often build models based on a
   centralized storage of user data, which however will lead to user
   privacy concerns and risks. In this paper, we study an emerging and
   important recommendation problem called federated item recommendation
   (FIR), in which a recommendation model is built with decentralized data
   of user-item interactions in a privacy-aware manner, i.e., the personal
   behavior data of each user does not leave the owner. Recently, graph
   neural network (GNN) has been widely recognized as a state-of-the-art
   solution for item recommendation with implicit feedback since it is able
   to model the high-order connectivity between users and items. However,
   it is very challenging to exploit the high-order connectivity
   information in a decentralized user-item interaction graph without
   compromising user privacy. To address that, we propose a GNN-based
   federated recommendation framework, i.e., privacy-preserving graph
   convolution network (P-GCN), for the studied problem of FIR. Our P-GCN
   can leverage the high-order connectivity information like a centralized
   GCN model such as LightGCN, though it is built using a decentralized
   user-item graph. To achieve that, we design a novel privacy-preserving
   graph convolution approach based on secure aggregation and employ
   item-based user representation to compensate for the performance loss it
   causes due to the protection of user privacy. Moreover, we improve a
   group-wise concealing strategy for protecting user privacy. Empirical
   studies on three datasets show that our PGCN can achieve similar or even
   better performance comparing with the non-federated (i.e., centralized)
   counterpart, and outperforms all the existing federated methods for the
   studied problem.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Incorporating knowledge graphs in recommendation systems is promising as
   knowledge graphs can be a side information for recommendation systems to
   alleviate the sparsity and the cold start problems. However, existing
   works essentially assume that side information (i.e., knowledge graphs)
   is completed, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile,
   semantic hierarchies implied in applications are prevalent, and many
   existing approaches fail to model this semantic characteristic. Modeling
   the semantic structure between items in recommendation systems is a
   crucial challenge. Therefore, it is crucial to solve the incompleteness
   of knowledge graphs when integrating it into recommendation system as
   well as to represent the hierarchical structure contained in items. In
   this paper, we propose Paguridae, a framework that utilizes the item
   recommendation task to assist link prediction task. A core idea of the
   Paguridae is that two tasks automatically share the potential features
   between items and entities. We adopt two main structures to model the
   hierarchy between items and entities. In order to model the hierarchy in
   items, we adopt graph convolutional networks as a representation
   learning method. In order to model the hierarchy in entities, we use
   Hirec model, which maps entities into the polar coordinate system. Under
   the framework, users can get better recommendations and knowledge graphs
   can be completed as these two tasks have a mutual effect. Experiments on
   two real-world datasets show that the Paguridae can be trained
   substantially, improving F1-score by 62.51% and precision by 49.31%
   compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Skeleton-based action recognition has recently achieved much attention
   since they can robustly convey the action information. Recently, many
   studies have shown that graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which
   generalize CNNs to more generic non-Euclidean structures, are more
   exactly extracts spatial feature. Nevertheless, how to effectively
   extract global temporal features is still a challenge. In this work,
   firstly, a unique feature named temporal action graph is designed. It
   first attempts to express timing relationship with the form of graph.
   Secondly, temporal adaptive graph convolution structure (T-AGCN) are
   proposed. Through generating global adjacency matrix for temporal action
   graph, it can flexibly extract global temporal features in temporal
   dynamics. Thirdly, we further propose a novel model named
   spatial-temporal adaptive graph convolutional network (ST-AGCN) for
   skeletons-based action recognition to extract spatial-temporal feature
   and improve action recognition accuracy. ST-AGCN combines T-AGCN with
   spatial graph convolution to make up for the shortage of T-AGCN for
   spatial structure. Besides, ST-AGCN uses dual features to form a
   two-stream network which is able to further improve action recognition
   accuracy for hard-to-recognition sample. Finally, comparsive experiments
   on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets, NTU-RGBD and SBU,
   demonstrate that T-AGCN and temporal action graph can effective explore
   global temporal information and ST-AGCN achieves certain improvement of
   recognition accuracy on both datasets.

AB An enhanced label propagation (LP) method called GraphHop was proposed
   recently. It outperforms graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in the
   semi-supervised node classification task on various networks. Although
   the performance of GraphHop was explained intuitively with joint node
   attribute and label signal smoothening, its rigorous mathematical
   treatment is lacking. In this paper, we propose a label efficient
   regularization and propagation (LERP) framework for graph node
   classification, and present an alternate optimization procedure for its
   solution. Furthermore, we show that GraphHop only offers an approximate
   solution to this framework and has two drawbacks. First, it includes all
   nodes in the classifier training without taking the reliability of
   pseudo-labeled nodes into account in the label update step. Second, it
   provides a rough approximation to the optimum of a subproblem in the
   label aggregation step. Based on the LERP framework, we propose a new
   method, named the LERP method, to solve these two shortcomings. LERP
   determines reliable pseudo-labels adaptively during the alternate
   optimization and provides a better approximation to the optimum with
   computational efficiency. Theoretical convergence of LERP is guaranteed.
   Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of LERP. That is, LERP outperforms all benchmarking methods,
   including GraphHop, consistently on five common test datasets, two
   large-scale networks, and an object recognition task at extremely low
   label rates (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 labeled samples per class).

AB Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. However,
   most of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the
   relations between images and consider each input image independently.
   Intuitively, relations between images can help to understand the images
   and maintain model consistency over related images, leading to better
   explainability. In this paper, we consider modeling the image-level
   relations to generate more informative image representations, and
   propose ImageGCN, an end-to-end graph convolutional network framework
   for inductive multi-relational image modeling. We apply ImageGCN to
   chest X-ray images where rich relational information is available for
   disease identification. Unlike previous image representation models,
   ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original
   pixel features and its relationship with other images. Besides learning
   informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for
   object detection in a weakly supervised manner. The experimental results
   on 3 open-source x-ray datasets, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR
   demonstrate that ImageGCN can outperform respective baselines in both

AB This work proposes the use of I-N - A (I-N: identity matrix; A:
   adjacency matrix), instead of I-N + A, the normalized form of which has
   intensively been used for the construction of graph convolutional
   networks (GCNs), in deep-learning chemistry. The performance of the GCN
   model with D-1/2(I-N - A)D-1/2 in its convolution step is at least on a
   par with the vanilla GCN that uses (D) over tilde (-1/2)(I-N + A)(D)
   over tilde (-1/2) ((D) over tilde: degree matrix of I-N + A) in various
   chemistry datasets, such as FreeSolv, ESOL, lipophilicity, and
   blood-brain barrier penetration datasets. It could be seen that the use
   of I-N - A might be more chemically intuitive than the use of I-N + A,
   potentially embracing the information on bond properties, such as dipole
   moment, and functional groups in a molecule. This work suggests
   unavoidable necessity of tackling molecular-representation problems in
   deep-learning chemistry from unprecedented angles of view for advanced
   development and construction of chemically intuitive deep-learning
   models.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown great potential in
   recommender systems. GCN models contain multiple layers of graph
   convolutions to exploit signals from higher-order neighbors. In each
   graph convolution, the embedding of a user or item is influenced by its
   directly connected neighbors. Some of the main problems with this
   approach are as follows. First, too many graph convolutional layers make
   different users or items have similar embeddings. Second, the obtained
   interaction data have some unfavorable characteristics, such as the
   sparsity of the data, the noise inside the data, and the distribution
   skewness of the data, that may impair the model's performance. This
   paper proposes an interest-aware contrastive-learning-based GCN (IC-GCN)
   model. IC-GCN applies an interest-aware mechanism, divides users into
   different subgraphs according to their interests, and performs
   multilayer graph convolution on the subgraphs, where all collaborative
   signals received from multi-hop neighbors are positive. Furthermore,
   IC-GCN takes the contrastive learning task as an auxiliary task, where
   the interest-aware encoder receives two modified graphs generated by
   applying the node dropout operator on the full interaction graph. These
   two graphs generate two sets of embeddings as two additional views of
   the nodes. The contrastive learning loss function compares these two
   sets of embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of our model.

AB With the deterioration of the transportation ecosystem and traffic
   congestion, traffic graph representations become more complex and lack
   intelligibility. The deep learning method provides a new way for traffic
   prediction by mining the spatiotemporal relations of historical states
   in traffic network. Recurrent neural networks based on gate control can
   avoid the gradient vanishing and graph convolutional networks provide
   theoretical support for spatial feature extraction of traffic graph.
   However, in the prediction of traffic evolution behaviors, the statuses
   of units and groups distributed in the traffic network have strong and
   continuous spatiotemporal correlations. Modeling only based on the
   temporal or spatial perspective usually lacks comprehensiveness and
   semantic relevance which results in poor prediction performance. In this
   paper, we propose a spatiotemporal hierarchical propagation graph
   convolutional network(SHPGCN) to get the whole spatiotemporal evolution
   features of traffic graph, which can be used to predict the propagation
   effects and state changes of traffic flow. Considered the inadequacy of
   graph convolution in the learning of hierarchical features, we construct
   a low-dimensional propagation graph representation that projects complex
   node relationships into first-order neighborhoods to capture dynamic
   changes at different spatial and temporal scales. The SHPGCN uses graph
   convolution to encode the traffic propagation features and embeds them
   into a bidirectional recurrent sequence for traffic prediction. The
   experiment results show that SHPGCN can provide good prediction accuracy
   and robustness for the traffic evolution behaviors.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs)
   have demonstrated convincing performance on many tasks by learning the
   intrinsic structure of the data. However, it is still valuable and
   challenging to consider the complex and complete correlations of
   objects, i.e., high-order manifold structures, for representation
   learning. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning
   method that utilizes the optimized high-order manifold of the data for
   classification tasks of nonstructural data and graph-structure data. In
   the method, we fully explore the complicated relationship of samples by
   highlighting the high-order manifold information in a hypergraph.
   Specifically, we incorporate high-order manifold information by graph
   p-Laplacian into a hypergraph and propose p-Laplacian-based hypergraph
   neural networks (pLapHGNN) to significantly learn hidden layer
   representations that encode both the high-order structure of data and
   the high-order manifold geometrical information. Confronting the
   difficulties of obtaining optimized high-order manifolds of the data, we
   propose an effective approximate approach by graph p-Laplacian
   representing the relationship of hyperedges in the hypergraph.
   Furthermore, we study the weights of hyperedges in a hypergraph with
   high-order manifold information. Experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset
   and NTU dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective
   than the other popular methods for 3D shape recognition. Extensive
   experiments on other visual classification tasks and citation networks
   also show the superiority of our proposed method for representation
   learning.

AB Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a significant part of prevalent
   task-oriented dialogue systems, which monitor the user's goals based on
   current and previous dialogues for effective dialogue management.
   However, most existing approaches train DST on a single domain, ignoring
   the information across domains, and thus relevant slots in each domain
   must learn to cooperate. This paper deals this challenge by introducing
   a multi-view graph convolution and multi-agent reinforcement learning
   (MGCRL) method to help each domain-specific slot to learn to cooperate.
   Specifically, first, a multi-view graph is presented to provide more
   related information to transfer structured features among
   domain-specific slots across various domains. Compared with a
   single-view graph, multi-view has better complementarity, incorporating
   additional graphs for learning multiple types of association, thus
   improving the cross-domain information-sharing capability of DST models.
   On this basis, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method is presented
   to train DST models. Compared to current reinforcement learning methods
   used in DST models, the proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning
   utilizing multi-view graph convolutional networks allows each agent to
   learn to cooperate in multi-agent environments. Experimental results on
   the widely-used datasets MultiWOZ (Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz) 2.0/2.1
   demonstrate that the proposed MGCRL method achieves a higher joint goal
   accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art DST models.

AB Identifying cancer driver genes plays a curial role in the development
   of precision oncology and cancer therapeutics. Although a plethora of
   methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the complex cancer
   mechanisms and intricate interactions between genes still make the
   identification of cancer driver genes challenging. In this work, we
   propose a novel machine learning method of heterophilic graph diffusion
   convolutional networks (called HGDCs) to boost cancer-driver gene
   identification. Specifically, HGDC first introduces graph diffusion to
   generate an auxiliary network for capturing the structurally similar
   nodes in a biomolecular network. Then, HGDC designs an improved message
   aggregation and propagation scheme to adapt to the heterophilic setting
   of biomolecular networks, alleviating the problem of driver gene
   features being smoothed by its neighboring dissimilar genes. Finally,
   HGDC uses a layer-wise attention classifier to predict the probability
   of one gene being a cancer driver gene. In the comparison experiments
   with other existing state-of-the-art methods, our HGDC achieves
   outstanding performance in identifying cancer driver genes. The
   experimental results demonstrate that HGDC not only effectively
   identifies well-known driver genes on different networks but also novel
   candidate cancer genes. Moreover, HGDC can effectively prioritize cancer
   driver genes for individual patients. Particularly, HGDC can identify
   patient-specific additional driver genes, which work together with the
   well-known driver genes to cooperatively promote tumorigenesis.

AB Traditional recommendation systems usually use single user-item
   interaction information, which ignore the multiple relationships that
   exist for other interactions (e.g., likes, clicks). Multi-behavioral
   recommendation models compensate for the shortcomings of traditional
   models. The existing multi-behavior recommendation models focus on
   obtaining behavioral information by distinguishing the interaction
   differences of multiple user behaviors but ignore the common preferences
   of items related to user different interactions. In this paper, we
   propose a Multi-Behavior Heterogeneous Contrastive learning
   Recommendation (MBHCR) model. Specifically, MBHCR stresses the
   information fusion between different interaction behaviors and
   differences in the behavior view. Firstly, we design a unified
   heterogeneous graph based on the complexity of user multi-behavioral
   interaction information to distinguish behavioral differences while
   preserving their complete semantic information. Secondly, we propose a
   multi-behavior relational aggregator component to model the unified
   heterogeneous graph only once to capture the potential common
   representations of users and their different interactions and to
   mitigate user sparsity. Thirdly, we also design a behavior comparison
   learning enhancer to complement the interaction differences between the
   user's target behavior and auxiliary behaviors on the behavior view and
   extract valid information. Experiments were conducted on two real-world
   datasets to demonstrate the validity of MBHCR and designed ablation
   experiments to verify the contribution of model components.

AB Nowadays, individuals spend significant time on online social networks
   and microblogging websites, consuming news and expressing their opinions
   and viewpoints on various topics. It is an excellent source of data for
   various data mining applications, such as sentiment analysis. Mining
   this type of data presents several challenges, including the posts'
   short length and informal language. On the other hand, microblog posts
   contain a high degree of interdependence, which can help to improve
   sentiment classification based on text. This data can be represented as
   a graph, with nodes representing posts and edges representing the
   various relationships between them. By using recently developed deep
   learning models for graph structures, this approach enables efficient
   sentiment analysis of microblog posts. This paper utilizes graphs to
   represent microblog posts and their various relationships, such as user,
   friendship, hashtag, sentimental similarity, textual similarity, and
   common friends. It then employs graph neural networks to perform
   context-aware sentiment analysis. To make use of the knowledge contained
   in multiple graphs, we propose a stacking model that simultaneously
   employs multiple graph types. The findings demonstrate the relevance of
   sociological theories to the analysis of social media. Experimental
   results on HCR (a real-world Twitter sentiment analysis dataset),
   indicate that the proposed approach outperforms baselines and
   state-of-the-art models.

AB The main core purpose of artificial emotional intelligence is to
   recognize human emotions. Technologies such as facial, semantic, or
   brainwave recognition applications have been widely proposed. However,
   the abovementioned recognition techniques for emotional features require
   a large number of training samples to obtain high accuracy. Human
   behaviour pattern can be trained and recognized by the continuous
   movement of the Spatial Temporal Graph Convolution Network (ST-GCN).
   However, this technology does not distinguish between the speed of
   delicate emotions, and the speed of human behaviour and delicate changes
   of emotions cannot be effectively distinguished. This research paper
   proposes Spatial Temporal Variation Convolutional Network training for
   human emotion recognition, using skeleton detection technology to
   calculate the degree of skeleton point change between consecutive
   actions and using the nearest neighbour algorithm to classify speed
   levels and train the ST-GCN recognition model to obtain the emotional
   state. Application of the speed change recognition ability of the
   Spatial Temporal Variation Graph Convolution Network (STV-GCN) to
   artificial emotional intelligence calculation makes it possible to
   efficiently recognize the delicate actions of happy, sad, fear, and
   angry in human behaviour. The STV-GCN technology proposed in this paper
   is compared with ST-GCN and can effectively improve the recognition
   accuracy by more than 50%.

AB In response to the problem that current multi-city multi-pollutant
   prediction methods based on one-dimensional undirected graph neural
   network models cannot accurately reflect the two-dimensional spatial
   correlations and directedness, this study proposes a four-dimensional
   directed graph model that can capture the two-dimensional spatial
   directed information and node correlation information related to
   multiple factors, as well as extract temporal correlation information at
   different times. Firstly, A four-dimensional directed GCN model with
   directed information graph in two-dimensional space was established
   based on the geographical location of the city. Secondly, Spectral
   decomposition and tensor operations were then applied to the
   two-dimensional directed information graph to obtain the graph Fourier
   coefficients and graph Fourier basis. Thirdly, the graph filter of the
   four-dimensional directed GCN model was further improved and optimized.
   Finally, an LSTM network architecture was introduced to construct the
   four-dimensional directed GCN-LSTM model for synchronous extraction of
   spatio-temporal information and prediction of atmospheric pollutant
   concentrations. The study uses the 2020 atmospheric six-parameter data
   of the Taihu Lake city cluster and applies canonical correlation
   analysis to confirm the data's temporal, spatial, and multi-factor
   correlations. Through experimentation, it is verified that the proposed
   4D-DGCN-LSTM model achieves a MAE reduction of 1.12%, 4.91%, 5.62%, and
   11.67% compared with the 4D-DGCN, GCN-LSTM, GCN, and LSTM models,
   respectively, indicating the good performance of the 4D-DGCN-LSTM model
   in predicting multiple types of atmospheric pollutants in various

AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays a critical role in many
   scientific and engineering applications, with aerodynamic design
   optimization being a primary area of interest. Recently, there has been
   much interest in using artificial intelligence approaches to accelerate
   this process. One promising method is the graph convolutional neural
   network (GCN), a deep learning method based on artificial neural
   networks (ANNs). In this paper, we propose a novel GCN-based aerodynamic
   design optimization acceleration framework, GCN-based aerodynamic design
   optimization acceleration framework. The framework significantly
   improves processing efficiency by optimizing data flow and data
   representation. We also introduce a network model called GCN4CFD that
   uses the GCF framework to create a compact data representation of the
   flow field and an encoder-decoder structure to extract features. This
   approach enables the model to learn underlying physical laws in a
   space-time efficient manner. We then evaluate the proposed method on an
   airfoil aerodynamic design optimization task and show that GCN4CFD
   provides a significant speedup compared to traditional CFD solvers while
   maintaining accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate the
   robustness of the proposed framework and network model, achieving a
   speedup average of 3.0 x.

AB In some complex labor production and human-machine interactions, such as
   subway driving, to ensure both the efficient and rapid completion of
   work and the personal safety of staff and the integrity of operating
   equipment, the level of mental workload (MW) of operators is monitored
   at all times. In existing machine learning-based MW classification
   methods, the association information between neurons in different
   regions is almost not considered. To solve the above problem, a graph
   convolution network based on the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block is
   proposed. For a raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, the principal
   component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction operation is carried
   out. After that, combined with the spatial distribution between brain
   electrodes, the dimensionality reduction data can be converted to graph
   structure data, carrying association information between neurons in
   different regions. In addition, we use graph convolution neural network
   (GCN) modified by SE residual to obtain final classification results.
   Here, to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by
   explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels, the SE block is
   introduced. The residual connection can ease the training of networks.
   To discuss the performance of the proposed method, we carry out some
   experiments using the raw EEG signals of 10 healthy subjects, which are
   collected using the MATB-II platform based on multi-task aerial context
   manipulation. From the experiment results, the structural reasonableness
   and the performance superiority of the proposed method are verified. In
   short, the proposed GCN modified by the SE residual method is a workable
   plan of mental workload classification.

AB The radiation of adjacent field sources has a specific spatial
   correlation. In order to suppress electromagnetic disturbance and
   improve the electromagnetic compatibility of secondary equipment, the
   electric field's spatial coupling characteristics and distribution law
   should be mastered. Therefore, a method for predicting the spatial
   electric field generated by substation switching operation based on the
   Atomic Orbital Search-Graph Convolution Network- Long and Short-Term
   Memory (AOS-GCN-LSTM) model is presented to deal with this problem.
   First, the GCN is used to construct graph data according to node
   characteristics and topology information. The feature selection uses the
   Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC) to extract the spatial correlation
   of the adjacent field source radiation. At the same time, the LSTM is
   used to capture the temporal correlation characteristics of different
   position field strengths in space. Then, the AOS is used to optimize the
   model with a hyperparameter. In addition, the simulation data of the
   full-wave simulation model of the spatial electric field generated by
   switch operation in a 220 kV GIS substation is an example of
   verification. The results show that the prediction error of the proposed
   method is below 3%, and it has strong adaptability to the application
   environment and good prediction performance.

AB The possibility of using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a chemical oxidizer
   or as a green liquid fuel to produce electricity has encouraged both the
   scientific and industrial communities to investigate green technologies
   aimed at the sustainability of the production process. In particular,
   the light-induced synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen has attracted
   significant attention using optical semiconductors.An exfoliated
   metal-free graphitic carbon nitride material (GCN-T) was prepared and
   tested for the photocatalytic production of H2O2 using five saccharides
   (arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, glucose, and sorbitol) as sacrificial
   electron donors. The results showed that the scavenging efficiency of
   the photogenerated holes rapidly increases with the number of -OH groups
   in the molecular structure of these sacrificial agents. Among the
   polyhydroxy compounds tested, the highest concentration of H2O2 was
   achieved using cellobiose.To develop a technological approach for H2O2
   production, the GCN-T photocatalyst was immobilized on a 3D printed
   structure (GCN-T/3D structure), which showed high stability with both
   ultrapure water and seawater after several reusability runs. This
   innovative photocatalytic structure enables remarkable efficiency for
   H2O2 production, with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 17% at 412
   nm radiation, compared to 12% obtained with GCN-T in suspension.

AB For a long time, the problems of cold start and sparse data have always
   been the key problems to be solved by the recommendation system.
   Researchers usually use auxiliary information to deal with the
   aforementioned problems, thereby achieving the purpose of enhancing the
   recommendation effect. For example, the multitask feature learning
   framework (MKR) uses knowledge graphs as auxiliary information to
   enhance recommendations. However, the MKR algorithm has the problem of
   insufficient semantic information representation which affect the
   recommendation results. Thus, a multitask recommendation algorithm based
   on DeepFM and graph convolutional network (DeepFM_GCN) is proposed. The
   graph convolution network is used to deeply mine auxiliary entity
   information in the knowledge graph to supplement the sparse item
   semantics information in the recommendation task. Through the method of
   cross compression unit combined with Deep Neural Network to achieve
   feature sharing items and entities which to make up for the impact of
   insufficient feature representation. Then the DeepFM_GCN model utilizes
   DeepFM to deeply mine the interaction feature of users and items to
   avoid inaccurate items recommended to users. From the analysis of the
   experimental results, the DeepFM_GCN model can more fully explore user
   and item features, accordingly avoiding semantic ambiguity and improving
   prediction accuracy.

AB The use of heterojunctions with different semiconductors has shown to be
   an important strategy to increase the efficiency of heterogeneous
   photocatalytic processes. In this regard, heterojunctions consisting of
   ZnO/g-C3N4 (x-Zn/gCN) and ZnFe2O4/g-C3N4 (x-ZF/gCN) were synthesized in
   different mass proportions of g-C3N4 (x = 10, 50 and 80%) through the
   following simple methods combination: mixture, sonication and thermal
   treatment. Ob-servations from X-ray diffractometry (XRD),
   Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and field emission scan-ning
   electron microscope (FESEM) analyses confirmed that the materials were
   successfully formed. The g-C3N4 incorporation was important in the
   textural and optical properties modification of the heterojunctions
   produced. In addition, in the photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), it
   was possible to observe g-C3N4 influence in the 50-Zn/gCN emission
   profile changing, reducing the direct recombination rate of the
   photogenerated charges due to a probable Z-scheme mechanism. This
   catalyst demonstrated greater efficiency of photocatalytic degradation
   when compared to the remaining materials, both for cefazolin (CFZ) and
   reactive black 5 (RB5), reaching 78% and 95%, respectively, after 120
   min. Moreover, it also revealed good photostability after five
   successive cycles. 50-Zn/gCN heterojunction presents a promising
   character in photocatalytic reactions mediated by solar light for
   contaminants degradation such as pharmaceutical products and dyes and
   can be used as an alternative to minimize the effects of water pollution
   caused during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB As an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI) is able to be detected by analyzing the brain connectivity
   networks. For this reason, we devise a new framework via multi-scale
   enhanced graph convolutional network (MSE-GCN) for MCI detection, which
   integrates the structural and functional information from the diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic res-onance
   imaging (R-fMRI), respectively. Specifically, both information in the
   brain connective networks is first integrated based on the local
   weighted clustering coefficients (LWCC), which is concatenated as the
   feature vector for representing a population graph's vertice.
   Simultaneously, the gender and age infor-mation in each subject are
   integrated with the structural and functional features to construct a
   sparse graph. Then, various parallel graph convolutional network (GCN)
   layers with multiple inputs are designed from the embedding from random
   walk embeddings in the GCN to identify the essential MCI graph
   in-formation. Finally, all GCN layers' outputs are concatenated via the
   fully connection layer to perform dis-ease detection. The experimental
   results on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database show that our method is promising to detect MCI and superior to
   other competing algorithms, with a mean classification accuracy of
   90.39% in the detection tasks. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) networks, as the application of
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks to modern industry, are growing
   rapidly with the digital transformation accelerates. Mobile sensors are
   widely adopted in monitoring key information of massive IIoT networks in
   an ad hoc fashion or retrofitting on to an existing infrastructure.
   Hence, owing to the characteristics of scalability, unstable locations,
   and highly unstructured, achieving perfect prediction for mobile
   multisensor is a challenging problem. In this article, a dynamic
   space-time prediction algorithm combining temporal convolutional network
   and graph convolutional network (TCN-GCN) is proposed to provide
   reliable multiple nodes prediction for detection and maintenance in IIoT
   networks. In particularly, an adaptive learning graph process is
   exclusively designed according to the dynamic characteristics of mobile
   sensors. Moreover, the improved dilated time convolution network and
   dynamic graph convolution network (DGCN) are combined to effectively
   capture the time dependence and topology information. Furthermore, an
   advanced loss function is applied to avoid overfitting. Numerical
   simulations show that the proposed TCN-GCN prediction algorithm exhibits
   higher effectiveness in accuracy and complexity than convolutional long
   short-term memory (ConvLSTM), temporal graph convolutional network
   (T-GCN), and residual graph ConvLSTM (Graph-ResLSTM).

AB A novel method, Thermally Modified Non-Solvent Induced Phase Separation
   (T-NIPS) has been developed to fabricate translucent hollow fiber (THF)
   photocatalytic membrane for membrane's photodegradation efficiency
   enhancement. The process involves two-step temperature treatment that
   attacks crystalline property of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).
   Graphitic carbon nitride in a modified morphological structure (hollow
   nanofiber) was used as photocatalyst to investigate the effect of
   translucency on membrane's photo-degradation efficiency. UV-Vis analysis
   coupled with FTIR highlighted different crystalline phase appearance and
   membrane's translucency. The membranes showed high translu-cency,
   ranging from 60.0% to 93.9%, with THF-PVDF/PVP-GCN (2.0) exhibiting the
   highest. The filtration experiment showed that membrane with GCN
   photocatalyst had high PWF (1200 L/m2h) and rejection (90%) OPW compared
   to neat THF-PVDFs. In suspended mode, GCN demonstrated an impressive
   photodegradation efficiency of 99.98%. When im-mobilized in opaque PVDF
   membrane, the photodegradation has decreased substantially to 49.40%.
   However, when immobilized in a translucent PVDF membrane, the
   photo-degradation efficiency of HN-GCN significantly improved compared
   to the opaque PVDF membrane, reaching 95%. Translucent membrane was
   subjected to five cycle regeneration test and showed 90% recovery even
   after the fifth cycle. The 10% reduction in the recovery was
   investigated using FESEM analysis revealed that there is a cake layer
   formation on the membrane surface. Therefore, this study proved that
   translucency of membrane has significant effect on immobilized
   photocatalyst's photocatalytic efficiency.(c) 2023 Institution of

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an ideal method for eco-friendly
   synthesis of value-added chemicals. However, due to the limited
   penetration depth of photons and inefficient utilization of the
   catalytic active sites, the scalability of heterogeneous photocatalysis
   is restrained. Combining heterogeneous photocatalysis and flow system is
   a promising solution to optimize the light absorption and mass transfer;
   however, an affordable, practical design of the flow system and the
   immobilization method of the photocatalyst is still missing. Here, we
   report a flow system for heterogeneous photocatalytic synthesis of
   azoxybenzene and its derivatives from reductive coupling of nitrobenzene
   at a gram-scale using anchored graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) on porous
   silica (gCN-SiO2). The hydrogen bonds formed between the gCN and the
   tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) precursor during the dehydrative condensation
   process prevent unwanted leaching of catalyst, enabling photocatalytic
   flow synthesis of azoxybenzene with high selectivity, efficiency, and
   durability. Mechanistic studies reveals that the gCN-SiO2 regulates the
   photocatalytic reduction kinetics of nitrobenzene by facilitating the
   generation of nitrosobenzene and N-phenylhydroxylamine intermediates
   while preventing the formation of unwanted 4-phenylazophenol byproducts,
   resulting in efficient and selective synthesis of azoxybenzene. Our work
   provides an alternative path towards large scale heterogeneous
   photocatalysis.

AB Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative
   diseases that affects tens of millions of Americans. PD is highly
   progressive and heterogeneous. Quite a few studies have been conducted
   in recent years on predictive or disease progression modeling of PD
   using clinical and biomarkers data. Neuroimaging, as another important

AB Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to predict the sentiment polarity
   toward a specific aspect in a sentence. Most current approaches are
   based on deep learning and the attention mechanism. However, these
   models cannot simultaneously include the context semantic information
   carried by local words and the global syntactic information possibly
   carried by remote words. In this paper, we propose a local semantic and
   global syntactic integration scheme, which employs a local focus
   mechanism over local context words and exploits improved graph
   convolutional networks over dependency tree to encode global syntactic
   information. Moreover, multi-head attention is used to capture both the
   semantic information and also the interactive information between
   semantics and syntactic features. Experimental results on five datasets
   show the effectiveness of our model over a series of latest models.

   This task is different from the general QA task because many additional

   Multi-Feature Graph Convolutional Network model (MF-GCN) to integrate
   not only semantic features, but also mental health related features and
   context features, to match question posts and responses. Different types
   of feature are exploited through multiple graph convolutional networks.
   A new dataset is constructed for MH-QA to evaluate ourmodel.
   Experimental results showthat our model with mental health features

AB Graphene oxide (GO) has been intensively studied in last decades as a
   promising delivery nanoplatform. Although it surpasses the pristine
   graphene in its hydrophilic properties, variability in GO syntheses and
   chemical composition, its non-specific surface properties and
   heterogeneity in colloidal stability hamper its commercial application
   in general. Reliable cytotoxicity investigation of new nanotherapeutics
   under relevant physiological conditions represents an indispensable
   first step for their potential clinical translation. In the case of
   delivery nanoplatforms, the vasculature represents the first encounter
   after intravenous application. Therefore, an evaluation of interaction
   with endothelial and immune cells is highly desirable. Here, we
   performed a first comprehensive safety assessment of emerging graphene
   derivatives with high potential in biomedical technologies: graphene
   acid (GA) and cyanographene (GCN). We utilized an easy-to-use co-culture
   model of matured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a
   human monocyte/macrophage like cell line (THP-1) under dynamic flow
   conditions. An environment that has not been used yet to evaluate any
   graphene material. Our results demonstrate that well-defined
   synthesis/structure of GA and GCN overcome some drawbacks of graphene
   oxide (GO), the benchmark graphene derivative. Furthermore, applying a
   system mimicking a simplified blood vessel, both GA and GCN showed
   excellent biocompatibility without any indication of acute inflammation
   or dysfunction of endothelium. In summary, GA and GCN display so far all
   desirable properties to be potentially utilized in drug/gene delivery
   applications compared to the conventional GO.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success on
   graph-structured data. Many GCNs can be considered low-pass filters for
   graph signals. In this paper, we propose a more powerful GCN, named
   BiGCN, that extends to bidirectional filtering. Specifically, we
   consider the original graph structure information and the latent
   correlation between features. Thus BiGCN can filter the signals along
   with both the original graph and a latent feature-connection graph.
   Compared with most existing GCNs, BiGCN is more robust and has powerful
   capacities for feature denoising. We perform node classification and
   link prediction in citation networks and co-purchase networks with three
   settings: Noise-Rate, Noise-Level, and Structure-Mistakes. Extensive
   experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the
   state-of-the-art graph neural networks in both clean and artificially
   noisy data.

AB Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a complex and challenging
   task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It aims to extract the
   triplet of aspect term, opinion term, and their associated sentiment
   polarity, which is a more fine-grained study in Aspect Based Sentiment
   Analysis. Furthermore, there have been a large number of approaches
   being proposed to handle this relevant task. However, existing methods
   for ASTE suffer from powerless interactions between different sources of
   textual features, and they usually exert an equal impact on each type of
   feature, which is quite unreasonable while building contextual
   representation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
   Multi-Branch GCN (MBGCN)-based ASTE model to solve this problem.
   Specifically, our model first generates the enhanced semantic features
   via the structure-biased BERT, which takes the position of tokens into
   the transformation of self-attention. Then, a biaffine attention module
   is utilized to further obtain the specific semantic feature maps. In
   addition, to enhance the dependency among words in the sentence, four
   types of linguistic relations are defined, namely part-of-speech
   combination, syntactic dependency type, tree-based distance, and
   relative position distance of each word pair, which are further embedded
   as adjacent matrices. Then, the widely used Graph Convolutional Network
   (GCN) module is utilized to complete the work of integrating the
   semantic feature and linguistic feature, which is operated on four types
   of dependency relations repeatedly. Additionally, an effective refining
   strategy is employed to detect whether word pairs match or not, which is
   conducted after the operation of each branch GCN. At last, a shallow
   interaction layer is designed to achieve the final textual
   representation by fusing the four branch features with different
   weights. To validate the effectiveness of MBGCNs, extensive experiments
   have been conducted on four public and available datasets. Furthermore,
   the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MBGCNs,
   which obviously outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The noninvasive detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
   remains an immense challenge. Inthis study, we proposed a robust,
   accurate, and noninvasive classifier, namely Multi-Omics Co-training
   Graph Convolutional Networks (MOCO-GCN). It achieved high accuracy (0.9
   ± 0.06), F1 score (0.9± 0.07), and AUROC (0.89± 0.08), surpassing
   contemporary approaches. The performance of model was validated on an
   external cohort of German PDAC patients. Additionally, we discovered
   that the exposome may impact PDAC development through its complex
   interplay with gut microbiome by mediation analysis. For example,
   Fusobacterium hwasookii nucleatum, known for its ability to induce
   inflammatory responses, may serve as a mediator for the impact of
   rheumatoid arthritis on PDAC. Overall, our study sheds light on how
   exposome and microbiome in concert could contribute to PDAC development,
   and enable PDAC diagnosis with high fidelity and interpretability.

AB Current soil pollution prediction methods need improvement, especially
   with regard to accuracy in supplementing missing heavy-metal values in
   soil, and the accuracy and slow convergence speed of methods for
   predicting heavy-metal content at unknown points. To reduce costs and
   improve prediction accuracy, this study used two neural network models
   (SA-FOA-BP and SE-GCN) to supplement missing heavy-metal values and
   efficiently predict heavy-metal content in soil. The SA-FOA-BP model
   combines simulated annealing and fruit fly algorithms to optimize the
   parameter search method in traditional BP neural networks and improve
   prediction of missing heavy-metal values in soil. A spatial information
   fusion graph convolutional network prediction model (SE-GCN) constructs
   a spatial information encoder that can perceive spatial context
   information, and embeds it with spatial autocorrelation used for
   auxiliary learning to predict the heavy-metal content in soil. From the
   experimental results, the SE-GCN model demonstrates improved performance
   in terms of evaluation indicators compared with other models.
   Application analysis of the two improved neural network models was
   conducted; application scenarios and suitability were analyzed, showing
   that these models have practical application value for soil pollution
   prediction.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) derive inspiration from recent
   advances in computer vision, by stacking layers of first-order filters
   followed by a nonlinear activation function to learn entity or graph
   embeddings. Although GCNs have been shown to boost the performance of
   many network analysis tasks, they still face tremendous challenges in
   learning from Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), where relations
   play a decisive role in knowledge reasoning. What's more, there are
   multiaspect representations of entities in HINs, and a filter learned in
   one aspect do not necessarily apply to another. We address these
   challenges by proposing the Aspect-Aware Graph Attention Network (AGAT),
   a model that extends GCNs with alternative learnable filters to
   incorporate entity and relational information. Instead of focusing on
   learning the general entity embeddings, AGAT learns the adaptive entity
   embeddings based on prediction scenario. Experiments of link prediction
   and semi-supervised classification verify the effectiveness of our
   algorithm.

AB Evaluating the contribution of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in
   tumour progression has proven a complex challenge due to the intricate

   components simultaneously. Here we utilise a highly multiplexed dataset
   of 61 markers across 746 colorectal tumours to investigate how complex
   mTOR signalling in different tissue compartments influences patient
   prognosis. We found that the signalling of mTOR pathway can have
   heterogeneous activation patterns in tumour and immune compartments
   which correlate with patient prognosis. Using graph neural networks, we
   determined the most predictive features of mTOR activity in immune cells
   and identified relevant cellular subpopulations. We validated our
   observations using spatial transcriptomics data analysis in an
   independent patient cohort. Our work provides a framework for studying
   complex cell signalling and reveals important insights for developing
   mTOR-based therapies.

AB Multimodal models have been proven to outperform text-based models on
   learning semantic word representations. According to psycholinguistic
   theory, there is a graphical relationship among the modalities of
   language, and in recent years, the graph convolution network (GCN) has
   been proven to have substantial advantages in the extraction of
   non-European spatial features. This inspires us to propose a new
   multimodal word representation model, namely, GCNW, which uses the graph
   convolutional network to incorporate the phonetic and syntactic
   information into the word representation. We use a greedy strategy to
   update the modality-relation matrix in the GCN, and we train the model
   through unsupervised learning. We evaluated the proposed model on
   multiple downstream NLP tasks, and various experimental results
   demonstrate that the GCNW outperforms strong unimodal baselines and
   state-of-the-art multimodal models. We make the source code of both
   models available to encourage reproducible research.

AB Solving the supply-demand imbalance is the most crucial issue for stable

   by increasing the accuracy of demand prediction by considering spatial
   and temporal properties of bike demand. However, only a few attempts
   have been made to account for both features simultaneously. Therefore,
   we propose a prediction framework based on graph convolutional networks.
   Our framework reflects not only spatial dependencies among stations, but
   also various temporal patterns over different periods. Additionally, we
   consider the influence of global variables, such as weather and
   weekday/weekend to reflect non-station-level changes. We compare our

AB In the recent era, graph neural networks are widely used on
   vision-to-language tasks and achieved promising results. In particular,
   graph convolution network (GCN) is capable of capturing spatial and
   semantic relationships needed for visual question answering (VQA). But,
   applying GCN on VQA datasets with different subtasks can lead to varying
   results. Also, the training and testing size, evaluation metrics and
   hyperparameter used are other factors that affect VQA results. These,
   factors can be subjected into similar evaluation schemes in order to
   obtain fair evaluations of GCN based result for VQA. This study proposed
   a GCN framework for VQA based on fine tune word representation to solve
   handle reasoning type questions. The framework performance is evaluated
   using various performance measures. The results obtained from GQA and
   VQA 2.0 datasets slightly outperform most existing methods.

AB Graph embedding, aiming to learn low-dimensional representations (aka.
   embeddings) of nodes in graphs, has received significant attention. In
   recent years, there has been a surge of efforts, among which graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as an effective class of
   models. However, these methods mainly focus on the static graph
   embedding. In the present work, an efficient dynamic graph embedding
   approach is proposed, called dynamic GCN (DyGCN), which is an extension
   of the GCN-based methods. The embedding propagation scheme of GCN is
   naturally generalized to a dynamic setting in an efficient manner, which
   propagates the change in topological structure and neighborhood
   embeddings along the graph to update the node embeddings. The most
   affected nodes are updated first, and then their changes are propagated
   to further nodes, which in turn are updated. Extensive experiments on
   various dynamic graphs showed that the proposed model can update the
   node embeddings in a time-saving and performance-preserving way.

AB Accurate and real-time traffic flow prediction is an essential component
   of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Balancing the prediction
   accuracy and time cost of prediction models is a challenging topic. This
   paper proposes a deep learning framework (FedAGCN) based on federated
   learning and asynchronous graph convolutional networks to predict
   traffic flow accurately in real time. FedAGCN applies asynchronous
   spatial-temporal graph convolution to model the spatial-temporal
   dependence in traffic data. In order to reduce the time cost of the deep
   learning model, we propose a graph federated learning strategy GraphFed
   to train the model. Experiments were conducted on two public traffic
   datasets, and the results showed that FedAGCN effectively reduced the
   training and inference time of the model while maintaining considerable
   prediction accuracy.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elliptic data-one of the largest Bitcoin transaction graphs-has admitted
   promising results in many studies using classical supervised learning
   and graph convolutional network models for anti-money laundering.
   Despite the promising results provided by these studies, only few have
   considered the temporal information of this dataset, wherein the results
   were not very satisfactory. Moreover, there is very sparse existing
   literature that applies active learning to this type of blockchain
   dataset. In this paper, we develop a classification model that combines
   long-short-term memory with GCN-referred to as temporal-GCN-that
   classifies the illicit transactions of Elliptic data using its
   transaction's features only. Subsequently, we present an active learning
   framework applied to the large-scale Bitcoin transaction graph dataset,
   unlike previous studies on this dataset. Uncertainties for active
   learning are obtained using Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) and
   Monte-Carlo based adversarial attack (MC-AA) which are Bayesian
   approximations. Active learning frameworks with these methods are
   compared using various acquisition functions that appeared in the
   literature. To the best of our knowledge, MC-AA method is the first time
   to be examined in the context of active learning. Our main finding is
   that temporal-GCN model has attained significant success in comparison
   to the previous studies with the same experimental settings on the same
   dataset. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the provided
   acquisition functions using MC-AA and MC-dropout and compare the result
   against the baseline random sampling model.

AB Background Selecting and prioritizing candidate disease genes is
   necessary before conducting laboratory studies as identifying disease
   genes from a large number of candidate genes using laboratory methods,
   is a very costly and time-consuming task. There are many machine
   learning-based gene prioritization methods. These methods differ in
   various aspects including the feature vectors of genes, the used
   datasets with different structures, and the learning model. Creating a
   suitable feature vector for genes and an appropriate learning model on a
   variety of data with different and non-Euclidean structures, including
   graphs, as well as the lack of negative data are very important
   challenges of these methods. The use of graph neural networks has
   recently emerged in machine learning and other related fields, and they
   have demonstrated superior performance for a broad range of problems.
   Methods In this study, a new semi-supervised learning method based on
   graph convolutional networks is presented using the novel constructing
   feature vector for each gene. In the proposed method, first, we
   construct three feature vectors for each gene using terms from the Gene
   Ontology (GO) database. Then, we train a graph convolution network on
   these vectors using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network data to
   identify disease candidate genes. Our model discovers hidden layer
   representations encoding in both local graph structure as well as
   features of nodes. This method is characterized by the simultaneous
   consideration of topological information of the biological network
   (e.g., PPI) and other sources of evidence. Finally, a validation has
   been done to demonstrate the efficiency of our method. Results Several
   experiments are performed on 16 diseases to evaluate the proposed
   method's performance. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed
   method achieves the best results, in terms of precision, the area under
   the ROC curve (AUCs), and F1-score values, when compared with eight
   state-of-the-art network and machine learning-based disease gene
   prioritization methods. Conclusion This study shows that the proposed
   semi-supervised learning method appropriately classifies and ranks
   candidate disease genes using a graph convolutional network and an
   innovative method to create three feature vectors for genes based on the
   molecular function, cellular component, and biological process terms
   from GO data.

AB As real-world data become increasingly heterogeneous, multi-view
   semi-supervised learning has garnered widespread attention. Although
   existing studies have made efforts towards this and achieved decent
   performance, they are restricted to shallow models and how to mine
   deeper information from multiple views remains to be investigated. As a
   recently emerged neural network, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
   exploits graph structure to propagate label signals and has achieved
   encouraging performance, and it has been widely employed in various
   fields. Nonetheless, research on solving multi-view learning problems
   via GCN is limited and lacks interpretability. To address this gap, in
   this paper we propose a framework termed Interpretable Multi-view Graph
   Convolutional Network (IMvGCN). We first combine the reconstruction
   error and Laplacian embedding to formulate a multi-view learning problem
   that explores the original space from feature and topology perspectives.
   In light of a series of derivations, we establish a potential connection
   between GCN and multi-view learning, which holds significance for both
   domains. Furthermore, we propose an orthogonal normalization method to
   guarantee the mathematical connection, which solves the intractable
   problem of orthogonal constraints in deep learning. In addition, the
   proposed framework is applied to the multi-view semi-supervised learning
   task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
   proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods.

AB To implicitly reflect the relationship between traits and emotional
   expressions in a context, prevalent ways to uncover emotional
   configurations mostly rely on attention processes. Aspect-level
   sentiment analysis (ABSA) seeks to identify the emotional patterns of
   certain qualities in phrases while omitting the grammatical information
   of the Web of Things. The model includes a graph convolutional neural
   network (GCN) based on a dependency syntax tree and exploits syntactic
   structural data to directly correlate traits with their related
   emotional expressions, hence reducing classification interference
   brought to by duplicated inputs. The pretrained model BERT also picks up
   more grammatical knowledge by being guided by intermediary layer
   representations of different types of grammatical information. Each GCN
   layer's input is merged with the preceding layer's output and the
   guiding information from the BERT intermediate layer. Finally, the
   feature for sentiment classification is the representation of
   characteristics in the final layer of GCN. The experimental results on
   the SemEval 2014, Task4, Restaurant, Laptop, and Twitter datasets show
   that the proposed model provides better performance of classification
   accuracy than a substantial number of benchmark models.

AB To activate dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, CH3SOCH3) as a methylation agent
   in the C-H functionalization of (iso)quinoliniums (1), a heterogeneous
   photo-Fenton-like method involving the in situ generation of hydroxyl
   radicals by a gCN/MnO/MnO(OH) photocatalyst under visible light
   irradiation was realized for the first time. In the developed
   methodology, only a small amount of gCN/MnO/MnO(OH) photocatalysts (15
   mg) was needed for the methylation of (iso)quinoliniums (1.0 mmol-scale
   of 1) to achieve moderate to good yields of the expected
   methylated-products (2) under ambient conditions. Mechanistically,
   hydroxyl radicals (OH) are produced when the gCN/MnO/MnO(OH)
   photocatalyst reacts with H2O and O-2 under visible light illumination,
   and then they are added to DMSO, where they subsequently fragment into
   CH3 radicals. The product is generated via the nucleophilic attack of
   the CH3 radical at the most electron-deficient position of 1, followed
   by deprotonation reaction. The same procedure could also be used to
   create trideuteromethylated (iso)quinolines (3) when DMSO-d(6)
   (CD3SOCD3) was used in place of DMSO. The presented novel strategy for
   DMSO or DMSO-d(6) activation herein is more practical, cost-effective,
   and risk-free compared to the conventional Fenton reagent (H2O2 and
   Fe2+/Fe3+) systems available in the literature. Additionally, the
   gCN/MnO/MnO(OH) photocatalyst is easy to prepare, practical and
   economical together with being easy recoverable and reusable for several
   runs without considerable loss in its initial activity.

   (GCN-GRU) dynamic anomaly detection method for gantry transactions. In
   this paper, four different classes of gantry anomalies are defined and
   modeled, representing gantries as nodes and the connectivity between
   gantries as edges. First, the spatial distribution of highway ETC
   gantries is modeled using the GCN model to extract gantry node features.
   Then, the contextual attention mechanism is utilized to capture the
   recent patterns of the dynamic transaction graph of the gantries, and
   the GRU model is used to extract the time-series characteristics of the
   gantry nodes to dynamically update the gantry leakage. Our model is
   evaluated on several experimental datasets and compared with other
   commonly used anomaly detection methods. The experimental results show
   that our model outperforms other anomaly detection models in terms of
   accuracy, precision, and other evaluation values of 99%, proving its
   effectiveness and robustness. This model has a wide application
   potential in real gantry detection and management.

AB Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition that can lead to
   significant harm, such as heart disease, kidney disease, nerve damage,
   and blindness. Although T2D-related genes have been identified through
   Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and various computational
   methods, the biological mechanism of T2D at the cell type level remains
   unclear. Exploring cell type-specific genes related to T2D is essential
   to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the disease. To address
   this issue, we introduce DiGCellNet (predicting Disease Genes with Cell
   type specificity based on biological Networks), a model that integrates
   graph convolutional network (GCN) and multi-task learning (MTL) to
   predict T2D-associated cell type-specific genes based on the biological
   network. Our work represents the first attempt to predict cell
   type-specific disease genes using GCN and MTL. We evaluate our approach
   by predicting genes specific to four cell types and demonstrate that the
   proposed DiGCellNet outperforms other models that combine node
   embeddings with traditional machine learning algorithms. Moreover,
   DiGCellNet successfully identifies CALM1 as a gene specific to beta cell
   type in T2D cases, and this association is confirmed using an
   independent dataset. The code is available at
   https://github.com/23AIBox/23AIBox-DiGCellNet.

AB Context-aware recommender systems (CARS), which capture user preferences
   by incorporating user interactions and side information, have attracted
   widespread attention in today's information age. With the emergence of
   graph convolution networks (GCN) in recent years, graph methods have
   been shown effective in establishing global connections between users,
   items, and contexts. In this paper, we first introduce a unified graph
   recommendation framework to incorporate both GCN and traditional models,
   showing the similarities and differences between them in terms of
   parameter configurations and message passing styles. Then, based on the
   empirical analysis of existing models, we propose a novel Fused Graph
   Context-aware Recommender system (FGCR) model to address the identified
   limitations. FGCR fuses the parameter configuration of both item-based
   models and GCN, modeling robust node relationships in user-item-context
   interaction graph through a sparse item correlation matrix and dense
   node embeddings. In addition, FGCR applies a novel masked graph
   convolution strategy to refine the information aggregation process with
   various types of nodes. Experiments conducted on five realworld datasets
   show that FGCR significantly improves performance compared to the seven
   baseline models. Ablation study and user group analysis validate the
   effectiveness of each component in FGCR, especially in modeling active
   users and sparse contextual information.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Accurate prediction of wind power generation is of great significance
   for the efficient operation of wind farms. However, traditional deep
   learning-based methods predict the wind power without simultaneously
   considering the temporal features of wind power and spatial features
   between variables, which leads to low prediction accuracy. This article
   proposes a novel wind power forecasting approach based on a graph
   convolution network (GCN) and a multiresolution convolution neural
   network (CNN), combining spatial features and temporal features. In this
   approach, GCN merged with maximum information coefficient (MIC) is
   proposed to extract the spatial correlation features between input
   variables, which considers the effects of multiple variables on wind
   power and provides interpretability for deep learning-based forecasting.
   On the other hand, multiresolution CNN combines multiscale convolution
   kernels with a new self-attention mechanism to understand local and
   long-term temporal features, which enables simultaneous prediction of
   wind power and other variables. Experiments on a real dataset prove that
   the proposed method is effective and accurate in short-term wind power
   forecasting. Comparisons with the other three state-of-the-art methods
   and ablation experiments also reveal the advantages of the proposed
   approach.

AB A solid state microwave (MW) assisted hydrothermal method was used to
   prepare S-scheme heterojunction composite Bi2S3@doped gCN (BS@CN). TC
   was degraded upto 99.9 % under 20 min visible light, with synergistic
   action of 0.2 g/L catalyst having 10 wt% Bi2S3 (BS(10)@CN) and 1.5 g/L
   PMS, for initial TC concentration of 50 mg/L, exhibiting first order
   rate constant (kapp): 0.215 min 1. The modulation of band-structure due
   to the generation of heterojunction, coupled with different
   surface-bound redox cycles, i. e.,Co2 + /Co3 +|(surf),Ce-3 + /Ce-4
   +|(surf). andBi(3) + /Bi-4 +... surf., helped the charge migration,
   separation of excited e-/h+ and production of reactive species, like,SO4
   center dot- , (OH)-O-center dot,O-2(center dot),O-2(1), etc., that
   played important roles towards TC degradation. Band-structure
   determination, XPS analysis and other characterizations revealed the
   formation of Sscheme configuration and corresponding surface-bound
   metastable complexes towards self-regeneration and excellent catalytic
   activity of the composite, even in the contaminated real-life surface
   water sources. Extensive intermediate analysis was carried out to
   develop a detailed TC degradation pathway. The BS@CN photocatalyst can
   be recycled multiple times, without significant loss of photocatalytic
   activity (similar to 88 % TC degradation after 5 cycles). This study
   demonstrated the design and fabrication of metal oxide doped gCN/metal
   chalcogenide-based heterojunction photocatalysts that have potential
   applications towards the removal of refractory contaminants in aqueous
   medium.

AB Connexin family proteins assemble into hexameric hemichannels in the
   cell membrane. The hemichannels dock together between two adjacent
   membranes to form gap junction intercellular channels (GJIChs). We
   report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Cx43 GJICh, revealing
   the dynamic equilibrium state of various channel conformations in
   detergents and lipid nanodiscs. We identify three different N-terminal
   helix conformations of Cx43-gate-covering (GCN), pore-lining (PLN), and
   flexible intermediate (FIN)-that are randomly distributed in purified
   GJICh particles. The conformational equilibrium shifts to GCN by
   cholesteryl hemisuccinates and to PLN by C-terminal truncations and at
   varying pH. While GJIChs that mainly comprise GCN protomers are occluded
   by lipids, those containing conformationally heterogeneous protomers
   show markedly different pore sizes. We observe an alpha-to-pi-helix
   transition in the first transmembrane helix, which creates a side
   opening to the membrane in the FIN and PLN conformations. This study
   provides basic structural information to understand the mechanisms of
   action and regulation of Cx43 GJICh.
   Gap junction intercellular channels (GJIChs) facilitate direct
   communication between adjacent cells. Here, authors provide
   high-resolution information on dynamic structural changes in Cx43 GJICh
   that are necessary to understand the gating mechanism.

AB We study and address the multi-view crowd counting (MVCC) problem which
   poses more realistic challenges than single-view crowd counting for
   better facilitating crowd management/public safety systems. Its major
   challenge lies in how to fully distill and aggregate useful,
   complementary information among multiple camera views to create powerful
   ground-plane representations for wide-area crowd analysis. In this
   paper, we present a graph-based, multi-view learning model called
   Co-Communication Graph Convolutional Network (CoCo-GCN) to jointly
   investigate intra-view contextual dependencies and inter-view
   complementary relations. More specifically, CoCo-GCN builds a
   view-agnostic graph interaction space for each camera view to conduct
   efficient contextual reasoning, and extends the intra-view reasoning by
   using a novel Graph Communication Layer (GCL) to also take between-graph
   (cross-view), complementary information into account. Moreover, CoCo-GCN
   uses a new Co-Memory Layer (CoML) to jointly coarsen the graphs and
   close the 'representational gap' among them for further exploiting the
   compositional nature of graphs and learning more consistent
   representations. Finally, these jointly learned features of multiple
   views can be easily fused to create ground-plane representations for
   wide-area crowd counting. Experiments show that the proposed CoCo-GCN
   achieves state-of-the-art results on three MVCC datasets, i.e.,
   PETS2009, DukeMTMC, and City Street, significantly improving the
   scene-level accuracy over previous models.

AB Unsupervised person re-identification (RE-ID) has attracted increasing
   attention recently due to its low costs and high application values.
   Currently, most of the unsupervised RE-ID approaches attempt to explore
   discriminative visual features based on unlabeled samples, which suffer
   from the label noise problem. To alleviate this problem, this paper
   first proposes to leverage both visual and spatial information for
   unsupervised person RE-ID, with a feasible assumption that the same
   identity has similar neighbors across different cameras. Technically, we
   devise an iterative Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to alternately
   improve the quality of pseudo-labels and multimodal fusion features.
   What is more, our modal is trained based on three novel pseudo-label
   classes (pseudo-positive, visually similar, and pseudo-negative) instead
   of two to better learn discriminative features. Extensive experiments on
   two representative datasets (Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID) demonstrate
   the effectiveness of our approach, with 1%-2% mAP improvements as
   compared to the advanced approaches.

AB The abuse of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) has caused serious
   environmental pollution problems in recent years due to excessive use of
   biomedicine, healthcare, animal husbandry and other fields. How to
   effectively remove TCs contaminants from water has been one of research
   emphasis on environment protection. In this work, we have successfully
   prepared a composite photocatalyst (P16-ZrO2/gCN) by physical mixing
   method and H2 plasma treatment at room temperature. The ZrO2
   nanoparticles and H2 plasma treatment have synergetic effects on
   photocatalytic performance of gCN for degradation of TCs, and the
   highest degradation rate is achieved with 16 mins plasma treatment.
   According to BET, XPS and EPR results, more mesopores and nitrogen
   vacancies (NVs) are introduced by H2 plasma treatment. Furthermore,
   In-situ TRPL spectra illustrate that ZrO2 nanoparticles and H2 plasma
   treatment facilitate charge transfer process of catalysts. Overall, this
   work firstly reports utilizing ZrO2 nanoparticles/H2 plasma treatment
   together to boost photocatalytic performance of gCN and provides a
   low-cost approach for preparation of other photocatalysts.

   Province from March 23 to March 29, 2020, according to the transmission
   characteristics of COVID-19. On the one hand, Spearman correlation
   analysis with delay days and LsOA are used to capture the dynamic
   changes of feature information to obtain the temporal features. On the
   other hand, the graph convolutional network is used to capture the
   topological structure of the city network, so as to obtain spatial
   information and finally realize the prediction task. Then, we evaluate
   this model through performance evaluation indicators and statistical
   test methods and compare the results of LsOA-GCN with 10 representative
   prediction methods in the current epidemic prediction study. The
   experimental results show that the LsOA-GCN prediction model is
   significantly better than other prediction methods in all indicators and
   can successfully capture spatio-temporal information from feature data,
   thereby achieving accurate prediction of epidemic trends in different
   regions of Hubei Province.

AB The accurate classification of forest types is critical for sustainable
   forest management. In this study, a novel multiscale global graph
   convolutional neural network (MSG-GCN) was compared with random forest
   (RF), U-Net, and U-Net++ models in terms of the classification of
   natural mixed forest (NMX), natural broadleaved forest (NBL), and
   conifer plantation (CP) using very high-resolution aerial photographs
   from the University of Tokyo Chiba Forest in central Japan. Our MSG-GCN
   architecture is novel in the following respects: The convolutional
   kernel scale of the encoder is unlike those of other models; local
   attention replaces the conventional U-Net++ skip connection; a
   multiscale graph convolutional neural block is embedded into the end
   layer of the encoder module; and various decoding layers are spliced to
   preserve high- and low-level feature information and to improve the
   decision capacity for boundary cells. The MSG-GCN achieved higher
   classification accuracy than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The
   classification accuracy in terms of NMX was lower compared with NBL and
   CP. The RF method produced severe salt-and-pepper noise. The U-Net and
   U-Net++ methods frequently produced error patches and the edges between
   different forest types were rough and blurred. In contrast, the MSG-GCN
   method had fewer misclassification patches and showed clear edges
   between different forest types. Most areas misclassified by MSG-GCN were
   on edges, while misclassification patches were randomly distributed in
   internal areas for U-Net and U-Net++. We made full use of artificial
   intelligence and very high-resolution remote sensing data to create
   accurate maps to aid forest management and facilitate efficient and
   accurate forest resource inventory taking in Japan.

AB Regarding the classification of 3D point clouds, existing Graph
   Convolution Networks (GCN) often fail to effectively learn the

   visual selective attention with the graph convolution calculation method
   and inherits the advantages of the idea of rasterization. In the paper,
   the deep learning technology, the idea of multi-view, and the VAGCN were
   combined to establish three GCN models which were then applied to the
   classification of 3D point clouds and attained good results. Then the
   parameters set for the proposed algorithm were verified based on the

AB Purpose: Accurate diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) plays a
   key role in improving the condition and quality of life for patients. In
   this study, we mainly focus on ASD diagnosis with functional brain
   networks (FBNs). The major challenge for brain networks modeling is the
   high dimensional connectivity in brain networks and limited number of
   subjects, which hinders the classification capability of graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs). Method: To alleviate the influence of the
   limited data and high dimensional connectivity, we introduce a unified
   three-stage graph learning framework for brain network classification,
   involving multi-graph clustering, graph generation and graph
   classification. The framework combining Graph Generation, Clustering and
   Classification Networks (GraphCGC-Net) enhances the critical connections
   by multi-graph clustering (MGC) with a supervision scheme, and generates
   realistic brain networks by simultaneously preserving the global
   consistent distribution and local topology properties. Results: To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method on the Autism Brain Imaging Data
   Exchange (ABIDE) dataset and conduct extensive experiments on the ASD
   classification problem. Our proposed method achieves an average accuracy
   of 70.45% and an AUC of 72.76% on ABIDE. Compared with the traditional
   GCN model, the proposed GraphCGC-Net obtains 9.3%, and 10.64%
   improvement in terms of accuracy and AUC metrics, respectively.
   Conclusion: The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our
   GraphCGC-Net is effective for graph classification in brain disorders
   diagnosis. Moreover, we find that MGC can generate biologically
   meaningful subnetworks, which is highly consistent with the previous
   neuroimaging-derived biomarker evidence of ASD. More importantly, the
   promising results suggest that applying generative adversarial networks
   (GANs) in brain networks to improve the classification performance is
   worth further investigation.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Phthalate esters (PAEs) widely used as plasticizers in industrial
   products are a major threat to human health and water ecological
   security. In this work, chitin-based sponges doped with oxygen-modified
   graphitic carbon nitride (O-gCN) (ChCN) demonstrated
   adsorption-photocatalytic synergistic ability for the efficient removal
   of two typical PAEs, diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate
   (DBP). The addition of O-gCN increased the sponge mechanical strength
   from 0.629 to 1.39 MPa, enabling materials with interconnected pores,
   excellent compressibility, and mechanical durability. The saturated
   adsorption capacities of DEP and DBP reached 37.41-42.93 mg g-1 for ChCN
   sponges, wherein the driving forces were hydrophobic interactions,
   hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi interactions. Notably, O-gCN significantly
   improved PAE removal by simultaneously enhancing the adsorption and
   photocatalytic effect of ChCN sponges due to its high catalytic
   activity, leading to 100% removal of DEP and DBP within 2 h. The
   degradation pathway of DEP was confirmed to be de-esterification.
   Finally, filtration columns assembled with ChCN sponges showed
   87.8-90.9% PAE removal from water under natural light, and the removal
   efficiency did not significantly change even after three reuses,
   indicating stable removal performance and good reusability with
   potential for practical applications. The sponges also possessed good
   biocompatibility and biodegradability, as demonstrated through algal
   toxicity experiments and biodegra-dation tests. Therefore, this research
   presents a convenient method for preparation of compressible and
   reusable sponge materials from renewable biomass for efficient PAE
   removal from aqueous environments and has revealed the underlying
   mechanisms of such removal by the adsorption-photocatalysis synergistic
   effect.

AB Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has gained increasing
   research attention in recent years due to its wide applications in a
   surge of emerging tasks, such as social media analysis, dialog
   generation, and recommender systems. Since constituent utterances in a
   conversation are closely semantic-related, the constituent utterances'
   emotional states are also closely related. In our consideration, this
   correlation could serve as a guide for the emotion recognition of
   constituent utterances. Accordingly, we propose a novel approach named
   Semantic-correlation Graph Convolutional Network (SC-GCN) to take
   advantage of this correlation for the ERC task in multimodal scenario.
   Specifically, we first introduce a hierarchical fusion module to model
   the dynamics among the textual, acoustic and visual features and fuse
   the multimodal information. Afterward, we construct a graph structure
   based on the speaker and temporal dependency of the dialog. We put
   forward a novel multi-loop architecture to explore the semantic
   correlations by the self-attention mechanism and enhance the correlation
   information via multiple loops. Through the graph convolution process,
   the proposed SC-GCN finally obtains a refined representation of each
   utterance, which is used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments
   are conducted on two benchmark datasets and the experimental results
   demonstrate the superiority of our SC-GCN.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment
   polarity of a specified aspect in a sentence. Graph neural networks
   (GNN) based on dependency trees have been shown to be effective for ABSA
   by explicitly modeling the connection between aspect and opinion terms
   and exploiting local semantic and syntactic information in the sentence.
   However, most previous works have overlooked the use of global
   dependency information. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph
   Convolutional Network (GCN) with an Interactive Memory Fusion (IMF)
   mechanism (IMF-GCN) that incorporates both global and local structural
   information for aspect-based sentiment classification. The IMF mechanism
   efficiently fuses global and local structural dependency information by
   assigning different weights to global and local dependency modules.
   Syntactic constraints are also imposed to prevent the graph convolution
   propagation unrelated to the target words, further improving the model's
   performance. The evaluation metrics used in the paper are accuracy and
   macro-average F1 scores, and the proposed approach achieves optimal
   results on three datasets with F1 scores of 79.60%, 82.19%, and 77.75%,
   which outperform the baseline model.

AB This paper introduces a novel surrogate model for two-dimensional
   adaptive steady-state thermal convection fields based on deep learning
   technology. The proposed model aims to overcome limitations in
   traditional frameworks caused by network types, such as the requirement
   for extensive training data, accuracy loss due to pixelated
   preprocessing of original data, and inability to predict information
   near the boundaries with precision. We propose a new framework that
   consists primarily of a physical-informed neural network (PINN) and a
   graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The GCN serves as the
   prediction module and predicts thermal convection in the two-dimensional
   computational domain by considering the mutual influence between
   unstructured nodes and their neighbors. On the other hand, the PINN acts
   as the physical constraint module of the framework by embedding the
   control equation of thermal convection into the loss function of the
   neural network, ensuring that the inference and prediction results of
   the GCN comply with the constraints of the control equation. The
   advantages of this framework lie in two aspects. First, the computation
   mechanism of the GCN is more in line with the actual evolution of
   temperature fields. Second, the PINN enhances the cognitive ability of
   the surrogate model toward the convection field information. It
   accurately describes the changes of temperature gradient information at
   the boundary position and reduces the model's demand for training data.
   To validate the advantages of the proposed model, we gradually analyzed
   the model's geometric adaptability and predictive accuracy from the
   single cylinder case to the double cylinder case. We also investigated
   the impact of the number of sampling points on model training and
   compared the model's prediction results with those of a purely
   data-driven model. The results show that the proposed model exhibits
   good geometric adaptability and stability. With only 20 training data,
   the mean error of the proposed model in predicting the velocity and
   temperature field is less than 1% and 0.6% for the single cylinder, and
   less than 2% and 1% for the double cylinder case, while the mean error
   of the purely data-driven GCN model in predicting the velocity and
   temperature field is 9.4% and 6.4% for the double cylinder case. These
   findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed
   graph convolutional neural network, allowing for more accurate
   prediction of fluid flow and heat convection using surrogate model.

AB In this study, we utilized calcination and simple impregnation methods
   to successfully fabricate bare g-C3N4 (GCN) and x% Ag/g-C3N4 (x% AgGCN)
   composite photocatalysts with various weight percentages (x = 1, 3, 5,
   and 7 wt.%). The synthesized bare and composite photocatalysts were
   analyzed to illustrate their phase formation, functional group,
   morphology, and optical properties utilizing XRD, FT-IR, UV-Vis DRS, PL,
   FE-SEM, and the EDS. The photodegradation rate of MO under solar light
   irradiation was measured, and the 5% AgGCN composite photocatalyst
   showed higher photocatalytic activity (99%), which is very high compared
   to other bare and composite photocatalysts. The MO dye degradation rate
   constant with the 5% AgGCN photocatalyst exhibits 14.83 times better
   photocatalytic activity compared to the bare GCN catalyst. This
   photocatalyst showed good efficiency in the degradation of MO dye and
   demonstrated cycling stability even in the 5th successive photocatalytic
   reaction cycle. The higher photocatalytic activity of the 5% AgGCN
   composite catalyst for the degradation of MO dye is due to the
   interaction of Ag with GCN and the localized surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) effect of Ag. The scavenger study results indicate that O-2(?-)
   radicals play a major role in MO dye degradation. A possible
   charge-transfer mechanism is proposed to explain the solar-light-driven
   photocatalyst of GCN.

AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of arrhythmia with a high
   incidence and risk, and it is difficult to monitor. Deep learning-based
   algorithms for AF detection have made preliminary progress, with
   Recurrent Convolution Neural Networks (RCNN) being widely used for AF
   detection. The RCNN algorithm combines electrocardiogram (ECG)
   morphology and rhythm information, where Convolution Neural Network
   (CNN) mainly processes morphological features and Recurrent Neural
   Network (RNN) mainly deals with rhythm information. However, a problem
   with this method is that direct splicing and fusion of ECG rhythm
   features and ECG morphological features cannot fully exploit the
   information of both features for AF detection because they have
   different representative spaces. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel
   AF detection algorithm based on graph convolution network, named AF-GCN.
   First, we transform heartbeats into a graph structure, called heartbeat
   diagrams. The node features of the heartbeat graph are the morphological
   information of each heartbeat, and the edge of the heartbeat is linked
   according to the time interval between heartbeats. Moreover, we
   calculate the edge weight according to the morphological similarity
   between heartbeats. Therefore, the morphological information and rhythm
   information of the ECG signal can be unifiedly expressed in one
   heartbeat. Then, using the Graph Convolution Network (GCN), the
   morphological and rhythmic features of the ECG signal can be effectively
   extracted, modeled, and fused in one network modal. We evaluated our
   AF-GCN method on two popular and widely recognized AF detection
   benchmarks, MIT-BIH AFDB and Physionet Challenge 2017 AFDB datasets. The
   results show that AF-GCN outperforms other existing methods.

AB Recommending Smart Social Network (SSN) items which are in line with
   user preferences is one of the significant applications in SSNs such as
   Event-Based Social Networks (EBSNs) and Smart object Based Social
   Network (SBSN). It is well acknowledged that geographical and social
   contextual influences play an important role in SSN item Recommender
   System (RS). Whereas incorporating such contextual influences into SSN
   item RSs is a challenging issue which needs to be addressed along with
   the conventional RS challenges (cold-start problem and data sparsity).
   To this end, a novel SSN item recommendation architecture (named as
   3T-IEC*) based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed.
   Specifically, 3T-IEC* constructs an SSN item location graph based on
   physical distance between two SSN items and leverages a GCN-based
   representation learning method to capture geographical influence of SSN
   items; which not only incorporates the geographical preferences but also
   delivers a convincing idea to solve the data sparsity problem.
   Sequentially, 3T-IEC* deploys one more GCN to incorporate users' social
   associations. Furthermore, 3T-IEC* leverages self-attention technique
   with multiple heads to incorporate user's preferences over SSN items'
   multiple features. The experimental results on four real life datasets
   demonstrate superior performance of 3T-IEC* compared with
   state-of-the-art methods such as SkyLine (149%), 3T-IEC (54%), DeepWalk
   (38%), SORec (9%), and NGCF (7%).

AB In this study, a magnetic perovskite nanohybrid based on g-C3N4 (gCN)
   nanosheets was synthesized and developed for the efficient
   photodegradation of toxic environmental pollutants under short-time
   visible irradiation. The synthesis of this nanohybrid involved the
   incorporation of SrTiO3:N (STO:N) and ZnFe2O4 (ZnF) onto the g-C3N4
   nanosheets through a simple reflux method. Our investigation encompassed
   a comprehensive suite of analytical techniques, including BET, TGA, TEM,
   SEM, EDX, DRS, VSM, XRD, photocurrent, and FT-IR, to elucidate the
   physicochemical characteristics of this nanocomposite in the context of
   its application in photodegradation processes. The nanohybrid displayed
   significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to its
   individual components, achieving a degradation efficiency of over 90%
   for various pollutants, including organic dyes like Rhodamine B (Rh-B),
   within a short irradiation time. This enhanced activity can be
   attributed to the synergistic effect between gCN, STO:N, and ZnF, which
   promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species and facilitates the
   degradation process. Notably, the nanocomposite containing 20 wt% STO:N
   perovskite and 20 wt% ZnF demonstrated the highest Rh-B degradation rate
   under visible light irradiation within just 30 min. Furthermore, the
   nanohybrid displayed excellent stability and reusability over seven
   consecutive runs, retaining its high photocatalytic activity even after
   multiple cycles of degradation. This remarkable performance can be
   attributed to the strong interaction between the gCN nanosheets and the
   magnetic perovskite components, which prevents their aggregation and
   ensures their efficient utilization. Additionally, the nanohybrid
   exhibited excellent visible light absorption, enabling the utilization
   of a wider range of light for degradation. This feature is particularly
   advantageous, as visible light is more abundant in sunlight compared to
   UV light, rendering the nanohybrid suitable for practical applications
   under natural sunlight. In conclusion, the ternary gCN-STO:N@ZnF
   nanocomposite represents a promising candidate for the treatment of
   organic pollutants in aqueous environments, offering a versatile and
   efficient solution.

AB BACKGROUND: Accurate and timely assessment of children's developmental
   status is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. More accurate
   and automated developmental assessments are essential due to the lack of
   trained health care providers and imprecise parental reporting. In
   various areas of development, gross motor development in toddlers is
   known to be predictive of subsequent childhood developments.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a model to assess
   gross motor behavior and integrate the results to determine the overall
   gross motor status of toddlers. This study also aimed to identify
   behaviors that are important in the assessment of overall gross motor
   skills and detect critical moments and important body parts for the
   assessment of each behavior.
   METHODS: We used behavioral videos of toddlers aged 18-35 months. To
   assess gross motor development, we selected 4 behaviors (climb up the
   stairs, go down the stairs, throw the ball, and stand on 1 foot) that
   have been validated with the Korean Developmental Screening Test for
   Infants and Children. In the child behavior videos, we estimated each
   child's position as a bounding box and extracted human keypoints within
   the box. In the first stage, the videos with the extracted human
   keypoints of each behavior were evaluated separately using a graph
   convolutional networks (GCN)-based algorithm. The probability values
   obtained for each label in the first-stage model were used as input for
   the second-stage model, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
   algorithm, to predict the overall gross motor status. For
   interpretability, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping
   (Grad-CAM) to identify important moments and relevant body parts during
   the movements. The Shapley additive explanations method was used for the
   assessment of variable importance, to determine the movements that
   contributed the most to the overall developmental assessment.
   RESULTS: Behavioral videos of 4 gross motor skills were collected from
   147 children, resulting in a total of 2395 videos. The stage-1 GCN model
   to evaluate each behavior had an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.79 to 0.90. Keypoint-mapping Grad-CAM
   visualization identified important moments in each behavior and
   differences in important body parts. The stage-2 XGBoost model to assess
   the overall gross motor status had an AUROC of 0.90. Among the 4
   behaviors, "go down the stairs" contributed the most to the overall
   developmental assessment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using movement videos of toddlers aged 18-35 months, we
   developed objective and automated models to evaluate each behavior and
   assess each child's overall gross motor performance. We identified the
   important behaviors for assessing gross motor performance and developed
   methods to recognize important moments and body parts while evaluating
   gross motor performance.

AB N2 electrochemical reduction (NRR) suffers from weak activity and fierce
   competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose a
   strengthened activating strategy for N2 fixation via hydrogen bonds. To
   this end, amino functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (NHx-gCN) is
   designed. Through the N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISN hydrogen bonds
   between amino groups and N2 as well as NRR intermediates of NxHy,
   NHx-gCN presents dramatically enhanced NRR performance, with NH3 yield
   rate of 56.38 mu g mg-cat 1h-1 and Faradaic efficiency of 27.00 %
   at-0.73 V (vs RHE). Theoretical calculations certify through hydrogen
   bonds the adsorption of N2 and NxHy on NHx-gCN is enhanced and the
   dissociation of N2 into *N2H and *N2H2 is greatly facilitated. Besides,
   hydrogen bonding interactions between amino groups and heptazine can
   suppress the HER by inhibiting adsorption of proton H. This work
   delivers a new hydrogen-bond strategy to optimal NRR performance with
   both high NH3 production and high Faradaic efficiency.

AB A graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed in the deep energy
   method (DEM) model to solve the momentum balance equation in
   three-dimensional space for the deformation of linear elastic and
   hyperelastic materials due to its ability to handle irregular domains
   over the traditional DEM method based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
   network. The method's accuracy and solution time are compared to the DEM
   model based on a MLP network. We demonstrate that the GCN-based model
   delivers similar accuracy while having a shorter run time through
   numerical examples. Two different spatial gradient computation
   techniques, one based on automatic differentiation (AD) and the other
   based on shape function (SF) gradients, are also accessed. We provide a
   simple example to demonstrate the strain localization instability
   associated with the AD-based gradient computation and show that the
   instability exists in more general cases by four numerical examples. The
   SF-based gradient computation is shown to be more robust and delivers an
   accurate solution even at severe deformations. Therefore, the
   combination of the GCN-based DEM model and SF-based gradient computation
   is potentially a promising candidate for solving problems involving
   severe material and geometric nonlinearities.

AB Sodium hypophosphite is a potential green source for the generation of
   clean elemental hydrogen without pollutants. The examination of the
   catalytic activity toward hydrogen production of different metallic
   nanoparticles supported on graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) was performed
   using sodium hypophosphite as hydrogen source. Four different metallic
   nanoparticles were assessed, namely, palladium, nickel, ruthenium, and
   rhodium. The Pd -based catalyst, Pd/GCN, was found to be the most active
   and stable of the four catalysts. The latter showed phenomenal catalytic
   activity of 100% conversion over five cycles hence makes this process
   sustainable. All four catalysts were characterized by PXRD, FTIR, XPS,
   TGA, TEM, and ICP-MS techniques. The blend of hypophosphite and Pd/GCN
   catalyst was weighed against the grouping of this catalyst with the
   traditional hydrogen source, po-tassium formate. We realized that the
   first combination is much more efficient and does not release
   byproducts, which makes this hydrogen source greener and more
   effectual.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by

AB In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the
   application of graph neural networks on a wide range of different
   problems. A specially promising direction of research is on graph
   convolutional neural networks (GCN). This work focuses on the
   application of GCNs to graph combinatorial optimization problems
   (GCOPs), specifically on their decision versions. GCNs are applied on
   the family of GCOPs in which the objective function is directly related
   to the number of vertices in a graph. The selected problems are the
   minimum vertex cover, maximum clique, minimum dominating set and graph
   coloring. In this work, a framework is proposed for solving problems of
   this type. The performance of this approach is explored for standard
   multi-layer GCNs using different types of convolutional layers. On top
   of this, we propose a new structure that is based on graph isomorphism
   networks. Computational experiments show that this new structure is
   significantly more efficient than basic structures. To further improve
   the performance of this method, the use of GCN ensembles is also
   explored. When using GCNs to generate solution values for GCOPs, they
   often correspond to non-feasible solutions because they violate the
   problem boundaries. This issue is addressed by defining an asymmetric
   loss function that is used during the GCN training. The proposed method
   is evaluated on a large set of training data consisting of graph
   solution pairs that can also be accessed online.

AB Recently, a large number of studies have indicated that circRNAs with
   covalently closed loops play important roles in biological processes and
   have potential as diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, research on the
   circRNAdisease relationship is helpful in disease diagnosis and
   treatment. However, traditional biological verification methods require
   considerable labor and time costs. In this paper, we propose a new
   computational method (RGCNCDA) to predict circRNA-disease associations
   based on relational graph convolutional networks (R-GCNs). The method
   first integrates the circRNA similarity network, miRNA similarity
   network, disease similarity network and association networks among them
   to construct a global heterogeneous network. Then, it employs the random
   walk with restart (RWR) and principal component analysis (PCA) models to
   learn low-dimensional and high-order information from the global
   heterogeneous network as the topological features. Finally, a prediction
   model based on an R-GCN encoder and a DistMult decoder is built to
   predict the potential diseaseassociated circRNA. The predicted results
   demonstrate that RGCNCDA performs significantly better than the other
   six state-of-the-art methods in a 5-fold cross validation. Furthermore,
   the case study illustrates that RGCNCDA can effectively discover
   potential circRNA-disease associations.

AB The sharp increase in encrypted traffic brings a huge challenge to
   traditional traffic classification methods. Combining deep learning with
   time series analysis techniques is a recent trend in solving this
   problem. Most of these approaches only capture the temporal correlation
   within a flow. The accuracy and robustness are unsatisfactory,
   especially in an unstable network environment with high packet loss and
   reordering. How to learn a representation with a strong generalization
   ability for each encrypted traffic flow remains a key challenge. Our
   detailed analysis indicates that there is a graph with particular local
   structures corresponding to each type of encrypted traffic flow.
   Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel deep learning framework
   called EC-GCN to classify encrypted traffic flows based on multi-scale
   graph convolutional neural networks. We first provide a novel
   lightweight layer that only relies on the metadata and encodes each
   encrypted traffic flow into graph representations. So that our framework
   can be independent of different encryption protocols. Then we design a
   novel graph pooling and structure learning layer to dynamically extract
   the multi-graph representations and improve the capabilities to adapt to
   complex network environments. EC-GCN is an end-to-end classification
   model that learns representative spatial-temporal traffic features
   hidden in a traffic time series and then classifies them in a unified
   framework. Our comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets
   indicate that EC-GCN can achieve up to 5%-20% accuracy improvement and
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB Accurate pavement crack detection is important for routine maintenance
   of pavements and reduction of possible traffic accidents. Most existing
   rule-or learning-based point-level approaches cannot achieve high
   detection accuracy and efficiency owing to the disorderly arrangement,
   scattered intensities, diverse crack structures, large data volumes, and
   complex annotation of mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. To
   address these issues, we developed SCL-GCN, a Stratified Contrastive
   Learning Graph Convolution Network with a novel dual-branch architecture
   for MLS-point cloud-based pavement crack detection. First, a multi-scale
   graph representation construction module was designed based on a
   stratification strategy. This module creates strengthened spaces for the
   raw pavement point cloud and its downsampled subset, from which
   adjacency matrices and initial representations are generated. The
   stratification strategy samples neighbors densely in the raw point
   clouds and sparsely in the downsampled subset to form the neighborhood
   for each point, utilizing long-range contexts to increase the effective
   receptive field while lowing the extra computation. Next, a graph
   feature contrastive learning module is proposed to take advantage of
   stratified features. This module supervises the learning process of the
   two branches to avoid learning bias caused by an imbalanced data
   distribution, promoting convergence and improving performance. The
   experimental results show that the developed SCL-GCN model outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods. With a training/testing ratio of only 1:6 and
   an overall training time of less than 70 min, the average precision,
   recall, and F1-score of the SCL-GCN reached 75.7%, 75.1%, and 75.2%,
   respectively.

AB The goal of zero-shot learning (ZSL) is to build a classifier that
   recognizes novel categories with no corresponding annotated training
   data. The typical routine is to transfer knowledge from seen classes to
   unseen ones by learning a visual-semantic embedding. Existing
   multi-label zero-shot learning approaches either ignore correlations
   among labels, suffer from large label combinations, or learn the
   embedding using only local or global visual features. In this paper, we
   propose a Graph Convolution Networks based Multi-label Zero-Shot
   Learning model, abbreviated as MZSL-GCN. Our model first constructs a
   label relation graph using label co-occurrences and compensates the
   absence of unseen labels in the training phase by semantic similarity.
   It then takes the graph and the word embedding of each seen (unseen)
   label as inputs to the GCN to learn the label semantic embedding, and to
   obtain a set of inter-dependent object classifiers. MZSL-GCN
   simultaneously trains another attention network to learn compatible
   local and global visual features of objects with respect to the
   classifiers, and thus makes the whole network end-to-end trainable. In
   addition, the use of unlabeled training data can reduce the bias toward
   seen labels and boost the generalization ability. Experimental results
   on benchmark datasets show that our MZSL-GCN competes with
   state-of-the-art approaches. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Group activity recognition is a central theme in many domains, such as
   sports video analysis, CCTV surveillance, sports tactics, and social
   scenario understanding. However, there are still challenges in embedding
   actors' relations in a multi-person scenario due to occlusion, movement,
   and light. Current studies mainly focus on collective and individual
   local features from the spatial and temporal perspectives, which results
   in inefficiency, low robustness, and low portability. To this end, a
   Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Graph Convolution Network (STAB-GCN)
   model is proposed to effectively embed deep complex relations between
   actors. Specifically, we leverage the attention mechanism to attentively
   explore spatio-temporal latent relations between actors. This approach
   captures spatio-temporal contextual information and improves individual
   and group embedding. Then, we feed actor relation graphs built from
   group activity videos into our proposed STAB-GCN for further inference,
   which selectively attends to the relevant features while ignoring those
   irrelevant to the relation extraction task. We perform experiments on
   three available group activity datasets, acquiring better performance
   than state-of-the-art methods. The results verify the validity of our
   proposed model and highlight the obstructive impacts of spatio-temporal
   attention-based graph embedding on group activity recognition.

AB Background: Drug response prediction is an important problem in
   computational personalized medicine. Many machine-learning-based
   methods, especially deep learning-based ones, have been proposed for
   this task. However, these methods often represent the drugs as strings,
   which are not a natural way to depict molecules. Also, interpretation
   (e.g., what are the mutation or copy number aberration contributing to
   the drug response) has not been considered thoroughly. Methods: In this
   study, we propose a novel method, GraphDRP, based on graph convolutional
   network for the problem. In GraphDRP, drugs were represented in
   molecular graphs directly capturing the bonds among atoms, meanwhile
   cell lines were depicted as binary vectors of genomic aberrations.
   Representative features of drugs and cell lines were learned by
   convolution layers, then combined to represent for each drug-cell line
   pair. Finally, the response value of each drug-cell line pair was
   predicted by a fully-connected neural network. Four variants of graph
   convolutional networks were used for learning the features of drugs.
   Results: We found that GraphDRP outperforms tCNNS in all performance
   measures for all experiments. Also, through saliency maps of the
   resulting GraphDRP models, we discovered the contribution of the genomic
   aberrations to the responses. Conclusion: Representing drugs as graphs
   can improve the performance of drug response prediction. Availability of

AB Motivation Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies have
   enabled gene expression profiles while preserving spatial context.
   Accurately identifying spatial domains is crucial for downstream
   analysis and it requires the effective integration of gene expression
   profiles and spatial information. While increasingly computational
   methods have been developed for spatial domain detection, most of them
   cannot adaptively learn the complex relationship between gene expression
   and spatial information, leading to sub-optimal performance. Results To
   overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning method named
   Spatial-MGCN for identifying spatial domains, which is a Multi-view
   Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with attention mechanism. We first
   construct two neighbor graphs using gene expression profiles and spatial
   information, respectively. Then, a multi-view GCN encoder is designed to
   extract unique embeddings from both the feature and spatial graphs, as
   well as their shared embeddings by combining both graphs. Finally, a
   zero-inflated negative binomial decoder is used to reconstruct the
   original expression matrix by capturing the global probability
   distribution of gene expression profiles. Moreover, Spatial-MGCN
   incorporates a spatial regularization constraint into the features
   learning to preserve spatial neighbor information in an end-to-end
   manner. The experimental results show that Spatial-MGCN outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods consistently in several tasks, including
   spatial clustering and trajectory inference.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), with their powerful ability to
   model non-Euclidean graph data, have shown advantages in learning
   representations of brain networks. However, considering the complexity,
   multilayeredness, and spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activities, we
   have identified two limitations in current GCNbased research on brain
   networks: 1) Most studies have focused on unidirectional information
   transmission across brain network levels, neglecting joint learning or
   bidirectional information exchange among networks. 2) Most of the
   existing models determine node neighborhoods by thresholding or simply
   binarizing the brain network, which leads to the loss of edge weight
   information and weakens the model's sensitivity to important information
   in the brain network. To address the above issues, we propose a multi
   -level dynamic brain network joint learning architecture based on GCN
   for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Specifically, firstly,
   constructing different -level dynamic brain networks. Then, utilizing
   joint learning based on GCN for interactive information exchange among
   these multi -level brain networks. Finally, designing an edge self
   -attention mechanism to assign different edge weights to inter -node
   connections, which allows us to pick out the crucial features for ASD
   diagnosis. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 81.5 %. The
   results demonstrate that our method enables bidirectional transfer of
   high -order and low -order information, facilitating information
   complementarity between different levels of brain networks.
   Additionally, the use of edge weights enhances the representation
   capability of ASD-related features.

AB The rod-fastened rotor is a critical component of heavy-duty gas
   turbines, and therefore, it is imperative to investigate its failure
   mechanisms and develop intelligent diagnostic techniques. The issue of
   effective cross-domain diagnosis has garnered significant interest
   considering the changing operating conditions of rod-fastened rotors. To
   mitigate the effects of limited data samples or high collection costs in
   the target domain, we introduce a fault diagnosis model named the
   task-generalization-based graph convolutional network (TG-GCN), which
   leverages adversarial perturbations within a meta-learning framework to
   enhance the robustness of prior knowledge incorporated into the graph
   convolutional network. Initially, the method involves generating
   adversarial training samples in proximity to the distribution of the
   source-domain data by optimizing the worst case formulation to enhance
   generalization to task distribution. Next, the support set and the query
   set are simultaneously fed into the feature extraction network, yielding
   corresponding feature vectors. Subsequently, similarities between
   feature vectors and the degree of dispersion are computed in the task
   space, serving as connection weights for constructing the graph network
   model aimed at executing fault diagnosis. The proposed TG-GCN framework
   employs the introduction of data augmentation during the iteration
   process, which helps to strengthen the vulnerable components of the
   network by connecting them with the worst case perturbations. Moreover,
   we employed a rod-fastened rotor experimental system to elucidate the
   underlying failure mechanisms and corroborate the superiority of the
   TG-GCN.

AB The present work entails the synthesis of thermally modified graphitic
   carbon nitride (GCN) using a two-step thermal treatment procedure and
   its subsequent use in the photocatalytic reduction of toxic pollutants
   such as rhodamine B dye (RhB) and chromium (VI) (Cr(VI)) from aquatic
   environments. The as-synthesised exfoliated GCN (GCNX) is characterised
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectros-copy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Bru-nauer-Emmett-Teller analysis (BET),
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy
   (PL), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These characterisations helped
   to elucidate the phase formation, chemical structure, composition,
   surface area, optical properties, and morphology of the sample. With
   assistance from a visible light source, GCNX can degrade RhB dye within
   30 min in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and reduce Cr(VI) to
   Cr(III) in under 2 h in the presence of formic acid (FA/HCOOH).
   Variations in different catalytic parameters, including catalyst amount,
   pH of the solution, initial RhB or Cr(VI) concentration, and variation
   in H2O2 or FA concentration, are performed to inspect their effects on
   the photodegradation activity of GCNX. Moreover, the GCNX catalyst
   exhibits impressive stability and reusability. A thorough statistical
   evaluation follows the response surface methodology to under-stand the
   complex interaction between the factors contributing to the catalytic
   activity. The band alignment of differently functionalised GCN blocks in
   their pristine form and their H2O2/FA-adsorbed states is investigated
   using first-principles calculations to provide a further understanding
   of the RhB and Cr(VI) reduction mecha-nisms. The modified GCN can thus
   be effectively employed as a low-cost material for removing
   contamination from aquatic environments.

AB The spread of online rumor poses challenges to social peace and public
   order. Traditional research on rumor diffusion commences from the rumor
   itself, without considering the symbiosis and confrontation of
   anti-rumor and motivation-rumor. This study proposed a diffusion method
   for online rumor based on three messages: rumor, anti-rumor, and
   motivation-rumor. First, considering the ability of representation
   learning to learn unsupervised features, we decided to use
   representation learning method to the diversity and complexity of the
   content and structure feature space. In particular, we designed a new
   representation method-Rumor2vec-for the potential structural feature of
   the rumor diffusion network. Second, considering the mutual promotion
   and suppression of the three messages, we constructed a new network
   topology using the cooperative and competitive relationships based on
   the evolutionary game theory. Finally, considering the ability of graph
   convolutional network (GCN) to convolute non-Euclidean structure data
   such as social network, and in view of the time effectiveness of topic
   evolution, this study proposed a dynamic and game-GCN (evolutionary game
   theory GCN)-based rumor diffusion model. Experiments show that the model
   can not only predict the group behavior under the rumor topic but also
   accurately reflect the cooperation and competition among multiple
   messages.

AB Significant efforts have been made for vehicle-to-vehicle communications
   that now enable the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, current IoV
   solutions are unable to capture traffic data both accurately and
   securely. Another drawback of current IoV models that are based on deep
   learning is that the methods used do not tune hyperparameters
   efficiently. In this paper, a new system known as Secure and Intelligent
   System for the Internet of Vehicles (SISIV) is developed. A deep
   learning architecture based on graph convolutional networks and an
   attention mechanism are implemented. In addition, blockchain technology
   is used to protect data transmission between nodes in the IoV system.
   Moreover, the hyperparameters of the generated deep learning model are
   intelligently selected using a branch-and-bound technique. To validate
   SISIV, experiments were conducted on four networked vehicle databases
   dealing with prediction problems. In terms of forecasting rate (> 90%),
   F-measure (> 80%), and attack detection (< 75%), the results clearly
   show the superiority of SISIV over baseline systems. Moreover, compared
   to state-of-the-art solutions based on traffic prediction, SISIV enables
   efficient and reliable prediction of traffic flow in an IoV context.

AB Design space exploration in logic synthesis and parameter tuning in
   physical design require a massive amount of compute resources in order
   to meet tapeout schedules. To address this need, cloud computing
   provides semiconductor and electronics companies with instant access to
   scalable compute resources. However, deploying electronic design
   automation (EDA) jobs on the cloud requires EDA teams to deeply
   understand the characteristics of their jobs in cloud environments.
   Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on these
   characteristics. Thus, in this article, we first formulate the problem
   of moving EDA jobs to the cloud. To address the problem, we characterize
   the performance of four EDA main applications, namely: 1) synthesis; 2)
   placement; 3) routing; and 4) static timing analysis. We show that
   different EDA jobs require different compute configurations in order to
   achieve the best performance. Using observations from our
   characterization, we propose a novel model based on graph convolutional
   networks to predict the total runtime of a given stage on different
   configurations. Our model achieves a prediction accuracy of 87%.
   Furthermore, we present a new formulation for optimizing cloud
   deployments in order to reduce costs while meeting deadline constraints.
   We present a pseudopolynomial optimal solution using a multichoice
   knapsack mapping that reduces deployment costs by 35.29%, with minimal
   overhead to the total runtime. In addition, we describe a cloud-ready
   solution, called EDA analytics central, for the continuous optimization
   of a design across an EDA flow. We used this system in building our
   runtime prediction model.

AB A recommendation algorithm combined with a knowledge graph enables
   auxiliary information on items to be obtained by using the knowledge
   graph to achieve better recommendations. However, the recommendation
   performance of existing methods relies heavily on the quality of the
   knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs often contain noise and irrelevant
   connections between items and entities in the real world. This knowledge
   graph sparsity and noise significantly amplifies the noise effects and
   hinders the accurate representation of user preferences. In response to
   these problems, an improved collaborative recommendation model is
   proposed which integrates knowledge embedding and graph contrastive
   learning. Specifically, we propose a knowledge contrastive learning
   scheme to mitigate noise within the knowledge graph during information
   aggregation, thereby enhancing the embedding quality of items.
   Simultaneously, to tackle the issue of insufficient user-side
   information in the knowledge graph, graph convolutional neural networks
   are utilized to propagate knowledge graph information from the item side
   to the user side, thereby enhancing the personalization capability of
   the recommendation system. Additionally, to resolve the over-smoothing
   issue in graph convolutional networks, a residual structure is employed
   to establish the message propagation network between adjacent layers of
   the same node, which expands the information propagation path.
   Experimental results on the Amazon-book and Yelp2018 public datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the best baseline models
   by 11.4% and 11.6%, respectively, in terms of the Recall@20 evaluation
   metric. This highlights the method's efficacy in improving the
   recommendation accuracy and effectiveness when incorporating knowledge
   graphs into the recommendation process.

AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are important techniques for
   analytics tasks related to graph data. To date, most GCNs are designed
   for a single graph domain. They are incapable of transferring knowledge
   from/to different domains (graphs), due to the limitation in graph
   representation learning and domain adaptation across graph domains. This
   paper proposes a novel Graph Contrastive Learning Network (GCLN) for
   unsupervised domain adaptive graph learning. The key innovation is to
   enforce attraction and repulsion forces within each single graph domain,
   and across two graph domains. Within each graph, an attraction force
   encourages local patch node features to be similar to global
   representation of the entire graph, whereas a repulsion force will repel
   node features so they can separate network from its permutations (i.e.
   domain-specific graph contrastive learning). Across two graph domains,
   an attraction force encourages node features from two domains to be
   largely consistent, whereas a repulsion force ensures features are
   discriminative to differentiate graph domains (i.e. cross-domain graph
   contrastive learning). The within- and cross-domain graph contrastive
   learning is carried out by optimizing an objective function, which
   combines source classifier and target classifier loss, domain-specific
   contrastive loss, and cross-domain contrastive loss. As a result,
   feature learning from graphs is facilitated using knowledge transferred
   between graphs. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GCLN
   outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network algorithms.

AB With the proliferation of multi-modal data generated by various sensors,
   unsupervised multi-modal hashing retrieval has been extensively studied
   due to its advantages in storage, retrieval efficiency, and label
   independence. However, there are still two obstacles to existing
   unsupervised methods: (1) As existing methods cannot fully capture the
   complementary and co-occurrence information of multi-modal data,
   existing methods suffer from inaccurate similarity measures. (2)
   Existing methods suffer from unbalanced multi-modal learning and data
   semantic structure being corrupted in the process of hash codes
   binarization. To address these obstacles, we devise an effective
   CLIP-based Adaptive Graph Attention Network (CAGAN) for large-scale
   unsupervised multi-modal hashing retrieval. Firstly, we use the
   multi-modal model CLIP to extract fine-grained semantic features, mine
   similar information from different perspectives of multi-modal data and
   perform similarity fusion and enhancement. In addition, this paper
   proposes an adaptive graph attention network to assist the learning of
   hash codes, which uses an attention mechanism to learn adaptive graph
   similarity across modalities. It further aggregates the intrinsic
   neighborhood information of neighboring data nodes through a graph
   convolutional network to generate more discriminative hash codes.
   Finally, this paper employs an iterative approximate optimization
   strategy to mitigate the information loss in the binarization process.
   Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
   proposed method significantly outperforms several representative hashing
   methods in unsupervised multi-modal retrieval tasks.

AB The demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the predictive physical
   and virtualized network management in cellular networks, which can
   effectively reduce both the capital and operational expenditures by
   fully exploiting the network infrastructure. In this paper, we study the
   per-cell demand forecasting in cellular networks. The success of demand
   forecasting relies on the effective modeling of both the spatial and
   temporal aspects of the per-cell demand time series. However, the main
   challenge of the spatial relevancy modeling in the per-cell demand
   forecasting is the irregular spatial distribution of cells in a network,
   where applying grid-based models (e.g., convolutional neural networks)
   would lead to degradation of spatial granularity. In this paper, we
   propose to model the spatial relevancy among cells by a dependency graph
   based on spatial distances among cells without the loss of spatial
   granularity. Such spatial distance-based graph modeling is confirmed by
   the spatiotemporal analysis via semivariogram, which suggests that the
   relevancy between any two cells declines as their spatial distance
   increases. Hence, the graph convolutional networks and long short-term
   memory (LSTM) from deep learning are employed to model the spatial and
   temporal aspects, respectively. In addition, the deep graph-sequence
   model, graph convolutional LSTM, is further employed to simultaneously
   characterize both the spatial and temporal aspects of mobile demand
   forecasting. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed graph-sequence
   demand forecasting model could achieve a superior forecasting
   performance compared with the other two proposed models as well as the
   traditional auto regression integrated moving average time series model.

AB Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures is vital for medical
   image analysis. The state-of-the-art accuracy is typically achieved by
   supervised learning methods, where gathering the requisite
   expert-labeled image annotations in a scalable manner remains a main
   obstacle. Therefore, annotation-efficient methods that permit to produce
   accurate anatomical structure segmentation are highly desirable. In this
   work, we present Contour Transformer Network (CTN), a one-shot anatomy
   segmentation method with a naturally built-in human-in-the-loop
   mechanism. We formulate anatomy segmentation as a contour evolution
   process and model the evolution behavior by graph convolutional networks
   (GCNs). Training the CTN model requires only one labeled image exemplar
   and leverages additional unlabeled data through newly introduced loss
   functions that measure the global shape and appearance consistency of
   contours. On segmentation tasks of four different anatomies, we
   demonstrate that our one-shot learning method significantly outperforms
   non-learning-based methods and performs competitively to the
   state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning methods. With minimal
   human-in-the-loop editing feedback, the segmentation performance can be
   further improved to surpass the fully supervised methods.

AB The application of graph convolutional networks (GCN) in hyperspectral
   image (HSI) classification has become a promising method, thanks to its
   flexible convolution operation in any irregular image region. For the
   classification of HSI, GCN can extract more superpixel-level features
   with a topological structure, in comparison to the traditional
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using fixed square kernels
   distilling pixel-level features. To fully leverage the different levels
   of features, this study proposes a novel deep network referred to as a
   CNN-combined graph residual network (C2GRN), which integrates the
   multilevel graph residual module and spectral-spatial features
   continuous learning module. During the extraction of topology
   information using the former module, HSI pixels are divided into
   superpixels and served as input nodes of the module to reduce the
   computational complexity and obtain the multilevel spatial relevance
   between adjacent superpixels. Besides, for the latter module, the
   spectral-spatial features are learnt continuously, which could obtain
   the finer pixel-level features. Finally, the captured spectral-spatial
   features of different levels are concatenated. This strategy could not
   only adequately utilize the correlation and difference of adjacent
   spatial but also obtain the finer and more valuable spectral-spatial
   information, which makes a significant boost in the HSI classification.
   Additionally, the experiment results demonstrate the superiority and
   availability of the C2GRN on three benchmark datasets of HSI, compared
   with the state-of-the-art methods for the classification of HSI.

AB Semi-supervised network representation learning is becoming a hotspot in
   graph mining community, which aims to learn low-dimensional vector
   representations of vertices using partial label information. In
   particular, graph neural networks integrate structural information and
   other side information like vertex attributes to learn node
   representations. Although the existing semi-supervised graph learning
   performs well on limited labeled data, it is still often hampered when
   labeled dataset is quite small. To mitigate this issue, we propose
   PMNRL, a pseudo-multitask learning framework for semi-supervised network
   representation learning to boost the expression power of graph networks
   such as vanilla GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks) and GAT (Graph
   Attention Networks). In PMNRL, by leveraging the community structures in
   networks, we create a pseudo task that classifies nodes' community
   affiliation, and conduct a joint learning of two tasks (i.e., the
   original task and the pseudo task). Our proposed scheme can take
   advantage of the inherent connection between structural proximity and
   label similarity to improve the performance without the need to resort
   to more labels. The proposed framework is implemented in two ways:
   two-stage method and end-to-end method. For two-stage method,
   communities are first detected and then the community affiliations are
   used as "labels" along with original labels to train the joint model. In
   end-to-end method, the unsupervised community learning is combined into
   the representation learning process by shared layers and task-specific
   layers, so as to encourage the common features and specific features for
   different tasks at the same time. The experimental results on three
   real-world benchmark networks demonstrate the performance improvement of
   the vanilla models using our framework without any additional labels,
   especially when there are quite few labels.

AB The operation of public bike sharing (PBS) programs has attracted
   attention again due to numerous problems encountered by free-floating
   bike sharing programs. These problems include malicious damage, theft,
   chaotic parking, large-scale deficit and bankruptcy. The short-time
   demand prediction is a key issue for the successful operation of PBS
   programs. In this study, we use a novel spatio-temporal graph
   convolutional network (STGCN) to predict the picking up/returning demand
   by exploring potential information from multi-view data. We apply graph
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to represent the spatial dependency
   based on the geographic information system data denoting the location of
   docks. Moreover, we use gated CNNs to denote the temporal dependency
   according to the time-series data representing the demand for picking
   up/returning public bikes. The STGCN and three recurrent neural network
   (RNN)-based competitors are trained and validated using the multi-view
   data from the Wenling PBS program for one month. The RNN-based
   competitors consist of the SimpleRNN, long short term memory and gated
   recurrent unit. Results show that the STGCN achieves higher prediction
   accuracy compared with its competitors. Although the STGCN consumes a
   longer training time compared with the SimpleRNN, it requires a minimal
   number of epochs to achieve convergence precision. The complete CNN
   structure in the STGCN can effectively address the spatial and temporal
   dependencies for PBS demand prediction.

AB Background Apicomplexa consist of numerous pathogenic parasitic
   protistan genera that invade host cells and reside and replicate within
   the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Through this interface, the parasite
   exchanges nutrients and affects transport and immune modulation. During
   the intracellular life-cycle, the specialized secretory organelles of
   the parasite secrete an array of proteins, among which dense granule
   proteins (GRAs) play a major role in the modification of the PV. Despite
   this important role of GRAs, a large number of potential GRAs remain
   unidentified in Apicomplexa.Methods A multi-view attention graph
   convolutional network (MVA-GCN) prediction model with multiple features
   was constructed using a combination of machine learning and genomic
   datasets, and the prediction was performed on selected Neospora caninum
   protein data. The candidate GRAs were verified by a CRISPR/Cas9 gene
   editing system, and the complete NcGRA64(a,b) gene knockout strain was
   constructed and the phenotypes of the mutant were analyzed.Results The
   MVA-GCN prediction model was used to screen N. caninum candidate GRAs,
   and two novel GRAs (NcGRA64a and NcGRA64b) were verified by gene
   endogenous tagging. Knockout of complete genes of NcGRA64(a,b) in N.
   caninum did not affect the parasite's growth and replication in vitro
   and virulence in vivo.Conclusions Our study showcases the utility of the
   MVA-GCN deep learning model for mining Apicomplexa GRAs in genomic
   datasets, and the prediction model also has certain potential in mining
   other functional proteins of apicomplexan parasites.

AB Online reviews play a significant role in purchase decisions of
   consumers by providing feedback information from buyers of products. In
   order to mislead consumers, opinion spammers are hired to write fake
   reviews to promote or demote specific products for illegitimate
   benefits. Existing methods for spam review detection mainly focused on
   designing manual features, which highly rely on expert knowledge.
   Although recent works utilized deep learning methods to automatically
   learn the semantics of reviews through the inherent user-review-product
   strong relation, they fail to capture the weak relations between reviews
   at the content, sentiment and temporal levels, which provides various
   semantic information to expose fake reviews. Moreover, the imbalanced
   class distribution in spam detection issues makes this work even more
   challenging. To address the above problems, we propose a novel
   Weak-Strong Unified Network (WSUN) for opinion spam detection.
   Multi-level weak relation graphs are constructed to reveal the abnormal
   behavioral patterns of spammers, which aggregates the semantics of
   strong relations by graph convolutional networks and extracts
   comprehensive review representation by utilizing relation-level
   attention mechanism. In addition, a graph-based over-sampling method is
   devised to mitigate the impact of imbalanced class distribution.
   Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our
   model is more effective than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Nowadays, as a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems,
   traffic flow prediction has received extensive concern. However, most of
   the existing studies extracted spatial-temporal features with modules
   that do not differentiate with time and space, and failed to consider
   spatial temporal heterogeneities. Furthermore, although previous works
   have achieved synchronous modeling of spatial-temporal dependencies, the
   consideration of temporal causality is still lacking in their graph
   structures. To address these shortcomings, a spatial-temporal
   heterogeneous and synchronous graph convolution network (STHSGCN) is
   proposed for traffic flow prediction. To be specific, separate dilated
   causal spatial-temporal synchronous graph convolutional networks
   (DCSTSGCNs) for various node clusters are designed to reflect spatial
   heterogeneity, different dilated causal spatial-temporal synchronous
   graph convolutional modules (DCSTSGCMs) for diverse time steps are
   deployed to take account of temporal heterogeneity. In addition, causal
   spatial-temporal synchronous graph (CSTSG) is proposed to capture
   temporal causality in spatial temporal synchronous learning. We further
   conducted extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the
   results verified the consistent superiority of our proposed approach
   compared with various existing baselines.
